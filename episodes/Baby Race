The episode opens at the playground. Bluey swings from the monkey bars. Chilli holds Bingo up so she can grab onto the rings.
Bluey: "Mum, am I better at the monkey bars than Bingo?"
Chilli: "Well, you are two years older than her, Bluey."
Bluey: "Am I better than Judo?"
Chilli: "You're about the same as Judo."
Bluey: "I'm not! Judo cant do skip bar or backwards one bar.
She demonstrates skip bar and backwards one bar.
Chilli: "Well, she'll get there one day."
Bluey: "But am I better than her on this day?"
Chilli sets Bingo down.
Chilli: "Bluey, just run your own race."
Bluey: "Huh? What does that mean?"
She drops to the ground. Chilli and Bingo take a seat on the monkey bar platform.
Chilli: "Come here." 
Bluey jumps up and takes a seat next to Chilli.
Chilli: "Have I told you the story of when you took your first steps?"
She taps Bluey on the nose.
Bluey: "Ooh! No!"
Chilli: "Well, it all started when you were still a baby."
In the past, baby Bluey lays on her stomach on the kiwi rug, drooling and burbling. She wears a red nappy.
The camera cuts to Bandit - also lying face down on the kiwi rug, snoring and drooling.
The camera pulls back. This version of the play room is almost empty, save for a treadmill and dumbbell in the corner. The last strip of polka-dot wallpaper has not yet been put up. Chilli waves a rattle over Bluey. These younger versions of Chilli and Bandit do not have grey hairs in their fur.
Chilli: "Come on, Bluey. Roll over. Roll over!" 
Baby Bluey stops drooling, sees her mom and rolls over to her back. The scene cuts to a first-person view from Bluey's perspective, and the room spins as she rolls over.
Chilli: "You learned to roll over really early."
Baby Bluey coos and reaches for Chilli.
Chilli: "BANDIT!!! She rolled over!! She rolled over!!"
Bandit wakes with a start. The scene cuts back to Bluey's point of view.
Chilli: "She's not meant to do that for ages!"
Bandit leans over Bluey, eclipsing Chilli.
Bandit: "Aw, that's my girl!"
Baby Bluey shoves Bandit out of the way, then giggles.
Back in the present:
Bingo: "Hang on, where was I?"
Chilli: "You weren't born yet, sweetheart."
Bingo: "Ooh, I was invisible!"
Bluey: "Were you proud of me for rolling over so soon?"
Chilli: "Yes. A little too proud."
At Nana's house, in the past. Bandit prepares to change Bluey's diaper on the floor, while Chilli and Nana watch, drinking tea.
Chris: "Oh, I've never heard of a baby rolling over that early!"
Chilli: "I know!"
Chris: "She's just special."
Bandit opens Bluey's diaper. He coughs and retches, turning his head away.
The camera cuts to Mothers' Group, in a bright room with arched windows. Baby versions of Coco, Bluey, Snickers, and Judo lay on the floor, looking at their respective mothers."
Chilli: "But then, one day at Mothers' Group..."
Chilli: (to Bella) "It is very early to roll over."
Bella: "Oh, you're so clever, Bluey!"
Wendy: "Oh!"
Chilli and Bella turn to look. The camera pans over to Snickers, Snicker's Mum, Judo, and Wendy. Judo is sitting up, though she wobbles around.
Wendy: "She's sitting, She's sitting! Oh, Judo, you're sitting all by yourself!" 
Baby Judo giggles.
Snickers' Mum: "Oh, goodness, that's very early to be sitting!"
Wendy: "Oh, well, you know, it's not a race."
Bluey: "But it was a race."
Bluey folds her arms and glares at Chilli.
Bingo: "A baby race!"
TITLE CARD - Baby Race
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Baby Race."
The camera cuts back to the playroom. The wallpaper is all up, and a string of flags hangs on the wall. There are several cardboard boxes on the floor; Bandit has opened one of them and is in the midst of assembling a baby activity station. He strains as he tries to bend a guard rail into position. Meanwhile, Chilli has set up a ring of pillows on the kiwi rug. She holds Bluey above it.
Chilli: "I don't know what got into me, but I was determined I'd get you walking before Judo's mum. I mean, Judo."
Chilli puts Bluey down among the pillows in a sitting position.
Chilli: "There you go..."
Bluey tips over. Chilli catches her before she falls and sets her back upright.
Chilli: "Steady...Bandit! She's sitting!"
Bandit: "Huh?"
Bandit lets go of the guard rail, which springs up and smacks him in the face.
Bandit: "Ack!"
The camera cuts to Bluey's point of view. She looks up at Chilli.
Chilli: "Good gi—"
Bluey falls over backwards.
Chilli: "Ah!"
Laying on her back among the pillows, Bluey giggles.
The scene cuts back to Mother's Group. The babies are all sitting.
Chilli: "But after a lot of practice, eventually, you sat up."
Bella: "Bluey, you're sitting!"
Bluey laughs.
Wendy: "Judo!"
Judo crawls along the rug in front of them, with Wendy walking behind her.
Wendy: "Oh, goodness, I just can't keep track of her!"
Baby Bluey babbles, then falls and laughs. Chilli watches Judo, sadly.
Back in the present:
Bluey: "Judo crawled before me as well?!"
Bingo: "Judo beat you again!"
Bluey: (accusingly) "And just what did you do about this?"
Chilli: "Well, I tried my best."
In the past, Bluey sits on the kiwi rug in the playroom. Chilli backs up a few paces. Behind them on the verandah, Bandit attempts to put on the papoose.
Bandit: "This thing, how d'you... c'mon..."
Chilli claps to get Bluey's attention.
Chilli: "Come on, Bluey, crawl to Mama! You can do it, you can do it!
Bluey: "Did I do it?"
Baby Bluey rolls across the floor, bumping off Chilli's foot. She sits up, then laughs again.
Chilli: "Not exactly."
In the present, Bluey laughs.
Bluey: "Why was I rolling?"
Chilli: "I dunno, kid. You didn't come with instructions."
The scene cuts to a doctor's office. A skeleton model hangs from a hook. Chilli sits across a desk from a doctor. 
Chilli: "The doctor said there was nothing to worry about."
Doctor: "Some babies just roll before they crawl."
Baby Bluey rolls across the office floor, bumping into the skeleton stand. She laughs.
The scene cuts to the Heelers' living room at night. Chilli sits on the couch, intently reading a baby book, with more than a dozen others piled beside her. Behind her, in the sun room, Bandit holds Bluey, pacing back and forth in the sun room. His eyes have bags under them.
Chilli: "But I wasn't having that."
Bandit: (listlessly) ♫ "99 bottles of thing on the wall..." ♫
Chilli: "Aha!"
The scene cuts back to the play room. Chilli and Bandit demonstrate crawling for Bluey.
Chilli: (coaxing) "It's fun to crawl."
Baby Bluey giggles.
Chilli: (coaxing) "Oh, how good is crawling? It's better than rolling."
Bandit puts his knee on an electronic book. It makes an elephant noise, as Bandit falls over clutching his knee.
Bandit: "YOW! My knees!"
Baby Bluey laughs loudly.
Back in the present:
Bluey: "Did I do it?"
Bingo: "Did Bluey crawl?"
Chilli: "Not exactly."
Back in the past, in the playroom, Chilli and Bandit crouch at one end of the kiwi rug. Bluey sits at the other end.
Chilli: "Come on, Bluey! You can do it! Crawl to me!"
Bluey reaches out to Chilli, then after a moment, she puts her hands on the floor. She pulls herself forward, sliding on her bum, giggling.
Bandit: "Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Bum shuffle!"
Back in the present:
Bluey: "Bum shuffle?!"
Chilli: "Bum shuffle."
The scene cuts to Mothers' Group. Bluey bum shuffles across the floor.
Chilli: "You were a bum shuffler."
Bluey bum shuffles past Coco and Snickers, who are crawling at this point. Judo stands upright, holding on to a stool.
Bella: "Woo hoo! Go Bluey!"
Chilli: "Meanwhile, Judo was pulling herself up on furniture..." 
Back in the present:
Chilli: "...which is the step right before walking."
Bluey: "And I was just bum shuffling around?!"
Bingo: "You are definitely not winning the baby race."
The scene cuts back to the doctor's office. Bluey bum shuffles across the floor.
Chilli: "The doctor said there was nothing to worry about."
Doctor: "Some babies just bum shuffle before they crawl."
Baby Bluey runs into the skeleton and falls over backwards, laughing. Chilli looks at her, concerned.
The scene cuts to the living room, late at night. Chilli types something on a laptop.
Chilli: "But I wasn't having that."
The scene cuts to the playroom. Chilli sets Bluey down on her hands and knees, with Bandit a few paces away.
Chilli: "See, feels good, doesn't it? Feels like you wanna crawl, right?"
Back in the present:
Bingo: "Did she crawl?"
Chilli: "Yes!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Hooray!"
Back in the playroom:
Chilli: "Backwards."

Chilli: "But Nana wasn't having that."
Chris: "Let's stop mucking around, eh? A bit of olive oil on those knees will do the trick."
She picks up a bottle of olive oil and applies it to Bluey's knees. She sets Bluey down on the floor.
Chilli: "But how is olive oil gonna h-"
Bluey attempts to crawl, but her knees slip out from under her and she falls flat on her stomach. She laughs.
Chilli: "Ohmygoodness!"
Bandit: "Mum, what are you doing?!"
Bluey gets up, and her knees slip again.
Chris: "If she can't crawl, she'll have to walk."
Bandit: "This isn't legal anymore!"
Bluey gets up on her knees and falls again.
Chilli: "Whoop!"
Nana bends down to scoop up a handful of soil from a potted plant.
Chris: "I'll sprinkle some grit down, too."
When she looks up, Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey are gone.
Chris: "Oh, where'd they go?"
Back in the present, Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Chilli: "Your Nana's old school."
The scene cuts back to Mothers' Group. Bluey crawls backwards. The other babies are walking. Snickers falls on his bum.
Chilli: "None of it mattered, though. Judo had won the baby race."

Bluey: "Were you upset with me that I lost the baby race?"
Chilli pulls Bluey into a side-hug.
Chilli: "No, sweetie."

Chilli: "Look, we were all learning to do things for the first time. I just felt like I was doing everything wrong."

Chilli: "But then, one day, Coco's mum came to see me."
Bella walks in, carrying Coco.
Bella: "Hi, Chilli."
Chilli: "Bella! Oh, hello. I'm so sorry, the house is a mess."
Back in the present:
Chilli: "We chatted for a while and then she showed me a photo."
Back in the past, Bella hands Chilli a photograph. It's a family photograph showing Bella, her husband, and their nine children, from infant Coco up to several teenagers.
Chilli: "Are these all your children?"
Bella: "Yep!"
Chilli: "I thought Coco was your first."
Bella: "No, I've got eight kids! Wait, no. Nine."
Chilli: "I had no idea! Wow... you must have learned a thing or two."
Bella: "I have. And there's something you need to know."
Bella puts her hand on Chilli's knee.
Chilli: "What?"
The camera cuts to Chilli's perspective, allowing Bella to deliver her next line directly to the camera.
Bella: "You're doing great."
Chilli tears up and embraces Bella, as Coco joins Bluey to play with the leaves.
Back in the present, Chilli dabs at her eye with a handkerchief. She sniffles.
Bingo: "Are they happy tears, Mum?"
Chilli: (voice breaking) "Yeah. Happy tears, honey."

Chilli: "Yeah! Bluey wins!"
