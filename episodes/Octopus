The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heelers' house in daytime. In the living room, Bluey runs up to a stool, and places a hairbrush on it.
Bluey: "You're gonna love this game, Chloe!"
Bluey runs over to Chloe. The two girls stand at once end of the couch, with the stool and hairbrush at the other end. Bandit kneels on the couch, leaning over the back of it.
Chloe: "How do you play it?"
Bluey: "Dad, can you explain it?"
Bandit waves his arms limply and babbles.
Bandit: "Blublublub blublublub!"
He blinks one eye, then the other.
Bluey and Chloe laugh.
Bluey: "Okay, I'll explain it. Dad's the octopus. That's why he talks like that."
Bandit: "Blupblululu!"
Bluey: "And we're fish or something, and we have to steal his treasure..."
Bluey points to the hairbrush.
Bluey: "...and get back to our fish home."
She points to the ground where they are standing.
Bluey: "Uh, is that all the rules, Dad?"
Octopus Bandit angrily waves his tentacles at the girls.
Bandit: "Blooloolooloo!"
Bluey and Chloe laugh.
TITLE CARD - Octopus
Chloe: "This episode of Bluey is called: Octopus."
The girls crouch down, ready to run. Their tails wag rapidly.
Bluey: "Come on, Chloe!"
Chloe: "Eee! How are we gonna get past?"
Bluey: "Don't worry, octopuses aren't very smart. Watch."
Bluey points behind Bandit.
Bluey: "Look, a robin!"
Bandit looks.
Bandit: "Obloblob?"
Bluey: "Come on!"
Bluey runs for the treasure. Bandit spots her, and grabs her arm, stopping her just short.
Bluey: "Aaah!"
Bandit: "Oblobloblob!"
Bandit tugs on her arm, spinning her in a circle. He flails wildly with his free hand.
Bluey: "Chloe, help!"
Chloe: "What do I do?"
Bluey: "Do that knee thing you do!"
Chloe: "Okay!"
Chloe grabs her right foot with her left hand, and jumps back and forth over her own leg.
Bandit: "Oblobloblob?"
Bandit stares, intrigued. Chloe switches feet, and performs her trick even faster.
Bandit: "Oblobloblob? Oblobloblob!"
Chloe takes a bow. Bandit applauds, letting Bluey go.
Bluey: "I'm free!"
Bandit: "Olb?"
Bluey takes the hairbrush, and Chloe runs to join her.
Bluey, Chloe: "Hooray!"
Bandit flails in panic. The girls laugh.
Bandit: "Oblobloblob! Oblobloblob! Oblobloblob!"
Bluey: "Now we have to get back!"
Chloe: "Let me try."
Chloe: "Look!"
She points behind Bandit. He looks.
Bandit: "Blobl?"
Chloe: "A cockatoo!"
They run past, giggling, as Bandit looks around for the cockatoo.
Bluey, Chloe: "Hooray!"
Bandit flails his arms at them as they stand just out of reach.
Bandit: "Oblobloblob!"
Bluey: "I told you they're not very smart!"
She taunts Bandit by waggling her bum at him. The doorbell rings.
Chloe: "My Dad's here."
Chloe and Bluey hug.
Chloe: "See ya, Bluey!"
Chloe runs off. Bluey waves good-bye.
Bluey: "Bye, Chloe!"
Bluey brushes her hair and hums. Bandit flails his arms at her.
Bandit: "Oblobloblob! Oblobloblob!"
The scene cuts to the Dalmatians' car. Chloe's dad, Frank, is driving.
Chloe: "Dad, can you play Octopuses with me when we get home? It's so much fun!"
Frank: "Um, yes, okay. That sounds like a good way to learn about sea creatures."
In the Dalmatians' living room, Chloe sets up a stapler on a side table. Frank leans over the back of the couch.
Chloe: "There. Now, you have to be an octopus."
Frank: "Ah, okay."
He clears his throat. He waves.
Frank: "Hi, I'm an octopus."
Chloe: "Octopuses don't talk like that."
Frank: "Well, octopi don't talk at all."
Chloe: "Yeah, they do. They go 'bloolooloo'!"
Frank: "Blub blub?"
Chloe: "Yeah, like that. But more."
Frank: "Blub blub blub blub?"
Chloe: "And you have to wave your arms about."
She demonstrates.
Frank: "They're actually called tentacles."
Chloe: "Okay. You have to wave your tentacles about."
Frank halfheartedly waves his arms.
Frank: "Blub blub..."
Frank: "Look, this all feels a bit silly. I think I'm just going to be a quiet octopus."
Chloe: "Okay... This is your treasure."
Frank: "I don't think an octopus would have treasure. That's more of a pirate thing."
Chloe: "But he has to, and I have to steal it."
Chloe runs to the other side of the couch and gets ready to start.
Chloe: "Ready?"
Frank: "Uh, I guess."
Chloe points behind him.
Chloe: "Look! A robin!"
Frank: "Why would a robin be under the sea?"
Chloe: "Daaad! You're not meant to be smart. You're an octopus."
Frank: "Okay. Got it."
Chloe runs for it. Frank easily grabs her with both hands.
Chloe: "Arghh! Let me try again."
Frank lets her go, and she runs back to the start. He easily catches her again.
Chloe: "Arghh!"
Frank: "Got you again."
Chloe: "Ugh, Dad, you're making it too hard."
Frank: "Okay, okay. Go again. I'll make it easy."
They try again. This time, Frank doesn't move. Chloe runs past him easily.
Chloe: "Dad, now it's too easy."
Frank shifts uncomfortably.
Frank: "Ugh, my knees!"
Chloe: "Let's try swapping."
Chloe takes the octopus position on the couch. She waves her arms enthusiastically.
Chloe: "Bloobloolooblooloobloo! Heehee!"
Frank: "Okay. Here we go."
Frank struts around the front of the couch, going behind Chloe. He holds up the stapler.
Frank: "Got it!"
Chloe: "No, Dad, you have to go along this bit."
She points to the back of the couch.
Frank: "But, this is the safer route."
Chloe: "Daaad!"
He puts the stapler back and returns to the start.
Frank: "Okay, okay. I'll go this way. And go!"
Chloe waves her arms at him. Frank walks in an arc, staying entirely out of her reach.
Chloe: "Blooblooloobloo!"
Frank takes the stapler, and walks back along the same path.
Chloe: "Blooblooloobloo!"
Frank: "I win!"
Chloe sighs, and slumps down on the couch.
Frank: "What's up, Chloe? Is the game over?"
Chloe: "Yes. You're not playing it properly."
Frank: "But this is how I play it."
Chloe: "Hmph! Bluey's Dad is more fun than you."
Frank: "Oh. I see."
Frank walks away sadly, as Chloe continues to sulk on the couch. He sits down at his computer. Chloe notices, and goes over to see what he's doing.
Chloe: "Hi, Dad."
Frank: "Hey, Chloe."
Chloe: "What are you reading?"
Frank: "Oh, I'm reading facts about octopi."
Chloe: "Oh. How come?"
Frank: "Well, I thought maybe it will help me play your octopus game better.
Chloe: "Oh!"
Frank: "Turns out, octopi are actually quite smart."
Chloe: "Really?"
Frank: "And you were right. They do collect treasure. See?"
He points to a picture on the screen. It shows an octopus hiding in a mussel shell.
Frank: "They collect objects to make their houses strong."
Chloe: "Ooh, wow!"
Frank: "So I'm sorry I said you were wrong."
Chloe: "Well, I'm sorry I said Bluey's Dad is more fun than you."
Frank: "That's okay. He probably is."
Chloe: "But you're fun, too, really! It's just that, every time I do something, you say, 'No, but octopuses don't do that.'"
Frank: "Do I?"
Chloe: "Yes!"
Frank: "Well that's funny, 'cause I feel like every time I say something, you say, 'No, octopuses don't do that.'"
Chloe: "Oh. Well, how about this rule? No-one is allowed to say, 'No, but octopuses don't do that.'"
Frank: "Okay. What shall we say instead?"
Chloe: "How about we can say, 'Yes! This octopus does that.'"
Frank: "Yeah! But in octopus, that sounds a bit like this:"
Frank leans back in his chair and flails his arms.
Frank: "Blublublublublu!"
Chloe: "Yeah!"
Chloe jumps up and they hug. Frank chuckles.
Chloe: "Is there any more things about octopuses?"
Frank: "Well, yeah, look."
He pulls up another page. This one shows an octopus squirting ink on a tuna.
Frank: "When an octopus is scared and wants to escape, it can shoot out a cloud of ink."
Chloe: "Wow! Ooh, what's that?"
Another image on the same page shows an electric eel.
Frank: "An electric eel. It's an eel that can make its own electricity."
Chloe: "Wow!"
Frank: "Animals don't like being hurt, so they do all sorts of things to avoid it."
Chloe: "Oh. What else is there?"
Frank scrolls down, to an image of a flying fish.
Frank: "Well, see this? It's a flying fish."
Chloe: "A fish that can fly?!"
Frank: "Yeah, just small distances, but still!"
Chloe: "That's clever."
Later on, Bluey knocks on the Dalmatians' front door. Chloe opens it.
Chloe: "Hey, Bluey!"
Bluey: "Hey, Chloe."
Chloe: "Do you want to play Octopus with us?"
Bluey: "Ooh, okay!"
The episode cuts to Frank on the couch, enthusiastically flailing his arms.
Frank: "Bloobloolooblooloobloo!"
Chloe: "Okay, this time we're eels."
Frank: "Got it. I'll be a South Moriba octopus."
Chloe: "Oh, no!" 
She turns to Bluey to explain.
Chloe: "That's a poisonous one! You have to freeze for four seconds if he touches you."
Bluey: "Ooh, okay!"
Chloe: "Let's go!"
Frank: "Bloobloolooblooloobloo!"
Chloe somersaults under Frank's tentacles, and makes it to the treasure. Bluey runs, but Frank catches her by the arm.
Bluey: "Arghh!"
Chloe: "Arghh! Bluey, he got you!"
Frank lets go of Bluey and flails his arms at Chloe.
Frank: "Bloobloolooblooloo! Bloo! Blooobloo!"
Bluey: "One, two, three..."
Chloe: "Don't worry, I'm an electric eel. Zzzt!"
She touches Frank with a fingertip. He pretends to convulse, then clutches his injured tentacle.
Frank: "Bloobloolooblooloo!"
Bluey runs past him.
Bluey: "Oh, wow!"
Bluey seizes the stapler.
Chloe: "Haha! Got your treasure!"
Frank: "Bloobloolooblooloo!"
Bluey: "How will we get back?"
Chloe: "Watch this. Look!"
She points behind Frank. He turns to look.
Frank: "Bloobl?"
Chloe: "A flying fish!"
Chloe squeals and runs past him. Bluey follows, but Frank throws a towel over her head.
Frank: "Bloobloolooblooloo!"
Bluey staggers around, blinded.
Bluey: "Arghh!"
Chloe: "He squirted ink on you!"
Frank grabs Bluey as she staggers past.
Bluey: "He did what?!"
Chloe: "Octopi can squirt ink out."
Bluey: "I didn't know that!"
Chloe: "Don't worry, I'll save you!"
She jumps up on the couch and pokes Frank in the ribs.
Chloe: "Zzt! Zzt! Zzt!"
Frank recoils. Bluey takes off the towel and runs to safety with the stapler.
Bluey: "I made it!"
Frank grabs Chloe by the waist and dangles her upside-down off the back of the couch.
Frank: "Bloobloolooblooloo!"
Chloe: "Argh! He's got me! Bluey! Help!"
Bluey: "What do I do?"
Chloe: "Turn into a flatback sea turtle!"
Bluey: "A what?!"
Frank: "Bloobloolooblooloo!"
Chloe: "Grab the cushion!"
Bluey: "Okay!"
Bluey grabs a couch cushion, puts it on her back, and crawls to Chloe.
Bluey: "Here comes the turtle!"
Frank flails at Bluey, but only brushes against her shell.
Frank: "Bloobloolooblooloo!"
Chloe: "Pull me, turtle, pull me!"
Bluey tugs on Chloe's arm...
Bluey: "Rrah. Ee-yah!"
...freeing her from Frank's tentacles.
Bluey: "Ha-ha! Let's go!"
Frank: "Bloobloolooblooloo!"
They crawl to safety.
Bluey, Chloe: "Yeah!"
Chloe: "We won!"
Bluey: "That was so fun!"
Chloe: "Yeah, it was, wasn't it?"
Bluey: "Can I be the octopus?"
Chloe: "Yeah."
Bluey climbs onto the back of the couch.
Bluey: "Can the octopus be poisonous and electric?"
Chloe and Frank make eye contact.
Chloe, Frank: "Yeah, this octopus can."
Bluey dances as a new arrangement of the episode theme plays.
