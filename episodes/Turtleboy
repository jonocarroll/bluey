The episode opens in the living room, early in the morning. Bingo lies on her side on a chair, listlessly watching television. The programme is an episode of Cat Squad. Three cats in colour-code armor have a discussion in the foreground, while a dog in a cartoon robber costume sits tied to a tree in the background.
Purple Armor Cat: "What did you learn today, Catty?"
Red Armor Cat: "How I behave doesn't just affect me..."
Bandit walks in, and stops directly in front of the television. He scratches his chin thoughtfully.
Bandit: "Now, what did I come in here to do?"
Red Armor Cat: "It affects everyone!"
Bingo: "Ah! Dad! You're in the way!"
Bandit: "In the way of what?"
Bingo: "The TV!"
Bandit: "Really? I don't see a TV."
The cat squad theme begins playing. The scene on the TV changes to the cat squad riding motorcycles.
Bingo: "Behind you!"
Bandit turns around.
Bandit: "Ah, there you go. Look at that. Cats riding motorbikes."
Bingo: "Aaah! I can't see!"
Bandit: "How do they get a driver's licence?"
Bingo: "MOVE!"
Bandit turns back around.
Bandit: "Did you want me to move?"
Bingo: "YES!"
Bandit: "Oh, you should have said."
Bandit begins to dance.
Bandit: ♫ "Movin', movin', movin'!" ♫
Bandit: ♫ "Movin', movin', movin'!" ♫
Bingo: "No, move out of the way!"
Bandit: "Oh, right. Sorry."
Bandit steps aside.
Bandit: "Is this better?"
Bingo slumps back down in her chair.
Bingo: "Yes. Thank you."
Bandit: "No worries! Oh. I remembered why I came in."
Bandit picks up the remote and turns off the television.
Bingo: "AHHHHH!"
Bandit: "We're going to the park."
TITLE CARD - Turtleboy
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called: Turtleboy."
Bandit and Bingo arrive at a small park. It has a basketball key, a cup spinner, a brick barbecue, and a five-swing swingset. Bingo runs up to the swingset.
Bingo: "Dad, can we play roller-coaster today?"
Bingo spots a turtle plush toy sitting on the mesh swing in the centre of the swingset.
Bingo: "Ooh! It's a turtleboy."
She picks it up.
Bandit: "Oh. Some kid must have left it behind."
Bingo: "In the middle of the roller-coaster?"
Bandit: "Nah, he probably left it somewhere else, but someone put him here so he'd be easier to find."
Bingo: "Can I play with him?"
Bandit: "Uh, yeah, sure."
Bingo: "Do you want to play roller-coaster with me, Turtleboy?"
Bingo makes Turtleboy's head nod.
A moment later, Bandit pulls the mesh swing back. Bingo lays on it, face down with Turtleboy.
Bandit: "Up comes the roller-coaster. Tick-tick-tick..."
Bandit lifts the swing even higher.
Bingo: "Eee! Hold on, Turtleboy!"
Bandit: "And...wow!"
Bandit pushes the swing.
Bingo: "Ahhhh!"
The swing swings back towards Bandit. He pokes Bingo in the stomach.
Bandit: "Poke."
Bingo giggles. She swings away, then swings back. He tries to poke her again...
Bandit: "Poke."
...but she lifts herself off the mesh and avoids him.
Cut to a brief shot of the basketball hoop.
Cut back to Bandit and Bingo. Bingo has Turtleboy on a strap swing, which she is twisting around and around.
Bandit: "Let's go, Bingo. Mum and Bluey will be back soon."
Bingo: "Okay."
Bingo takes Turtleboy off the swing and runs over to Bandit.
Bandit: "Oh, uh, Bingo, better leave Turtleboy here."
Bingo: "Aw. Why can't I take him home?"
Bandit: "It's not the done thing, mate."
Bingo holds Turtleboy a little tighter.
Bandit: "His owner might be looking for him."
Bingo: "Okay."
She takes him over to the mesh swing.
Bingo: "Bye, Turtleboy. I'll come back tomorrow."
She sets Turtleboy back in the centre of the swing and waves goodbye to him.
As Bandit and Bingo leave, a Cavapoo boy and his mum arrive at the park. The boy runs up to the swing and spots Turtleboy. He turns and signs to his mum.
Dougie: (Auslan) "Mum, look, turtle." 
Dougie's mum replies, speaking aloud as she signs in Auslan.
Dougie's Mum: "Oh wow, someone must've left him."
Dougie: (Auslan) "Can I play with him?"
Dougie's Mum: "Yeah. You can play with him."
Dougie's tail wags as he picks up Turtleboy.
Dougie runs around in the grass, holding Turtleboy over his head as his mum watches on. He swings on a strap swing with Turtleboy on his lap.
Cut to a brief shot of the midmorning sun over the treetops.
Dougie's Mum: "Time to go, sweetheart."
Dougie runs up to his mum holding Turtleboy.
Dougie's Mum: "Leave him there, honey. His owner might come back for him."
Dougie runs back over to the mesh swing and sets Turtleboy in the middle. He pats Turtleboy's head, then runs off.
Cut to an establishing shot of the Heelers' house at night. Time rapidly advances to morning.
Cut to the living room. Bandit is doing push-ups in the middle of the floor.
Bandit: "Hup."
Bingo runs in.
Bingo: "Dad, can I watch TV?"
Bandit: "Hup. Yeah, of course."
Bingo: "Hooray!"
Bingo hops up onto the chair.
Bandit: "I'll even watch it with you."
Bandit sits down next to Bingo.
Bandit: "Alright. Watching the TV."
Cut to the television. It's off.
Bingo: "Dad!"
Bandit: "What?"
Bingo: "I want to turn the TV on and then watch it."
Bandit: "Oh, right."
Bandit gets up and starts walking out of the room.
Bandit: "No chance. We're going to the park."
Bingo: "Arghhhh!"
Bingo and Bandit arrive at the park. Bingo runs up to the mesh swing and grabs Turtleboy.
Bingo: "Turtleboy!"
A moment later, Bandit sits on the ground, holding his phone. Bingo stands on the paver border of the swing area. Bandit starts a timer on his phone.
Bandit: "And go! Chk chk chk chk..."
Bingo starts running along the paver border, holding Turtleboy in front of her and pretending he's running.
Bandit: "Ah! Watch the crocodiles!"
Bingo: "Argh!"
She makes Turtleboy jump.
Bandit: "And the quicksand!"
Bingo and Turtleboy jump over a small pile of leaves on the pavers.
Bingo: "Ooh!"
Bandit: "Jump the snake!
Bingo and Turtleboy jump over a twig.
Bingo: "Eee!"
As Bingo and Turtleboy arrive back at Bandit, he stops the timer.
Bandit: "Chk chk chk stop! Oh, 23 seconds?! That's the fastest yet!"
Bingo: "Well done, Turtleboy."
A brief cutaway shows dark clouds over the treetops.
Bingo sets Turtleboy in the middle of the mesh swing.
Bandit: "Looks like it might rain."
Bingo: "We can't leave Turtleboy in the rain. He'll get wet."
Bandit: "He won't mind. He's a turtle."
Bingo: "Ooh! I know."
Bingo picks up Turtleboy and runs over to the barbecue. The barbecue has a hollow space underneath with with a few pieces of firewood and a newspaper; Bingo sets Turtleboy in the hollow, on the newspaper.
Bingo: "You'll be dry under here, Turtleboy."
As Bingo and Bandit leave, Dougie and his mum return.
Dougie looks at the empty mesh swing, disappointed - but he brightens up when he turns around and spots Turtleboy under the barbecue.
Dougie's Mum pushes him and Turtleboy on the mesh swing. Dougie runs around on the basketball key, swooping Turtleboy around.
A brief cutaway shows the sky entirely overcast with dark clouds. Leaves blow in the wind.
Dougie and his mum stand by the barbecue, with Turtleboy back underneath it.
Dougie: (Auslan) "Mum, can I take him home?"
Dougie's Mum: "No, honey. You can't take him home."
Dougie: (Auslan) "Why not?"
Dougie's Mum: "'Cause it's not the done thing."
Dougie and his mum walk away. The camera stays on Turtleboy as it starts to rain. It cuts to night, with rain still falling, then cuts again to morning sun.
Bingo runs up and picks up Turtleboy.
Bingo: "Turtleboy, you're still here!"
She hugs him.
Bingo: "And you're dry!"
Bandit swings on one of the strap swings, and he has started the other strap swing and mesh swing swinging as well. Bingo stands at the end of the swingset, holding Turtleboy.
Bandit: "Okay, Turtleboy, we've picked up the curry. Now to get home safe to the Turtle-missus. You ready?"
Bingo: "He's ready."
Bingo watches carefully for a moment, then throws Turtleboy.
Bingo: "Whoo!"
Turtleboy sails past the chains of all three swings, landing safely on the mesh swing.
Bandit: "Yeah!"
Bingo: "Yeah, he made it!"
Bandit stops swinging, looking queasy.
Bandit: "Oh, man. That's enough of that."
Bingo giggles.
In a brief cutaway, the morning sun streams through gaps in the canopy of a eucalyptus tree.
Bingo and Bandit stand by the swingset.
Bingo: "Dad, can I ever take Turtleboy home? I think his owner has forgotten him."
Bandit: "Well... look, if he's still here tomorrow, then maybe."
Bingo: "Hooray!"
Bingo runs off with Turtleboy.
Bandit: (to himself) "But I'm not sure it's the done thing."
Bingo arrives back at the barbecue.
Bingo: "One more night, Turtleboy. Then you can come home with me."
She sets Turtleboy under the barbecue.
Bingo: "Um... it might be a bit drier back here."
She pushes Turtleboy behind the firewood.
Bingo: "And, um..."
Bingo looks around guiltily.
Bingo: "... you might like to read the newspaper?"
She drapes the newspaper over him.
Bingo: "See you tomorrow."
She runs back to Bandit.
Bandit: "Ready, set, go!"
They both run off, laughing, as Dougie and his mum arrive.
Dougie looks under the barbecue. He turns to his mum.
Dougie: (Auslan) "Turtle's gone."
Dougie's Mum: "Maybe his owner came back for him."
Dougie droops a little. His mum gets down on one knee.
Dougie's Mum: "That's a good thing, sweetheart."
Dougie's Mum stands with her eyes closed and counts, while Dougie runs away to hide.
Dougie's Mum: "Five. Six."
Dougie spots the barbecue.
Dougie's Mum: "Seven. Eight. Nine."
He crawls through the storage nook and hides on the far side.
Dougie's Mum: "Ten! Ready or not, here I come!"
Dougie lifts the newspaper, revealing Turtleboy. He stands, throwing Turtleboy joyously in the air.
Dougie's Mum: "Found you!"
Dougie pretends to have Turtleboy drink from the pet dish attached to a water tap. He pushes Turtleboy on a bucket swing. He rides the spinner with Turtleboy. He doesn't looks like he's enjoying it, and his mum runs up to stop them.
A brief cutaway shows a few clouds in a blue sky.
Dougie walks Turtleboy along the paver border of the swingset.
Dougie's Mum: "Time to go, sweetheart."
Dougie: "Mum, can I keep turtle?"
Dougie's Mum: "No, honey. Pop him back where you found him."
Dougie takes turtleboy back to the barbecue. He looks around for a moment, and then hides Turtleboy behind a nearby tree instead.
The camera stays still, as the scene cuts to night, and then back to morning.
Bingo runs up and looks under the barbecue.
Bingo: "Turtleboy!"
She looks under the newspaper.
Bingo: "Huh? Turtleboy?"
She crawls around the side of the barbecue.
Bingo: "I can't find Turtleboy."
Bandit: "Oh, sorry, kid. Turtleboy's owner must have come back and found him."
Bingo: (sadly) "No. That's not what happened."
Bandit: "What do you mean?"
Bingo: "I hid Turtleboy under the newspaper so his owner wouldn't find him."
Bandit: "Oh, right. Well, that's definitely not the done thing, Bingo."
Bingo: "I know. I'm sorry."
Bandit knees down and hugs Bingo.
Bandit: "It's all good, kid."
Bandit: "Hey, hang on. Look."
Bandit points behind Bingo.
Bingo: "Huh? Turtleboy!"
She runs over and hugs Turtleboy.
Bingo: "I'm sorry I hid you from your owner. I'll never do it again."
Bandit holds Turtleboy over his head, as he and Bingo run through the grass. Bingo laughs. At the basketball key, Bandit makes a jump shot, throwing Turtleboy through the hoop. Bingo rides the spinner with Turtleboy.
Bingo: "Aaaaaaaah!"
Bandit runs up to stop the spinner.
A brief cutaway shows a blue sky with the morning sun hidden behind a tree. A bird calls softly.
Bandit: "Time to go, mate."
Bingo: "Can I take Turtleboy home?"
Bandit: "Well, I did say you could, but do you still want to?"
Bingo looks at Turtleboy and thinks.
In a cutaway shot, the morning sun shines brightly on a eucalyptus with flowers and fruit.
In the foreground, Turtleboy sits on the mesh swing. In the background, Bandit and Bingo walk away.
Bingo: "I hope Turtleboy's owner comes back soon."
Bandit: "Why's that?"
Bingo: "I don't want him to be lonely."
Dougie and his mum enter the park. Dougie spots Turtleboy on the swing and runs toward him happily.
The episode theme plays over the credits. Dougie runs in with Turtleboy, and runs in figure-eights, swooping Turtleboy up and down. He runs back offscreen just before the credits end.
