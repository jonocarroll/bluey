A title card shows Bluey dancing above the title "BLUEY". Pinball Lez by Custard plays.
Several Children: "BLUEY! RUFF RUFF!"
The episode opens with Bandit pushing Bluey in a stroller. They reach the gate to a fenced playground. Bandit opens the gate. Bluey jumps out of the stroller and runs inside.)
 Bluey: "Big girl swing!"
Bandit tries to shove the stroller through the gate. He tries from several angles, growing more frustrated, but it's too wide.
Cut to the swingset, which has a strap swing and a bucket swing. Bluey runs up to the strap swing.
Bluey: "I wanna go on the big girl swing!"
She climbs up and sits on it. Bandit walks up, and points to the bucket swing.
Bandit: "How about you go on this one?"
Bluey: "No. Not the chainy one!"
Bandit: "Okay."
Bandit walks behind her, getting ready to push.
Bluey: "I wanna go high as the clouds!"
Bandit rubs his eyes.
Bandit: "Alright."
Bandit pushes her with one hand. With his other hand, he pulls out his phone and starts to fiddle with it.
Bluey: "You're not pushing high enough!"
His phone starts to play cheerful music. He pushes her harder.
Bandit: "Okay, okay."
Cut to Bandit's perspective. He starts a game called "Salad Dodger" on his phone. It seems to be an homage to Fruit Ninja.
Bluey: "Not high enough!"
Bandit: "Alright."
Bluey: "HIGHER!"
Bandit: "Okay, okay!"
Bluey: "Push me higher daddy!"
Bandit: "Alright."
Bluey: "I wanna go high to the sky!"
At this point, Bluey is swinging well above the level of Bandit's head. He's still absorbed in playing Salad Dodger.
Cut to the gate. The stroller is wedged diagonally in the gate. Pinball Lez begins to play again as Rusty and Mackenzie squeeze under the stroller and run into the playground.
Cut to Bandit's perspective, still playing Salad Dodger with one hand while pushing Bluey with the other. Rusty and Mackenzie run into his field of view and begin dancing.
Bluey: "Mackenzie!"
Rusty: "Bluey!"
Cut to a side shot. Bluey is swinging so high the chains are going past horizontal.
Bluey: "Push me all the way round!"
Bandit: "Okay."
Bandit pushes Bluey even higher.
Bluey: "Higher!"
Bandit reaches up, and pushes Bluey hard. She swings entirely vertical. The shot goes to slow motion.
Bluey: "Yaaaaay!"
Mackenzie and Rusty cheer in slow motion.
Mackenzie, Rusty: "Bluuueeeey!"
Cut to Bandit's point of view. His game shows a high score. He chuckles. He tries to push Bluey again, but she's not there.
Bandit: "Uh. B- Bluey?"
He walks under the swingset, looking around. Bluey swings over the top, kicking Bandit in the bottom.
Bandit: "Oogh!"
He falls on his face, and his phone flies high in the air. It lands next to his face with the tinkle of broken glass. Bluey squeals with delight and kicks her legs.
Bluey: "Aaaaah!! AGAIN!"
Bandit laughs.
The title card plays again, showing Bluey dancing above the "BLUEY" title. Pinball Lez plays.
Several Children: "BLUEY! RUFF RUFF!"
