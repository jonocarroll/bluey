The episode starts at Woolcock Park, where Bluey can be seen attempting to ride a bike as Bandit watches her. She makes it a short distance before her bike falls over.
Bluey: Awww...
She gets back on the bike and tries again, only for the bike to fall over again.
Bluey: Grrrr!
Bandit: You sure you don't want some help?
Bluey: No.
Bluey gets back on the bike again, seemingly getting it on her third try. Unfortunately, this doesn't last as Bluey ends up crashing offscreen. Bandit cringes from seeing his daughter crash.
Bluey (offscreen): Grrr!
Bandit: So close!
The title card appears with the episode's title: Bike. Above the title is a backpack that's themed after a monkey.
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called Bike.
We cut back to Bandit sitting on the bench. Bluey walks over with her bike, frustrated. She drops the bike on the ground and tosses the helmet on top of the bike, sitting down.
Bluey: It's not fair! Why can't I just do it straightaway? 
Bandit: That's not how the world works, kid. 
Bluey: Then the world is silly!
Bandit: (laughs) Can't argue with that.
Bluey: I'm never riding that bike again!
Bandit: Okay.
Bluey angrily looks around until she spots Bingo walking up to a water fountain for a drink. She hits the button to activate it, jumping up to try and reach the water.
Bingo: Ooh. Ooh! 
Bingo walks to the back of the water fountain to climb up it, but slips down a bit.
Bingo: Eeh!
The button starts to unpress as Bingo gets closer to the water.
Bluey: Oh, the button is unpressing.
Bingo: (grunting) Almost...
The water finally goes out, leaving poor Bingo with no water to drink.;;
Bingo: Ohhh...
Bluey: Oh, poor Bingo.
Bandit: She'll figure it out.
Bandit: Hey, look at Bentley! 
Bentley can be seen trying to reach the monkey bars, but is too short to reach them.
Bentley: (grunting) I can't reach!
Bluey (offscreen): Oh, she can't reach the monkey bars.
Bentley tries a few more times to stretch her arm out to grab onto one of the bars, but no dice. Bentley groans from being unable to reach. Chloe gets onto the monkey bars and climbs onto them easily. Bentley tries again to reach the monkey bars without any success.
Bluey: Awww. 
Bandit: Hey, look at your cousin Muffin!
Bandit points to where Muffin is. Muffin can be seen drinking from a water bottle with the same monkey backpack we saw in the title card.
Muffin: Finished my water! 
Muffin puts the cap back on her water and puts it back in her backpack.
Muffin: Put it in my backpack! 
Muffin zips up her backpack and attempts putting it on her back.
Muffin: Put my backpack on my back! One arm through... now the other one.
She gets one arm through one strap, but isn't able to with the other. Muffin spins around a bit to get her arm to the strap.
Muffin: Come here, strap!
Bandit: She can't get the bag on.
Bluey: Oh Muffin, the strap's just there! Just stick your arm through!
Bandit: Look, Bingo's having another go.
We cut back to Bingo, who hits the button to activate the water fountain again. She quickly runs over and starts climbing the fountain as fast as she can before the water goes out.
Bluey: Go Bingo, faster!
Bandit: Come on, Bingo!
Bingo keeps climbing the fountain, slipping partway through.
Bandit (offscreen): Come on Bingo...
Bandit (offscreen): Come on Bingo!
Bingo almost makes it to the top of the fountain, though seemingly quick enough since the water goes out again on her.
Bandit (offscreen): Oh!
Bluey: Almost.
Bluey hears Bentley struggling offscreen and looks over. Bentley can be seen trying once more to get onto the monkey bars. This time, however, she has adopted a new strategy: jumping.
Bentley: Oof! 
Bentley: That's it.
Bentley backs up in preparation for a big jump to the monkey bars.
Bluey: Oh, she's gonna try and jump!
Bandit (offscreen): Okay, here she goes.
Bentley: Yeah! Jumping!
Bentley runs towards the monkey bars, jumping up to try and grab them. Unfortunately, she didn't jump high enough and fails to reach them.
Bluey and Bandit (offscreen): Ohhhh...
She ends up landing hard on the ground. Bentley gets back up and rubs her back.
Bentley: (gets up) Ow!
Bluey: She's okay.
Bandit: Woah, look at Muffin.
Bandit points to Muffin. Muffin is spinning around in a circle while shouting, what must be her strategy at trying to get her arm through the backstrap.
Bluey: Ah, don't spin 'round, Muffin! 
Muffin spins around faster while yelling gibberish until she slowly stops and falls on the floor, dizzy.
Bluey: Ah, she's dizzy! 
(Both Bluey and Bandit laugh)
Muffin: Woooahhh...
Muffin falls backwards onto her backpack.
Both Bluey and Bandit (offscreen): Oh!
Muffin growls, looking quite fed up.
Bandit: Oh boy, here comes the meltdown!
Muffin flails angrily.
Muffin: Uggggggh! This is unacceptable! 
Bluey and Bandit laugh at Muffin's tantrum. Muffin shakes her backpack while yelling at it.
Muffin: Why won't you go on my back you, bag?! 
Muffin throws her backpack on the ground, stomping on it while shrieking. Bluey and Bandit laugh at this.
Bandit: Woah, look at Bentley!
Bentley is back on the platform, ready to do another jump to get on the monkey bars.
Bandit (offscreen): Here she goes...
Bentley: Jumping!
Bentley makes her jump... pow! Close, but no cigar.
Bluey (offscreen): Aww.
Bandit (offscreen): Oh, so close!
Bentley starts to tear up from frustration. She flails angrily on the floor.
Bentley: Why can't I do it straightaway?! 
Bluey: Hey that's what I said!
We cut to Bingo, who made it at the top of the water fountain, close to the water stream. She has her mouth open, ready to drink some water. She makes it close, but the water stream goes out again. Bingo loses her grip on the water fountain and falls onto the sidewalk.
Bingo: Ow! Awww... 
Bingo tears up and sits under the water fountain, upset.
Bingo: I can't do it. I'll never be able to drink water again.
Bluey: And then I curled into a little ball too. Poor Bingo. I'll go and hold the button for her.
Bandit: (grabs her arm) Hang on, not so fast.
Bandit (offscreen): Let's just see what happens next.
We cut to Bingo, who is silently crying under the water fountain. We then cut to Muffin, who has her eyes closed and arms folded, turned away from the backpack. We finally cut to Bentley, who is silently crying on the floor. Bentley looks up to see Mackenzie swinging, deciding to get up and dust herself off. Bingo wipes her tears, she looks at the button. Muffin looks at her backpack. Bingo gets up and walks over to the button, holding it down. The music transitions into a slow version of "Ode to Joy" by Beethoven, played with an accordion and accompanied by wordless vocals.
Bluey: What's she doing?
Muffin turns around, looking at her backpack again. She thinks until she gets an idea.
Muffin: Ooh!
Muffin lays on the ground.
Bluey: What?!
Bentley tries reaching for the bars again, only to stop after she almost slips and falls. She clings to the side of the structure. She looks up and gets an idea.
Bentley: Wait a minute... 
Bluey: She's got an idea!
Bandit: Muffin's going for it.
Muffin crawls towards the backpack.
Bandit (offscreen): Come on, Muffin! You can do it, Muffin!
Bluey: Go Muffin!
Bandit: Look at Bentley,
Bentley climbs up the monkey bars by the sides.
Bandit: Go Bentley!
Both: Go Bentley!
Bandit (offscreen): Look at the focus!
Bingo is holding the button down still, causing the water fountain to start overflowing. We cut back to Muffin, who is crawling closer to the backpack.
Bandit (offscreen): She's gonna do it...
Bandit (offscreen): She's gonna do it!
Bentley is reaching closer to the first bar. The music reaches its peak.
Bluey: Go Bentley, you can do it!
Bingo is holding the button down more still, causing more water to flow down from the water fountain. Muffin is now very close to getting her backpack on.
Bandit (offscreen): Yes! Go Muffin!
Bluey: Yeah!
Muffin finally gets the backpack on her back, wagging her tail.
Muffin: Got it!
Both: Yeah!
Bluey: (laughs) Good one, Muffin.
Muffin stands up with her backpack on her back.
Muffin: Yeah!
We cut to Bentley, who is very close to grabbing the first bar.
Bentley: Almost. 
She finally grabs onto it.
Bentley: Yep! Got it!
Both: Yeah! Go Bentley!
Bentley: Yes!
Bandit: You beauty! 
Bluey: (laughs) That was great.
We cut to Bentley, who's now trapped on the bar.
Bentley: I'd like to get down, now.
Bandit: Whoo!
Bluey: How's Bingo doing?
Bingo is still holding the button down, now having plenty of water to drink... on the floor. Nontheless, she giggles and gets down to lap the water off the floor.
Both: Oh, Bingo...
Bluey: That's disgusting.
Bandit: That's less than ideal. But it's still a win.
Bandit gives Bingo a thumbs up.
Bandit: Nice work, Bingo!
Bingo keeps lapping up the water, giving a thumbs up. Bluey watches the birds fly by and gets an idea. Bluey gets up, and gets ready to ride her bike again.
Bandit: Nice work, Bluey.
Bluey gets on her bikes and rides off, smiling. We cut to the credits. Instead of Bluey dancing, we see Muffin's backpack be thrown to the usual spot. Muffin storms in and starts stomping on it like she did earlier in the episode.
