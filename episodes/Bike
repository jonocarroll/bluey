(birds chirping) 
Bluey: (bike falls over) Awww...
(she tries riding the bike again, it falls over again)
Bluey: Grrrr!
Bandit: You sure you don't want some help?
Bluey: No.
(Bluey tries riding the bike again, and crashes offscreen.)
Bluey (offscreen): Grrr!
Bandit: So close!
(title card appears)
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Bike.
(Bluey comes over with her bike, then tossing her bike and helmet on the ground, then sitting down.)
Bluey: It's not fair! Why can't I just do it straightaway? 
Bandit: That's not how the world works, kid. 
Bluey: Then the world is silly!
Bandit: (laughs) Can't argue with that.
Bluey: I'm never riding that bike again!
Bandit: Okay.
(Bluey looks around angrily, then spots Bingo walking over to the water fountain)
(Bingo presses the button to turn the water on)
Bingo: Ooh. Ooh! 
(Bingo tries to climb up to reach but slips)
Bingo: Eeh!
(The button is seen unpressing, as Bingo is getting closer to the water)
Bluey: Oh, the button is unpressing.
Bingo: (grunting) Almost...
(The water goes out)
Bingo: Ohhh...
Bluey: Oh, poor Bingo.
Bandit: She'll figure it out.
Bandit: Hey, look at Bentley! 
Bentley: (grunting) I can't reach!
Bluey (offscreen): Oh, she can't reach the monkey bars.
Bentley: (grunts) Ohhhh...
(Chloe comes by, and swings on the monkey bars)
Bentley: (whimpering)
Bluey: Awww. 
Bandit: Hey, look at your cousin Muffin!
Muffin: (drinks water) Finished my water! Put it in my backpack! Put my backpack on my back! One arm through... now the other one. (grunting) 
Muffin: (spins) Come here, strap!
Bandit: She can't get the bag on.
Bluey: Oh Muffin, the strap's just there! Just stick your arm through!
Bandit: Look, Bingo's having another go.
(Bingo presses the button again, and runs over to climb up to reach the water)
Bluey: Go Bingo, faster!
Bandit: Come on, Bingo!
(Bingo is climbing the fountain, but slips)
Bandit (offscreen): Come on Bingo...
Bandit (offscreen): Come on Bingo!
(water goes out) 
Bandit (offscreen): Oh!
Bluey: Almost.
(Bentley grunting offscreen)
Bentley: Oof! 
Bentley: That's it. (backs up)
Bluey: Oh, she's gonna try and jump!
Bandit (offscreen): Okay, here she goes.
Bentley: Yeah! Jumping!
Bluey and Bandit (offscreen): Ohhhh...
Bentley: (gets up) Ow!
Bluey: She's okay.
Bandit: Woah, look at Muffin.
Muffin: (spinning around, shouting)
Bluey: Ah, don't spin 'round, Muffin! 
Muffin: (yelling gibberish) Oooh!
Bluey: Ah, she's dizzy! 
(Both Bluey and Bandit laugh)
Muffin: Woooahhh... (falls over)
Both Bluey and Bandit (offscreen): Oh!
Muffin: Grrr...
Bandit: Oh boy, here comes the meltdown!
Muffin: Uggggggh! This is unacceptable! 
(both laugh)
Muffin: Why won't you go on my back you bag?! (she throws her backpack on ground, then stomps her backpack while shrieking)
(both laugh)
Bandit: Woah, look at Bentley!
Bandit (offscreen): Here she goes...
Bentley: Jumping! (falls)
Bluey (offscreen): Aww.
Bandit (offscreen): Oh, so close!
Bentley: Why can't I do it straightaway?! 
Bluey: Hey that's what I said!
(the scene shows Bingo about to get her water, right before it goes out, she then slips and gets hurt)
Bingo: Ow! Awww... I can't do it. I'll never be able to drink water again.
Bluey: And then I curled into a little ball too. Poor Bingo. I'll go and hold the button for her.
Bandit: (grabs her arm) Hang on, not so fast.
Bandit (offscreen): Let's just see what happens next.
(the scene cuts to show all the upset kids)
(Bentley looks up to see Mackenzie swinging, she then gets up and dusts herself off)
(Bingo wipes her tears, she looks at the button)
(Muffin looks at her backpack)
(Bingo gets up and walks over to the button, she holds it down)
Bluey: What's she doing?
(Muffin turns around, to look at her backpack again)
Muffin: Ooh! (lays down)
Bluey: What?!
Bentley: (grunting) Wait a minute... 
Bluey: She's got an idea!
Bandit: Muffin's going for it.
Bandit (offscreen): Come on, Muffin! You can do it, Muffin!
Bluey: Go Muffin!
Bandit: Look at Bentley,
(Bentley climbs up)
Bandit: Go Bentley!
Both: Go Bentley!
Bandit (offscreen): Look at the focus!
(Bingo is holding the button down still)
Bandit (offscreen): She's gonna do it...
Bandit (offscreen): She's gonna do it!
Bentley: (grunting)
Bluey: Go Bentley, you can do it!
(Bingo is holding the button down)
(Muffin gets her backpack on)
Bandit (offscreen): Yes! Go Muffin!
Bluey: Yeah!
Muffin: Got it!
Both: Yeah!
Bluey: (laughs) Good one, Muffin.
Muffin: Yeah!
Bentley: Almost. Yep! Got it!
Both: Yeah! Go Bentley!
Bentley: Yes!
Bandit: You beauty! 
Bluey: (laughs) That was great.
Bentley: I'd like to get down, now.
Bandit: Whoo!
Bluey: How's Bingo doing?
Bingo: (laughs, drinks water off pavement)
Both: Oh, Bingo...
Bluey: That's disgusting.
Bandit: That's less than ideal. But it's still a win. (gives Bingo a thumbs up) Nice work, Bingo!
Bingo: (drinks water while giving a thumbs up)
(birds chirping)
(Bluey gets up, and gets ready to ride her bike again)
Bandit: Nice work, Bluey.
(Bluey starts riding her bike)
