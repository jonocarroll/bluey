The episode starts at Woolcock Park, where Bluey can be seen attempting to ride her bike on the pavement of the basketball key. Bandit watches her from a park bench. She makes it a short distance before her bike falls over.
Bluey: "Awww..."
She gets back on the bike and tries again, only for the bike to fall over again.
Bluey: "Grrrr!"
Bandit: "You sure you don't want some help?"
Bluey: "No."
Bluey gets back on the bike again and starts forward. Cut to Bandit, watching his daughter. He winces as Bluey crashes offscreen.
Bandit: "So close!"
TITLE CARD - Bike
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called: Bike."
Cut back to Bandit, lounging on the bench. Bluey walks over with her bike, frustrated. She drops the bike on the ground and tosses the helmet on top of the bike, sitting down on the ground.
Bluey: "It's not fair! Why can't I just do it straightaway?"
Bandit: "That's not how the world works, kid."
Bluey: "Then the world is silly!"
Bandit laughs.
Bandit: "Can't argue with that."
Bluey: "I'm never riding that bike again!"
Bandit: "Okay."
Bluey angrily looks around until she spots Bingo walking up to a water fountain for a drink. Bingo hits the button to activate it, then walks around to the side. She stands on tip-toe, and then hops up, trying to reach the water.
Bingo: "Ooh. Ooh!"
Bingo walks to the back of the water fountain to climb up it, but slips down a bit.
Bingo: "Eeh!"
The button starts to unpress as Bingo gets closer to the water.
Bluey: "Oh, the button is unpressing."
The button continues to unpress, and the stream of water gets weaker. Bingo makes it to the top of the water fountain.
Bingo: "Almost..."
The water stops, leaving Bingo with no water to drink.
Bingo: "Ohhh..."
Bluey: "Oh, poor Bingo."
Bandit: "She'll figure it out."
Bandit: "Hey, look at Bentley! "
Bentley can be seen trying to reach the monkey bars, but is too short to reach them.
Bentley: "I can't reach!"
Bluey: (offscreen) "Oh, she can't reach the monkey bars."
Bentley tries a few more times to stretch her arm out to grab onto one of the bars. Bentley groans in frustration. Chloe gets onto the monkey bars and climbs onto them easily. She swings across them, out of frame. Bentley tries again to reach the monkey bars without any success.
Bluey: "Awww."
Bandit: "Hey, look at your cousin Muffin!"
Bandit points to where Muffin is. Muffin can be seen drinking from a water bottle, next to a monkey-themed backpack.
Muffin: "Finished my water!"
Muffin puts the cap back on her water and puts it back in her backpack.
Muffin: "Put it in my backpack!"
Muffin zips up her backpack and attempts putting it on her back.
Muffin: "Put my backpack on my back! One arm through... now the other one."
She gets one arm through one strap, but isn't able to get the other one through. Muffin spins around a bit to get her arm to the strap.
Muffin: "Come here, strap!"
Cut back to Bandit on the park bench. Bluey hops up and sits next to him.
Bandit: "She can't get the bag on."
Bluey: "Oh Muffin, the strap's just there! Just stick your arm through!"
Bandit: "Look, Bingo's having another go."
Cut back to Bingo, who hits the button to activate the water fountain again. She quickly runs over and starts climbing the fountain.
Bluey: (offscreen) "Go Bingo, faster!"
Bandit: (offscreen) "Come on, Bingo!"
Bingo keeps climbing the fountain, but slips down. She keeps going.
Bandit: (offscreen) "Come on Bingo... Come on Bingo!"
Bingo makes it to the top of the fountain, but the stream of water stops.
Bandit: (offscreen) "Oh!"

Bentley: "That's it."

Bandit: (offscreen) "Okay, here she goes."
Bentley: "Yeah! Jumping!

Bentley: "Ow!"
Cut back to Bluey and Bandit.
Bluey: "She's okay."
Bandit: "Woah, look at Muffin."

Muffin: "Waaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aah!"
Cut back to Bluey and Bandit.
Bluey: "Ah, don't spin 'round, Muffin! 
Muffin spins around faster, yelling gibberish.

Bandit: "Oh boy, here comes the meltdown!"
Cut back to Muffin. Muffin flails her arms and legs angrily.
Muffin: "Uggggggh! This is unacceptable!"
Bluey and Bandit laugh at Muffin's tantrum. Muffin shakes her backpack while yelling at it.
Muffin: "Why won't you go on my back you bag?!"
Muffin throws her backpack on the ground, jumping up and down on it while shrieking. Bluey and Bandit laugh at this.
Bandit: "Woah, look at Bentley!"

Cut back to Bluey.
Bluey: "Hey that's what I said!"
Cut to Bingo, who has climbed to the top of the water fountain, and is an inch from the water stream when it stops. She slips and falls to the ground.

Bingo: "I can't do it. I'll never be able to drink water again."
Cut back to Bluey.
Bluey: "And then I curled into a little ball too. Poor Bingo. I'll go and hold the button for her."
Bluey gets up, but Bandit puts a hand on her shoulder.
Bandit: "Hang on, not so fast."
Cut back to Bingo, sulking under the water fountain.
Bandit: (offscreen) "Let's just see what happens next.
Bingo sobs silently. Cut to Muffin, who has her eyes closed and arms folded, turned away from the backpack. Cut to Bentley, who is silently crying on the ground. She wipes away a tear, then looks up. Bentley looks up to see Mackenzie swinging across the monkey bars. She gets up, wipes her face, and dusts herself off. She glares at the monkey bars.
Bingo wipes her tears, then looks up at the button. Muffin looks at her backpack. Bingo gets up and walks over to the button, full of determination. She leans her whole weight against the button and keeps pressing it. Cut to Bluey, who sits back down on the park bench.
