Script
Bandit and Chilli walk into the living room. Bandit is holding a vacuum, while Chilli carries a basket.
Chilli: Oh man, I'm just not a fan of housework. 
Bandit: Let's just get through it, and then we can relax.
Bingo is riding on Bluey's back, which Bluey is acting as a horse.
Bingo: Giddy up! 
Bluey neighs.
Bluey: Ah! Housework! 
Bingo: Let's get out of here! 
Bluey and Bingo try to get away, before Chilli freezes them with magic.
Chilli: Freeze! 
Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo walk over to a blanket fort.
Chilli: We’re coming in here next, so I need you to tidy up the blanket fort. 
Bluey: Aw, but we're playing! 
Chilli: You can play after you're done tidying up. 
BOTH: Okay, mum. 
Chilli is seen spraying a window, then wiping it. Bandit is vacuuming the rug.
Bingo hops on one foot, with a blanket on top of her head lowering her ears.
Bingo: Eep, eep, eep, eep, eep eep, eep, eep! 
She gets to the other side.
Bluey appears in the scene, holding a bunched-up blanket.
Bluey: Boop-deep, boop-deep, boop-deep, boop-deep! 
Bingo walks back to the blanket fort.
Bingo: Ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ooh. 
She comes back with a blanket covering herself pretending to be a ghost.
Bingo: Ooooooh! She bumps into a chair. Ouch! Hehe! Ooooh! 
Bluey: Dee-do, dee-do, dee-do, dee-do! 
Bandit watches their crazy walks before turning the vacuum off.
Chilli: You done for the day, are you? 
Bandit: Check this out. 
Chilli: What is it? 
Bandit: These kids never just walk their normal walk. 
Chilli: What?
Bandit: Look, watch. 
Bluey: Diddly-bup-jup, diddly-bup-jup, diddly-bup-jup!
Bingo: Boo, boo boo, boo. 
Bandit: See? 
Chilli: I see what you mean. 
Bandit: Look! There they go again! 
The two watch Bluey's crazy walking.
Chilli: Come on, we got work to do. 
Bandit: Oh no, I'm not doing anything until one of these kids walk past here not like a complete fruit loop. 
Chilli: Bandit. 
Bingo has a blanket out like a parachute.
Bandit: Look at that one! Ha! These kids are nuts! 
Chilli: Well, I know where they get it from. 
The title card appears, with the same basket Chilli was holding.
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Housework. 
It cuts back.
Chilli: You're really doing this?
Bandit: I think I have to. 
Chilli: Ugh. Okay. At least set the rules. What will it take for you to get back to the housework? 
Bandit: Just, you know. One foot in front of the other. I don't think that's too much to ask. 
Bingo walks over, 'normally'. 
Chilli: Okay. Ah! See? that looks good. Boom. Come on.
Bandit: Ah-ah, look at her arms. They're following her legs. 
Chilli: Really? 
Bandit: Yeah. They're meant to go the other way. The opposite of your legs.
Chilli: Oh yeah. Hah! That's crazy! 
Bandit: That's what I'm saying! 
Bluey carries a blanket over her back.
Bluey: Sheets! Oh, sheets! 
Chilli: Okay. That's not even close to her normal walk. 
Bingo walks back, carrying a sheet between her arm. She walks 'normally' once again.
Bandit: Oh, hang on, hang on. Here we go... 
Chilli: Feet okay, arms okay. I think we're good. 
Bingo: Eh... Ee! Backwards! 
BOTH: And there it is. 
Chilli: This is hard. 
Bandit: I'll even settle for the same crazy walk from there to there. But look! 
Bluey does many crazy walks.
Bandit: One, two, three different walks in three meters. 
Chilli: Why do they do it? 
Bandit: Cause they're nuts! 
Bingo: Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. 
Bandit: That's not even a walk! 
Chilli: I'm making a cuppa. We're gonna be here a while. 
It cuts, showing the basket with a spray bottle in it. It then cuts to show Bluey, with a grey blanket over her head pretending to be an elephant.
Bluey: Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Brrr! 
Bandit: Elephant. 
Bingo: Hop. Hop. Hop. 
Bandit: Kangaroo. 
Chilli comes in with a cup.
Chilli: What did I miss? 
Bandit: Chicken. Working our way through the animal kingdom. 
Bingo pretends to be a bird.
Bandit: That's an emu. 
Chilli: Yeah. Or maybe an ostrich? Or a big duck? 
Bluey crawls on all fours.
Bandit: And that's some sort of, uh... uhm.
Bluey: Ee-aw!
Bandit: Donkey! 
Chilli: Some of these look really hard to do. 
Bandit: I know! Don't they get tired? 
Bingo: Bee-oop! Bee-oop! 
Bandit: Woah. We have a winner.
Chilli: Holy Dooley. That's impressive. 
Bandit: How do you even do that? You have to like, have your feet out like a duck... ow! But then pop them in...
Chilli: While spinning. 
Bandit: Oh yeah. While spinning.
He tries to replicate the walk.
Bandit: Ow! My groin! 
Chilli: Haha! 
Bandit: That's funny, is it? 
Chilli: A little. 
Bandit: Well come on, you try it. 
Chilli: Okay. So... feet out.
Bandit: Yeah, but back in on every other step. 
Chilli: Yeah. See? And then you spin. 
Chilli spins and almost falls, but Bandit quickly catches her.
Bandit: See, it's not easy. 
Chilli: I can do this. 
It cuts, the two still trying.
Bandit: Yeah, you got it babe. That's good.
Chilli: How are my feet? 
Bandit: Yeah yeah, their good, babe. Okay, here we go. Spin! 
Bandit spins and gets dizzy.
Bandit: Oh man, dizzy. 
Chilli laughs.
Bingo: Otter. Ot-Otter. Otter. Huh? 
Bingo notices the two.
Chilli: Oh hang on, I think I've got it. 
Bandit: You've gotta go 'Bee-op! Bee-op!'. Oh, your doing it! 
Chilli: Bee-op! Bee-op! 
Bandit: You're not spinning. You've gotta spin. 
Chilli: Oh, yeah. Woah!
The two are heard in the background. Bluey walks over.
Bingo: Bluey, look.
Bluey: Huh? 
Chilli: Bee-op! 
Bandit: Bee-op! 
Chilli: Bee-op! 
Bluey: What are they doing? 
Bingo: I don't know. But it doesn't look like housework. 
Bandit: Bee-op! 
Chilli: Bee-op! 
Bluey: What's going on? 
BOTH: Hey, kids! 
Chilli: Uh, shouldn't you be tidying the blankets up? 
Bluey: Were finished.
Bingo: Shouldn't you be doing housework? 
Bandit: We haven't started. 
Bluey: Why? 
Bandit: Were trying to walk like you guys. 
Bluey: Why? 
Chilli: We don't know! 
Bandit: Yeah. 
Bluey: Hmm... okay. 
Bandit: Can you show us how you do the 'Bee-oop Bee-oop' walk? 
Bingo: Yeah! 
It cuts. Bluey is seen eating grapes while sunlight shines through the window.
Bingo: Okay, you start with your feet out, and then they go in. Out, in. Out, in. 
BOTH: Out, in. Out, in. 
Bingo: Put your bottom out a bit more. Yeah, you got it! 
Bluey: Dad, you need to do duck feet. 
Bandit: Oh yeah, I forgot. 
Bingo: And you have to say 'Bee-oop! Bee-oop!'
ALL: Bee-oop! Bee-oop! Bee-oop! 
Bluey scoots aside for Bingo to sit.
Bingo: Yeah, Mum, you're doing it! Ah! So are you, Dad! 
Bandit: I'm doing it! Woo-hoo! 
BOTH: Bee-oop! Bee-oop! 
Bingo: You got it, you got it! 
Bluey: Go Dad! 
It shows the outside of the Heeler home, the two still doing the walk. It fades to show all four on the rug.
Chilli: Ah. The house is still a mess, none of the vacuuming's done. But, we can both now do the 'bee-oop' walk. 
Bandit: I think I'm okay with that. 
Chilli: Me too. 
Bluey: Well, we finished our chores, so we're going to play.
Chilli: Go for it, girls. Well done.
Bingo: Bye. 
The two walk off normally.
Chilli: Bandit, Bandit. Look. 
Bandit: Huh? What? 
Chilli: Is that okay, is that okay? 
Bandit: Arms swinging, one foot in front of the other... 
Chilli: Are we good, are we good? 
Bandit: Yeah, I think we're good! 
BOTH: Yes! Woo-hoo! 
Bingo: Grown-ups are nuts. 
Chilli: You know what that means. 
Bandit: Yeah, I know. Back to the housework. 
Chilli: Yep. 
Bandit: Let's just get through it. 
Chilli: Then we can relax. 
It shows Bandit vacuuming, Chilli cleaning the window. Bandit slightly does the 'bee-oop' walk. Chilli is seen wiping the window.
Chilli: Bee-oop! Bee-oop! 
The episode ends, Bluey is walking across the screen as a chicken.
