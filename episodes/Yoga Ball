The episode cuts to the Heeler Family household, where Bandit is scrubbing the countertops. Bluey and Bingo enter, giggling.
Bingo: "Can you play games with us?"
Bandit: "No time for games, squirt! I'm working from home today. One sec, I've just gotta pop downstairs."
Bandit presses a pretend button and descends, much to the joy of Bluey and Bingo. Shortly thereafter, Bandit emerges back up.
Bandit: "Okay, I'm back. Is this yours?"
Bandit holds up a sandal picked up from the floor. Bingo takes it and laughs.
Bluey: "Yeah! Play the elevator game!"
Bandit: "I told you, kid. No time for elevator game. It's a work day today!"
Bandit descends once again, getting a joyful reaction from the Heeler sisters. Bandit returns, now with another sandal.
Bandit: "I found another one!"
Bluey & Bingo: "Again!"
Bandit: "Sorry kids, I've got loads of work on! I just can't play the elevator game..."
Bandit descends back down as he's talking.
Bluey & Bingo: "You are playing it!"
TITLE CARD: Yoga Ball
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called Yoga Ball."
The shot cuts to Bandit's computer room, where he sits on a yoga ball whilst typing away on his computer. He prints something off, not noticing Bluey and Bingo.
Bluey: "Now, Bingo!"
Both the sisters run in and roll the yoga ball away while laughing. Once Bandit retrieves the printed paper he goes to sit back down, only to fall down.
Bandit: "Hey!"
The shot cuts to the living room, with Bingo's squealing and Bandit chasing after them.
Bandit: "Don't even think about it! Hey! Hey!"
Bluey: "Push!"
The ball rolls down the stairs and out of the living room.
Bandit: "You little rats!" 
Bandit tickles Bluey and Bingo, and the shot then cuts to Bluey running to grab the yoga ball.
Bluey: "Why do you sit on a giant green ball?"
Bandit: "Cause I wrecked my back changing your nappies!"
Bandit picks up Bluey and bounces her while she is clinging to the ball.
Bingo: "I want a turn doing that!"
Bluey gets off the yoga ball as Bandit picks up Bingo, as he goes to bounce her, almost a little too roughly.
Bandit: "Okay, now beat it, I've gotta get to work."
Bluey seems disappointed by this. Bingo is dizzy.
Bingo: "Oooohh..."
Bluey: "No, not yet!" 
Bluey & Bingo run off again, rolling the ball with them.
Bandit: "Bluey!"
The shot transitions to the sisters' bedroom, where the yoga ball is tucked in bed wearing a purple hat and Bluey is reading a book to it. Bingo is looking at a pack of stickers.
Bluey: "So, then Mixed Up Murphy said "would smoothie banana you like?" Oh Bally, you need to sleep! You must be so tired. That big daddy's been sitting on you all day."
Bingo: "Uh, Bally? Which tattoo should I get? Do you like the unicorn, or...or the rainbows?"
Bluey : "Well, Bingo..."
Bingo: "My name is Larn."
Bluey : "Well, Larn, I really think you should get--"
Suddenly, Bandit.
Bandit: "There he is!" 
Bluey and Bingo squeal, playtime now over. The shot goes back to Bandit's room. Bluey laughs and runs in, sitting in Bandit's office chair and spinning in circles.
Bandit: "Out..." 
Bluey: "Can we play delivery chair?"
Bandit: "No."
Bluey: "Aw, pleaaase?!"
Bluey does a pitiful please face, with stars in her eyes as she looks up at Bandit.
Bandit: "Oh, don't use your please face! Alright..."
Bluey: "Yeah, Bingo! Delivery chair!"
Bingo squeals and goes to sit beside Bluey on the office chair.
Bandit: "That please face gets me every time."
The shot cuts to the hallway, where Bandit, Bluey and Bingo walk through. Bandit is pushing the chair while focused on a clipboard.
Bandit: "Now I need to get these two packages delivered. But first I need to stamp them! Stamp! Stamp!"
Bandit lightly pokes Bluey and Bingo, but for Bingo it was almost a little too rough.
Bingo: "Oooh..."
Bingo frowns and puts her paws to her stomach. The shot then cuts to Bandit and Chilli's bedroom. Bandit stops moving the chair once at the arrived destination; the bed.
Bandit: "Okay, now I need to deliver these to, hm, let's see...Ah, Mogadishu! I better be careful, then!"
Bandit throws Bluey onto the bed, much to her joy. Bingo happily scoots to the front of the chair, ready to be picked up.
Bandit: "Here's the second package!"
Bandit throws Bingo...a little too rough. She lands nose-first on the bed.
Bandit: "Okay, delivery over. Now I've gotta get back to work!"
Bluey chases after Bandit, while leaving Bingo on the bed.
Bluey: "Aw, come on! One more!"
Bandit: "No!"
Bingo: "Awww..."
The shot cuts back to the living room, where Bandit is heading up the stairs, with Bluey and Bingo chasing after him.
Bluey: "Can we just quickly play that game where we run down the hall, and you say na-na-na-na! And you roll the ball down the hall, and we jump out of the way!"
Bandit: "Oh, you mean Raiders!"
Bingo: "Yeah, Raiders!"
Bluey: "Yeah, Raiders."
Bandit: "Alright. Maybe a QUICK game!"
Bluey: "Hooray!"
Bingo: "Not too quick though. I want you to play for...this long!"
Bandit: "Okay, fair enough.
Bluey & Bingo: "Hooray!"
The shot cuts to a ladybug landing on a plant on the windowsill. Then the shot goes back to the trio, the sisters giggling in anticipation for the game to start.
Bandit: "You ready?"
Bluey & Bingo: "Yes!"
Bandit: "Okay....GO!"
Bandit rolls the ball down the hallway. It catches up to the sisters as they squeal and continue running away from it. They dive into an open room as they successfully escape from the yoga ball. The two hop out shortly thereafter.
Bluey: "Again!"
The shot transitions to the start of the hallway, with Bandit readying up another round. Once more in the pursuit, the two dive into the same open room, with the music beginning to swell.
Bluey: "Again!"
Bandit rolls the ball, but Bluey prematurely takes off before Bingo, giving Bluey a head-start as she dives into the room. Unfortunately this leaves Bingo running alone. The ball catches up to her in no time. As she continues to run she ends up getting ran over by the ball, being sent to the ground.
Bandit: "Okay, game over. I have to do some work!"
Bandit picks Bingo up, who is beginning to look worn out and saddened.
Bandit: "Walk it off, sport!" 
Bingo looks to the camera, a drained look in her eyes. She sighs, and the shot transitions to her walking down the stairs slowly in sadness. Now outside, the red heeler pup goes to cower underneath the tree bench, tears welling up in her eyes. Just then, a ball rolls past. Chilli enters!"
Chilli: "Hey Bingo!"
Bingo's tail wags, as she comes out from underneath the bench.
Chilli: "Oh, what's the matter?"
Bingo: "Daddy's playing too rough with me."
Chilli kneels down to comfort Bingo.
Chilli: "Yeah, he does play too rough sometimes, doesn't he?"
Bingo: "Yes.."
Chilli: "Did you use your big girl bark?"
Bingo: "No. Because I don't have a very good big girl bark."
Chilli: "Really? Show me!"
Bingo does a small bark.
Chilli: "Oh, that's alright! Just do it bigger!"
Bingo does another bark, this time louder.
Chilli: "Bigger!"
Bingo does a third bark, this time much louder than the previous attempts.
Chilli: "Whoa! There it is! Come on, let's go talk to your dad."
As the two exit, Bingo does her perfected big girl bark once more. The shot transitions to Bandit working in his room.
Bandit: "Go awaaaayy!"
Bluey, Bingo and Chilli enter. Bluey grins while Bingo has a saddened look to her.
Bandit: "What's up?"
Bluey: "You're in trouble!"
Chilli: "No one's in trouble. Bingo just has something she'd like to tell dad. That's all!"
Bingo walks up to Bandit.
Bingo: "Sometimes you play a bit too rough with me."
Bandit kneels down to comfort Bingo.
Bandit: "Oh, Bingo, really?"
Bingo nods.
Bandit: "Oh, sorry buster, I didn't realize! I think I just forget that you're a bit younger than your sister."
Bingo: "I'm only four."
Bluey: "Yeah, not six like me!"
Chilli: "But Dad, we don't want you to stop playing with us."
Bandit: "Oh, okay!"
Bingo: "I just need to get better at using my big girl bark."
Bandit: "Okay, well let's practice!" 
Bingo: "Okay!"
Bandit picks Bingo up, walking over to the yoga ball.
Bandit: "So tell me, is this rough okay? Boing!"
Bingo: "Yes, that's okay!"
Bandit: "Okay, how about this rough? Boing!" 
Bingo: "Yes, that's okay!"
Bandit: "Okay, what about THIS! BOING!"
Bingo does her big girl bark.
Bandit: "Okay, too rough! Now I know! Alright, now clear out, you lot! I've got to- hey, where's my ball?"
Bluey : "I'll just be a second!"
The shot cuts to the bathroom, where Bandit opens the door, and the trio are surely surprised.
Bluey : "Oh, how rude! Can't you see that I'm on the toilet?"
Bluey laughs.
