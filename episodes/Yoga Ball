The episode opens with a brief view of the Heeler house before cutting to the kitchen, where Bandit is scrubbing the countertop. Bluey and Bingo run in from outside, giggling.
Bingo: Can you play games with us?
Bandit: No time for games, squirt! I'm working from home today. One sec, I've just gotta pop downstairs. Doot!
Bandit presses a pretend button and slowly descends like an elevator, much to the joy of Bluey and Bingo, who laugh. Shortly thereafter, Bandit emerges back up.
Bandit: Okay, I'm back. Is this yours?
Bandit holds up a sandal picked up from the floor. Bingo takes it and squeals.
Bluey: Yeah! Play the elevator game!
Bandit: I told you, kid. No time for elevator game. It's a work day today! Doot!
Bandit mines pressing the elevator button and descends once again, getting a joyful reaction from the Heeler sisters. Bandit returns, now with another sandal.
Bandit: I found another one!
Bluey and Bingo: Again!
Bandit: Sorry kids, I've got loads of work on! Doot!
Bandit once again presses the pretend button and descends back down as he's talking, making Bingo and Bluey laugh.
Bandit: I just can't play the elevator game!
Bluey and Bingo: You are playing it!
TITLE CARD: Yoga Ball
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called Yoga Ball.
Cut to the study, where Bandit sits on a yoga ball whilst typing away on his laptop, not noticing Bluey and Bingo as they peer through the doorway. Bingo giggles. Bandit prints something off and walks over to the printer.
Bluey: Now, Bingo!
Both the sisters run in and roll the yoga ball out of the study while laughing. Once Bandit retrieves the printed paper, he goes to sit back down, only to fall onto the floor.
Bandit: Oof! Hey!
The shot cuts to the living room. Bluey and Bingo squeal as they roll the ball to the top of the stairs, while Bandit chases after them.
Bandit: Don't even think about it! Hey! Hey!
Bluey: Push!
The ball bounces down the stairs, over the couch and out of the living room.
Bandit: You little rats! 
Bandit playfully tickles Bluey and Bingo, making them laugh. The scene cuts to outside the living room. Bluey runs out and grabs the yoga ball.
Bluey: Why do you sit on a giant green ball?
Bandit picks up Bluey.
Bandit: 'Cause I wrecked my back changing YOUR nappies!
He starts bouncing Bluey while she clings to the ball and laughs.
Bandit: Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing!
Bingo: I want a turn doing that!
Bandit puts Bluey down, picks up Bingo, and starts bouncing her off the ball. She stops smiling.
Bandit: Boing, boing...
Cut to a close up of Bingo being bounced, slightly too roughly.
Bandit: Boing! Boing! Boing! Boing! Boing!
Cut back to the previous wide shot. Bandit puts Bingo down, who looks dizzy.
Bandit: Okay, now beat it, I've gotta get to work.
Bluey seems disappointed by this. Cut to a close up of Bingo, slowly wobbling on the spot.
Bingo: Oooohh...
Cut back to the previous wide shot.
Bluey: No, not yet! 
Bluey rolls the ball away before Bandit can pick it up. Bingo runs after her as they giggle.
Bandit: Bluey!
The shot transitions to the sisters' bedroom, where the yoga ball is tucked in bed, wearing a large purple hat. Bluey is reading a book to it. Bingo is looking at a pack of stickers.
Bluey: So, then Mixed Up Murphy said "Would smoothie banana you like?" (she giggles) Oh Bally, you need to sleep! You must be so tired. That big daddy's been sitting on you all day.
Bingo: Uh, Bally? Which tattoo should I get? Do you like the unicorn, or... or the rainbows?
Bluey : Well, Bingo...
Bingo: My name is Larn.
Bluey : Well, Larn, I really think you should get--
Suddenly, Bandit enters, surprising the kids.
Bandit: There it is! 
Bluey and Bingo squeal, playtime now over. The shot goes back to Bandit's room. Bluey laughs and runs in, jumps into Bandit's office chair and spins in circles.
Bandit: (pointing towards the door) Out... 
Bluey: Can we play delivery chair?
Bandit: No.
Bluey: Aw, pleaaase?!
Bluey does a pitiful please face, with stars in her giant pupils as she looks up at Bandit.
Bandit: Oh, don't use your please face! Aw, alright...
Bluey: Yeah, Bingo! Delivery chair!
Bingo enters, squeals, and goes to sit beside Bluey on the office chair.
Bandit: That please face gets me every time.
The shot cuts to the hallway. Bandit pushes the chair with the kids sitting on it while focused on a clipboard.
Bandit: Now I need to get these two packages delivered. But first I need to stamp them! Stamp, STAMP!
Bandit lightly thumps Bluey in the chest, then does the same with Bingo, but a little too rough for her. Close up of Bingo.
Bingo: Oooh...
Bingo frowns and puts her paws to her stomach. The shot then cuts to Bandit and Chilli's bedroom. Bandit pushes the chair in front of the bed.
Bandit: Okay, now I need to deliver these to, hm, let's see... Ah, Mogadishu! Okay, here's one package.
Bandit picks up a laughing Bluey.
Bandit:Ah, marked fragile. Okay, well, I better be CAREFUL, then!
Bandit throws Bluey onto the bed, much to her joy. Bingo happily scoots to the front of the chair, ready to be picked up.
Bandit: Here's the second package!
Bandit throws Bingo up in the air. Cut to a close up of Bingo flying through the air, looking scared. Cut back to the previous wide shot as she lands nose-first on the bed.
Bingo: Oof!
Bandit: Okay, delivery over. Now I've gotta get back to work!
Bluey chases after Bandit as he leaves, while leaving Bingo on the bed.
Bluey: Aw, come on! One more!
Cut to a close up of Bingo, lying stunned on the bed.
Bandit: No!
Bingo: Ooooh...
The shot cuts back to the living room, where Bandit is heading up the stairs, with Bluey and Bingo chasing after him.
Bluey: Can we just quickly play that game where we run down the hall, and you sing ♫ "Da-na-na-na!" ♫ And you roll the ball down the hall, and we jump out of the way!
Bandit: Oh, you mean Raiders!
Bingo: Yeah, Raiders!
Bluey: Yeah, Raiders.
Bandit: Alright. Maybe a QUICK game!
Bluey: Hooray!
Bingo: Not too quick though. I want you to play for... (holds her arms out) this long!
Bandit: Okay, fair enough.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
The shot cuts to a ladybug landing on a plant on the windowsill. Then the shot goes back to the trio in the hallway. Bandit is holding the yoga ball and the sisters giggling in anticipation for the game to start.
Bandit: You ready?
Bluey and Bingo: Yes!
Bandit: Okay... GO!
Bandit rolls the ball down the hallway. It catches up to the sisters as they squeal and continue running away from it. They dive into an open room as they successfully escape from the yoga ball. The two run out shortly thereafter.
Bluey: Again!
The shot fades to the start of the hallway, with Bandit readying up another round. Once more in the pursuit, the two dive into the same open room, with the music beginning to swell. They come back out.
Bluey: Again!
Bandit rolls the ball, but Bluey starts running before Bingo, giving Bluey a head-start as she dives into the room. The ball catches up with Bingo as she continues to run and it runs her over, sending her to the ground.
Bingo: Oof! Ooh...
Cut to Bingo lying on the floor. She rolls onto her back, stunned, as Bandit walks in.
Bandit: Okay, game over. I have to do some work!
Bandit picks Bingo up, not noticing that she looks worn out and saddened. He casually rubs her head before walking off.
Bandit: Walk it off, sport! 
Bingo looks to the camera, a drained look in her eyes. She quietly sighs. Cut to Bingo slowly walking down the stairs in sadness. Cut to outside, as the red heeler pup goes to cower underneath the tree bench, tears welling up in her eyes. Just then, there's a whack and a hockey ball bounces into view. Chilli enters with a hockey stick and sees Bingo.
Chilli: Hey Bingo!
Bingo's tail wags slightly, and she comes out from underneath the bench, still looking sad.
Chilli: Oh, what's the matter?
Bingo: Daddy's playing too rough with me.
Chilli kneels down to comfort Bingo.
Chilli: Yeah, he DOES play too rough sometimes, doesn't he?
Bingo: Yes..
Chilli: Did you use your big girl bark?
Bingo: No. Because I don't have a very good big girl bark.
Chilli: Really? Show me!
Bingo: Wuff.
Chilli: Oh, that's alright! Just do it bigger!
Bingo: Wuff!
Chilli: Bigger!
Bingo: WUFF!
Bingo starts to look happier.
Chilli: Whoa! There it is! Come on, let's go talk to your dad.
Chilli and Bingo walk towards the house.
Bingo: WUFF!
The shot transitions to Bandit working in his study. There is a knock at the door.
Bandit: (playfully) Go awaaaayy!
Bluey, Bingo and Chilli enter. Bluey grins while Bingo has a saddened look to her.
Bandit: What's up?
Bluey: (pointing at Bandit, teasing) You're in trouble!
Chilli: No one's in trouble. Bingo just has something she'd like to tell dad. That's all!
Bingo walks up to Bandit.
Bingo: Sometimes you play a bit too rough with me.
Bandit kneels down to comfort Bingo.
Bandit: Oh, Bingo, really?
Bingo nods.
Bandit: Oh, sorry buster, I didn't realize! I think I just forget that you're a bit younger than your sister.
Bingo: I'm only four.
Bluey: Yeah, not six like me!
Chilli: But Dad, we don't want you to stop playing with us.
Bandit: Oh, okay!
Bingo: I'm just gonna better... at using my big girl bark.
Bandit: Okay, well, let's practice! 
Bingo: Okay!
Bandit picks Bingo up and carries her over to the yoga ball.
Bandit: So tell me, is this rough okay?
Bandit gently bounces Bingo off the ball.
Bandit: Boing...
Bingo: Yes, that's okay!
Bandit: Okay, how about this rough?
Bandit bounces Bingo off the ball again, but this time, more roughly.
Bandit: Boing! 
Bingo: Yes, that's okay!
Bandit: Okay, what about THIS!
Bandit bounces Bingo off the ball again, but this time, too roughly.
Bandit: BOING!
Bingo: WUFF!
Cut to a close up of Bandit cuddling Bingo.
Bandit: Okay, too rough! Now I know!
Cut to the wide shot of the office. Bluey and the ball have disappeared. Bandit puts Bingo down, who runs over to Chilli for a hug.
Bandit: Alright, now clear out, you lot! I've got to...
Bandit reaches over to where the ball was, only to notice that it's gone.
Bandit: Hey! Where's my ball?
Bluey : (offscreen) I'll just be a second!
The toilet being flushed is heard. The shot cuts to the toilet, where Bandit opens the door and he, Chilli, and Bingo look inside. Bandit and Chilli then appear surprised, while Bingo is delighted at what she sees: Bluey has placed the ball, now wearing the large purple hat from earlier and some of Bingo's stickers, on the toilet.
Bluey : Oh, my! How rude! Can't you see that I'm on the toilet?
Bluey laughs.
