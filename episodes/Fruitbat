The episode opens with Bluey, Bandit, Bingo and Chilli playing Pop Up Croc in their living room. It is Bluey's turn, and she carefully puts a crocodile into one of the bowl's sides as her family anxiously watch on.
Bluey: "Ehh... easy..."
Bingo: "Eh, Bluey, be safe!"
Bluey puts her crocodile into the bowl's side, but the person pops up when she does so, shocking the family.
All: "Aah!"
Everyone except for Bluey laughs.
Bluey: "Aww, not fair!"
Bandit: "How good's Pop Up Croc?"
Bluey puts the person back into the bowl.
Bluey: "Again!"
Chilli: "No, upstairs for bedtime."
Bluey immediately runs outside, yelling. Bingo follows her, giggling.
Bandit: "Oh, here we go."
Bluey runs outside, still yelling, as fruit bats fly off into the night. Bluey and Bingo stop and watch them.
Bluey, Bingo: "Ooh!"
TITLE CARD - Fruitbat
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Fruitbat!"
Bandit walks outside to the kids, holding a rugby ball.
Bandit: "Alright, say goodnight to the animals. Goodnight, frogs!"
Bingo: "Night, kangaroos. Night, bilbies."
Bandit: "Night, fruit bats!"
Bingo: "No, not night fruit bats. They don't sleep at night. They're 'octurnal."
Bandit: "Good knowledge, kid."
Bluey: "You mean fruit bats don't need to go to bed now?"
Bandit: "No."
He kicks the ball off into the yard.
Bandit: "But you do. Come on, bedtime."
Bandit and Bingo go to walk back inside.
Bluey: "I wish I was a fruit bat."
Bandit: "Well, fruit bats don't get to do rocket ship."
Bluey. Bingo: "Yeah, rocket ship!"
Bluey and Bingo run inside the house. Cut to Bandit holding Bluey and Bingo at the bottom of the stairs as a part of playing rocket ship.
Bingo: "Okay, helmets."
Bluey and Bingo mime putting on helmets as Bluey makes a putting-on-helmet sound.
Bluey: "Seatbelts!"
They mime putting on seatbelts.
Bluey, Bingo: "Click!"
Bingo: "Close the door."
They both mime closing the door.
Bluey: "Clunk."
Bingo : "Click."
Bluey: "Okay, push the button!"
They both mime pushing a button on Bandit's chest.
Bluey, Bingo: "Boop!"
Bandit mimics the noise of a rocket taking off. He runs up the stairs, carrying Bluey and Bingo. He stops outside the bathroom.
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bandit: "Okay, shower time."
Bandit lets Bingo down and she runs into the bathroom, but Bluey clings tightly to him.
Bluey: "No, more rocket ship! I don't need a shower."
Bandit: "Yeah, you do, ya grub."
He taps Bluey's nose, then holds her up and sniffs. He recoils.
Bandit: "Poahh!"
He puts Bluey down.
Bluey: "Not fair. I bet fruit bats don't have to have showers."
Bandit: "Well, then they wouldn't get to play penguins."
Bluey: "Yeah, penguins!"
Bluey runs into the bathroom.
(Note: The scene that follows is cut from international versions of the episode due to the penguin game - which involves Bluey sliding on water on the bathroom floor - being considered too dangerous for kids.)
Bluey takes a mug and pours water on the floor. She then slides around on the floor like a penguin while Bingo is showering with an umbrella and wiping her hand on the misted glass.
Bluey: "Whee!"
Chilli walks in.
Chilli: "Teeth time."
Bluey: "Mum! Look, I'm a penguin!"
Bluey slides around some more.
Bluey: "Whee!"
Chilli: "Oh, whackadoo!"
Later, Bingo is on the toilet while reading a book.
Bingo: "Even though I don't really need to do a wee, I'm going to do one anyway, otherwise I might wet the bed."
Bandit is just outside the toilet, drying Bluey while she is brushing her teeth.
Bandit: "That's very clever, Bingo."
Bingo: "It's called a tactical wee."
Bluey: "Not fair. I wanna stay up like the fruit bat."
Bandit: "Well, when the fruit bats go to the toilet, they do it hanging upside down, so the wee just runs all over them!"
Bandit tickles Bluey.
Bandit, Bluey, Bingo: "Blech!"
Bluey: "I'd love that!
Bandit: "I bet you would, you little grub!
Later, in the kids' bedroom, Bluey is jumping on her bed and flapping her arms like a fruit bat. Chilli is brushing Bingo's fur on the other bed.
Bluey: "Eee! Eee!"
Bluey lands on the floor as Bandit comes in with a book.
Bandit: "Come on, that's a daytime game."
Bluey: "Aww, I just wanna be a fruit bat."
Bandit: "Yeah, yeah, I know. But fruit bats don't get to play the story game, where I tell a story but pretend to fall asleep."
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!
Cut to Bandit in Bluey's bed, reading a story to Bluey and Bingo, who are lying either side of him.
Bandit: "So, the little puppy peeked in the window, and on the table was the most beautiful—"
Bandit pretends to fall asleep, snoring. Bingo and Bluey giggle, then shake him awake.
Bluey, 'Bingo: "Wake up!"
Bandit: "Huh? What? What? Oh, sorry. I think I must have just dozed off. Now, where was I? Oh yeah... the most beautiful golden egg she'd ever seen. So she climbed inside, but out jumped a huge, hairy—"
Bandit pretends to fall asleep again, snoring. Bingo and Bluey giggle.
Bluey, Bingo: "Wake up!"
Bandit snorts and looks around frantically.
Bandit: "Spider!"
Bingo and Bluey giggle more. Later, Bandit and Chilli are saying goodnight to the kids. Chilli kisses Bingo.
Bluey: "Aww, I'm not tired."
Chilli: "I know. Just try, okay?"
Bluey: "It's not fair."
Chilli: "Night, Bluey."
Bluey tries going to sleep, but she can't. She groans and wriggles and kicks the bedsheets off her.
Bluey: "Ugh! I can't fall asleep! Psst, Bingo, are you awake?"
Cut to Bingo, fast asleep with limbs splayed out, and her pillow and blanket thrown aside.
Bluey: "Hmmph!"
In the living room, Bandit is fast asleep on the floor with the rugby ball. Chilli is putting tape on her hockey stick when she hears the stairs creak. She looks up and sees Bluey on top of the staircase.
Chilli: "Bluey!"
Bluey walks down to Chilli.
Chilli: "What am I gonna do with you, hey?"
Bluey: "Let me stay up?"
Chilli: "Ehh..."
Bluey sees Bandit, who starts moving around while in his sleep, grappling with the ball. Bluey giggles.
Bluey: "What's Dad doing?"
Chilli: "Hmm. I'd say he's dreaming about playing touch football with his mates."
Bluey: "Really?"
Chilli: "Yeah. He doesn't get to play that much anymore, so he keeps having dreams about it."
Bluey: "Why doesn't he get to play it for real life?"
Chilli: "Well, he's busy, sweetheart. Busy working and looking after you two."
Bluey: "Oh."
Bandit puts the ball down and starts cheering in his sleep.
Bluey: "Oh, look! Did he just score a try?"
Chilli: "I think he did."
Bluey giggles, then has an idea.
Bluey: "Ooh, maybe I can dream about being a fruit bat."
Chilli: "Well, you could give it a go."
Bluey runs back up the stairs to her bedroom.
Bluey: "Night, Mum!"
Chilli: "Oh. Okay. Night, honey."
Later, Bluey is back in her bed, still trying to fall asleep.
Bluey: "Come on! Come on! Urggh! Dream about being a fruit bat!"
Bluey opens her eyes to find out she's still awake, and groans in annoyance. In the living room, Chilli is putting a huge crocodile in a ten-foot-tall Pop-Up Croc boat as Bluey walks down the stairs.
Bluey: "It didn't work."
Chilli: "Oh well, you tried."
Bluey: "Where'd Dad go?"
Chilli: "He's outside."
Bluey heads out onto the verandah.
Bluey: "Dad!"
Bluey looks up at the sky, then starts flapping her arms like wings and flies up to join some fruit bats in the night sky.
Bluey: "Dad! Dad!"
Bluey flies through the suburb, past Mackenzie's house where he is sleeping in his bed, then lands in a mango tree and hangs upside down on the branches while eating one. She does the same with a papaya tree, a banana tree, and a guava tree. She burps, then hears Bandit's voice.
Bandit: (offscreen) "Mine!"
Bluey flies over to see Bandit playing touch football with Rocky, Stripe, Pat, Mackenzies Dad, and another dog - just as Chilli told her earlier. She hangs upside down on some stadium lights and watches Bandit play.
Pat: (offscreen) "Bandit!"
Bandit: "Yes mate, yes mate, yes mate!"
Mackenzie's Dad: (offscreen) "Kick it!"
Pat: (offscreen) "Right, run!"
Rocko: (offscreen) "Whoa!"
Bandit scores a try and celebrates.
All: "Yeah!"
Bluey calls to Bandit from the light.
Bluey: "Hey, Dad!"
Bandit: "Hey, Bluey! You're a fruit bat!"
Bluey: "Yeah!"
Bandit: "How is it?"
Bluey: "It's great! You get to eat a lot of fruit!"
Bandit: "Ha! I bet! Hey, did you see my try?"
Bluey: "Yeah, I did!"
Bandit: "How good was it!"
Bluey: "So good."
Bandit turns to Pat and Mackenzie's Dad.
Bandit: "There's plenty more where that came from!"
Mackenzie's Dad elbows Bandit playfully as Pat throws the ball over to Bandit.
Mackenzie's Dad: "Ha ha, ya reckon?"
Pat: "Yeah, sure."
Bandit: "Yeah, I do!
Bandit elbows Mackenzie's Dad back. Pat laughs.
Mackenzie's Dad: "Oh, righto."
Pat and Mackenzie's Dad walk off.
Bandit: "Alright, see ya Bluey."
He runs after his mates.
Bandit: "Come on, let's do this!"
Bluey: "See ya, Dad!"
Bluey flies off, upwards and in front of the moon. One of the clouds then transitions back to Bluey's bed, where it is now the next morning. Bluey wakes up.
Bluey: "Wooow!"
In the kitchen, Bandit is doing sit-ups while Chilli and Bingo are having fruit salad. Bluey walks in.
Bluey: "Hi!"
Chilli: "7 o'clock? That was a big sleep."
Bluey: "I had the most amazing dream."
Bandit picks up Bluey and starts bench pressing her.
Bandit: "One, two, three..."
Bluey: "Dad?"
Bandit: "...four, five, six... Yes, mate? ...seven..."
Bluey: "Thanks for looking after us.
Bandit: "...eight, nine, ten!"
Bandit puts Bluey down on him and touches her nose.
Bandit: You're welcome."
Bluey giggles.
Chilli: "I've got your favourite, Bluey. Fruit salad!"
Bluey: "Yuck! No more fruit. Just some toast, please."
Chilli and Bingo are surprised with Bluey's response. They look at each other.
Bingo: (in the cadence of "I don't know") "Hm-hmm-hm."
The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a piano-based tune with vocals. Bluey is dancing.
