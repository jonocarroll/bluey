Script
Bluey, Bandit, Chilli and Bingo are playing Pop Up Croc. It is Bluey's turn to put a crocodile into one of the sides of the bowl.
Bluey: Eh...easy.
Bingo: Oh, Bluey, be safe!
Bluey puts her crocodile into the side of the bowl, but the person pops up when she does so. 
Bluey: Ah!
Everyone laughs except for Bluey.
Bluey: Oh, not fair!
Bandit: How good's Pop Up Croc?
Bluey puts the person back into the bowl.
Bluey: Again!
Chilli: No, upstairs for bedtime.
Bluey yells and runs outside with Bingo following her.
Bandit: Ah, here we go.
Bluey: NO!
Bluey yells when she is outside. Bluey and Bingo see some fruit bats flying in the night sky.
Bluey and Bingo: Ooh!
TITLE CARD.
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Fruit Bat.
Bandit: Alright, say goodnight to the animals. Goodnight, frogs.
Bingo: Night, kangaroos. Night, bilbies.
Bandit. Night, fruit bats.
Bingo: No, not night fruit bats. They don't sleep at night. They're "octurnal". (nocturnal)
Bandit: Good knowledge, kid.
Bluey: You mean fruit bats don't need to go to bed now?
Bandit: No, but you do. Come on, bedtime.
Bluey: I wish I was a fruit bat.
Bandit: Well, fruit bats don't get to play rocket ship.
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah, rocket ship!
Bluey and Bingo run inside the house. At the bottom of the stairs, Bandit is holding Bluey and Bingo while playing rocket ship.
Bingo: OK, helmets.
Bluey: Seatbelts!
Bluey and Bingo: Click!
Bingo: Close the door.
Bluey and Bingo: Clunk. Click.
Bluey: OK, push the button!
Bluey and Bingo: Boop!
Bluey and Bingo push the button and Bandit mimics the noise of a rocket taking off, running up the stairs and taking Bluey and Bingo with them to the bathroom. Bandit lands the rocket ship outside the bathroom.
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!
Bandit: OK, shower time.
Bluey: No, more rocket ship! I don't need a shower.
Bandit: Yeah, you do, ya grub. (Bandit sniffs Bluey and gets disgusted by the smell.) Poahh!
Bluey: Not fair. I bet fruit bats don't have to have showers.
Bandit: Well, then they wouldn't get to play penguins.
Bluey: Yeah, penguins!
Bluey runs into the bathroom. 
(Note: The next scene that follows is cut from international versions of the episode due to the penguin game - which involves Bluey sliding on water on the bathroom floor - being too dangerous for kids to learn. So I have added in the dialogue for those who do not get the chance to watch the scene in the international versions of the episode.)
[[Bluey takes a mug and pours water on the floor. She then slides around on the floor like a penguin while Bingo is having a shower and exhaling her breath on the glass.
Bluey: Whee!
Chilli comes in.
Chilli: Teeth time.
Bluey: Mum, look, I'm a penguin!
Bluey slides around on the floor.
Bluey: Whee!
Chilli: Oh, whackadu!]]
Bingo is on the toilet while reading her book.
Bingo: Even though I don't really need to do a wee, I'm going to do one anyway, otherwise, I might wet the bed.
Bandit is drying Bluey while she is brushing her teeth.
Bandit: That's very clever, Bingo.
Bingo: It's called a tactical wee.
Bluey: Not fair. I wanna stay up like the fruit bats.
Bandit: Well, when the fruit bats go to the toilet, they do it hanging upside down. So, the wee just runs all over them. (Bandit tickles Bluey) Blech!
Bluey: Ugh! I'd love that!
Bandit: I bet you would, you little grub!
In her bedroom, Bluey is jumping on her bed, flapping her arms like a fruit bat. 
Bluey: Whee! Whee!
Bluey lands on the floor when Bandit comes in with a book.
Bandit: Come on, that's a daytime game.
Bluey: Aw, I just wanna stay up like a fruit bat.
Bandit: Yeah, yeah, I know. But fruit bats don't get to play the story game, where I tell a story but pretend to fall asleep.
Bingo and Bluey: Yeah!
Bandit is in Bluey's bed reading a story to Bingo and Bluey.
Bandit: So, the little puppy peeked in the window, and on the table was the most beautiful... (Bandit falls asleep snoring, Bingo and Bluey giggle)
Bingo and Bluey: Wake up!
Bandit: Huh? What? What? Oh, sorry. I think I must have just dozed off. Now, where was I? Oh yeah. (continues reading the story) ...the most beautiful golden egg she'd ever seen. So she climbed inside, but out jumped a huge hairy... (Bandit falls asleep snoring again, Bingo and Bluey giggle)
Bingo and Bluey: Wake up!
Bandit: Spider!
Bingo and Bluey laugh. Later, Bandit and Chilli are saying goodnight to Bingo and Bluey. Chilli kisses Bingo.
Bluey: Aw! I'm not tired.
Chilli: I know. Just try, OK?
Bluey: It's not fair.
Chilli: Goodnight, Bluey.
Bluey tries going to sleep, but she has trouble doing so, groaning and she kicks the bedsheets off of her.
Bluey: I can't fall asleep! Psst, Bingo, are you awake?
Bingo is fast asleep, but with her tongue hanging out and no bedsheets on her.
Bluey: Humph!
In the lounge, Bandit is on the floor fast asleep with a football next to him. Chilli is putting sticky tape on her hockey stick when she hears the stairs creaking. She looks up and sees Bluey on top of the staircase.
Chilli: Bluey! What am I gonna do with you, hey?
Bluey: Let me stay up?
Chilli: Ehh...
Bluey sees Bandit asleep holding a football, who then starts moving around while in his sleep. Bluey giggles at this.
Bluey: What's Dad doing?
Chilli: Hmm, I'd say he's dreaming about playing touch football with his mates.
Bluey: Really?
Chilli: Yeah, he doesn't get to play that much anymore, so he keeps having dreams about it.
Bluey: Why doesn't he get to play it for real life?
Chilli: Well, he's busy, sweetheart. Busy working and looking after you two.
Bluey: Oh.
Bandit puts the football down and starts cheering in his sleep.
Bluey: Oh, look! Did he just score a try?
Chilli: I say he did.
Bluey giggles.
Bluey: Ooh, maybe I can dream about being a fruit bat.
Chilli: Well, you could give it a go.
Bluey runs up the stairs to her bedroom.
Bluey: Night, Mum!
Chilli: Oh. OK. Night, honey.
Bluey is asleep in her bed.
Bluey: Come on! Come on! (Groans) Dream about being a fruit bat!
Bluey opens her eyes and finds out that she is still awake. This groans in annoyance.
The next scene shows Chilli putting a big crocodile in a big Pop Up Croc bowl in the lounge when Bluey show up. This confirms that Bluey is dreaming.
Bluey: It didn't work.
Chilli: Oh well, you tried.
Bluey: Where'd Dad go?
Chilli: He's outside.
Bluey heads outside.
Bluey: Dad!
Bluey then starts flapping her arms like they are wings and joins some fruit bats in the night sky.
Bluey: Dad! Dad!
Bluey flies past Mackenzie's house where he is sleeping in his bed, then Bluey goes to various trees and hangs upside down on the tree branches while eating lots of fruit. This ranges from mangoes, rockmelons, bananas and lemons. She belches. Then she hears Bandit's voice.
Bandit: Mine!
Bluey flies over to where Bandit is. He is playing touch football with his mates, just as Chilli told Bluey earlier. Bluey hangs upside down on some stadium lights and sees Bandit score his try.
Dog: Bandit!
Bandit: Yes, mate, yes mate, yes mate! Kick it! Right, run! Whoa!
Bandit touches the football on the ground where the goal is and celebrates.
Everyone: Yeah!
Bluey: Hey, Dad!
Bandit: Hey, Bluey! You're a fruit bat!
Bluey: Yeah!
Bandit: How is it?
Bluey: It's great! You get to eat a lot of fruit!
Bandit: Ha! I bet! Hey, did you see my try?
Bluey: Yeah, I did!
Bandit: How good was it!
Bluey: So good.
Bandit: There's plenty more where that came from!
Mackenzie's Dad: Yeah! Sure!
Lucky's Dad: Ya reckon?
Bandit: Yeah, I do!
Mackenzie's Dad: Oh, righto!
Bandit: Alright, see ya Bluey. Come on, let's do this!
Bluey: See ya, Dad!
Bluey flies upwards to the moon. One of the clouds then transitions to Bluey's bedroom where Bluey is in bed. It is the next day in the morning. Bluey wakes up.
Bluey: Wow!
In the kitchen, Bandit is doing sit ups, while Chilli and Bingo are having fruit salad when Bluey walks in.
Bluey: Hi!
Chilli: 7 o'clock? That was a big sleep!
Bluey: I had the most amazing dream.
Bandit picks up Bluey and uses her as a warm up for his arms.
Bandit: One, two, three,
Bluey: Dad?
Bandit: four, five, six... Yes mate? ...seven,
Bluey: Thanks for looking after us.
Bandit: eight, nine, ten! (Bandit puts Bluey down on him and touches Bluey's nose.) You're welcome.
Bluey giggles.
Chilli: I've got your favourite, Bluey. Fruit salad!
Bluey: Yuck! No more fruit. Just some toast, please.
Chilli is surprised with Bluey's response. Bingo shrugs her shoulders.
End Credits.
