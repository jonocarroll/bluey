Bluey: Do dee, do do do, do do do do. There.

Bluey: Bingo, check it out! I'm building a house. 
Bluey: I've got a bookshelf, and a reading area.
Bingo: Oooh! I'll build one too.
Bluey: Yeah, we can be Neighbours! 
Bingo: Yeah! Neighbors!
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Neighbours. 
Bingo: Dee do do do, dee do There!
Chilli: Has anyone seen the couch cushions? 
Bluey: Mum, Bingo and I are Neighbours. 
Chilli: Oh, nice one!
Bluey: Do you wanna play? You can move next to Bingo if you'd like.
Chilli: Em... Yeah, OK.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Chilli: There.
Chilli: Hi, neighbour!
Bluey: Hi, neighbour! Welcome to Mulberry Street. 
Bandit: Has anyone seen the couch cushions? 
Bluey: Dad! Do you want to move into Mulberry Street? 
Chilli: Please say no. 
Bandit: Yeah, right-o. 
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray! 
Bandit: I'll move right next to mum.
Chilli: There goes the neighbourhood.
Bandit: There.
Bluey: Beep beep boop boop. Hello, neighbour!
Chilli: Hello.
Bluey: Should I come over for book club now?
Chilli: Oh, yes. Hop on over, neighbour.
Bingo: Mmm, I'll have to build you a stable, Buckles. Hmm...
Bingo: There you go, Buckles.
Bluey: Hello, neighbour. Let's start book club.
Chilli: Yes, let's. So, did you think the caterpillar needed to eat quite that much?
Bluey: What is that noise?
Chilli: Ugh. That's my neighbour!
Chilli: He's rather noisy. I'll try asking him nicely. Excuse me, would you mind keeping the noise down?
Chilli: Let's try this again tomorrow.
Bluey: Well, I'm glad I don't have a neighbour like that. Bingo!
Bingo: What?
Bluey: You moved your house into my reading area!
Bingo: I needed that bit for my animals.
Bluey: Beep beep boop!
Chilli: Hello?
Bluey: Bingo took my reading area and she's not giving it back.
Chilli: Well, have you tried asking her nicely?
Bluey: Uh, not yet. What's all that noise?
Chilli: Oh, it's my neighbour. He's... well... I don't know WHAT he's doing.
Chilli: Will you PLEASE keep it down?
Chilli: Ugh! I'll have to call you back.
Bluey: OK. I'll try asking Bingo nicely. Bye! Beep boop. Bingo!
Bingo: Hello, neighbour.
Bluey: Hello. Um, you have a lovely house.
Bingo: Thanks. 
Bluey: But, one problem: your wall is where my reading room was.
Bingo: Yes, I needed room for Buckles' stable.
Bluey: But where am I supposed to read?
Bingo: You can read over there.
Bluey: Well... I guess. It's just that I...
Bingo: Ring, ring! Hello? Yes, I need those bricks here in the morning. 
Bluey: Hey! 
Bingo: They better be here!
Bluey: Knock, knock!
Chilli: Come in!
Bluey: I tried asking nicely and she said no!
Chilli: I'm sorry, you'll have to speak up!
Bluey: Maybe let's go to my house!
Chilli: Maybe let's go to your house!
Bandit: WOOOOOW! 
Bluey: You've taken my whole front yard!
Bingo: Buckles had babies.
Bluey: This isn't fair, Bingo.
Bingo: Do you like it? Yeah you do, baby Buckles.
Chilli: Bingo!
Bluey: See?
Chilli: I do see.
Bluey: What should I do?
Chilli: Hmm...
Bluey and Chilli: No!
Chilli: What in the world are you doing?!
Bandit: Chainsawin'! 
Chilli: You chopped down my tree!
Bandit: I chainsawed down your tree. 
Bluey: You destroyed her roof!
Bandit: Yeah, nah, it was already like that.
Chilli: No, it wasn't!
Bandit: Yeah, it was! 
Chilli: Excuse me for a second, neighbour. It's time to put an end to this once and for all.
Bluey: How will you do that?
Chilli: I'll just ask nicely.
Chilli: Excuse me, neighbour.
Bandit: Huh?
Chilli: You've broken my roof. So, I would like for you to be a good neighbour and do something for me.
Bandit: Like what?
Chilli: Please fix it.
Bandit: Nah, I don't reckon, love.
Chilli: Please. Fix. It.
Bandit: Uh, OK. I guess I can fix it now. 
Chilli: Thank you, neighbour.
Bandit: I'm sorry. It just gets so lonely sometimes. Thought chainsawing might cheer me up.
Bluey: Ooh, maybe you need some pets.
Bandit: Hmm...
Chilli: OK. Now, the Bingo situation.
Bluey: Don't worry, mum. I'm gonna try asking nicely. 
Chilli: Oh!
Bingo: There you go, penguin.
Bluey: Oh! Gumdrops. I see that you have penguins in my living room now. Excuse me, neighbour.
Bingo: What is it? I'm busy.
Bluey: Please remove the penguins.
Bingo: Well, I don't really want to.
Bingo: OK. I'll remove my penguins.
Bluey: Thank you, neighbour.
Bingo: But where will my animals live?
Bluey: I have an idea.
Bluey: Hello, neighbour!
Chilli: Oh, hi. Goodness! That's all my neighbour's noisy stuff.
Bluey: Yeah, I traded it for Bingo's baby Buckles.
Bandit: Oh, you're so beautiful. Yes you are, yes you are!
Chilli: I love the new pets, neighbour!
Bandit: Shush! Baby Buckles likes it quiet.
Chilli: Oh, OK. Sorry.
Bluey: There. Ahh, I love this street.
