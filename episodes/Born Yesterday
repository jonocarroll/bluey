Chilli:“Hey!”
Bluey;Oh, look, Raelene, it jiggles.
(GIGGLES)
Chilli: Kids, don't take photos
of people's bottoms.
Bluey; But we're holiday people.
It's the first time
we've ever seen this bottom.
Budup. Budup.
Bingo; That's a good one.
Chilli; I don't care. It's rude.
Take photos of something else.
Bingo: OK, I'll take photos of leafs.
Leafs are exciting.
Bluey: Why is it rude to take photos
of your bottom?
Chilli;It just is.
Bluey:But it's just a bottom.
Chilli: Just trust me.
Chilli; I've been on this planet
longer than you.
Bluey; OK.
Chilli; If you're looking for something to
do, the dishwasher needs unpacking.
Bandit;Dad enters the room.
Bingo;Dad, look at my leaf photos.
Bandit; Pretty cool leaves, Bingo.
Bluey; Dad, can you bend over?
Chilli; Bluey!
Bluey;What?
Bandit; No chance, kid.
Bandit; I wasn't born yesterday.
Both; huh?
Bingo; You weren't born what?
Bandit; I wasn't born yesterday.
It's a saying.
Bandit;It means
I've been around long enough
Bandit; to know exposing my rear end
to you isn't a good idea.
Bingo; Hee-hee. Born yesterday.
Bluey; Bingo, I've got an idea.
Chilli; Is it about
unpacking the dishwasher?
Bluey;no!
Bluey:Dad, can you pretend
you actually WERE born yesterday?
Yeah!
Bandit; Oh, man.
Bandit; Is it too late to bend over?
BLUEY: This episode of Bluey
is called Born Yesterday.
BOTH: Ready? And...
born yesterday!
(SINGS) Aaaaah!
BOTH: Hooray!
Wow!
My second day on the planet.
Look at all this. It's amazing!
And look at this little blue thing.
Ohh.
And a red thing!
Hi.
Agh!
(BOTH GIGGLE)
It makes noises. Amazing.
Who are you calling 'It'?
We have names.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was born yesterday.
I don't know what a name is.
It's something you call something.
Like my name is Bluey.
And mine's Bingo.
Blue-y.
Bin-go.
BOTH: Yes.
Can I have a name?
You've already got one.
It's Bandit.
Ban-dit. I like it.
Oh, look at that.
This is the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.
It's just a stool.
Hello, stool.
My name is Bandit.
BOTH: (GIGGLE) Stools can't talk!
Really? Why?
They're not alive.
Alive?
Yeah.
Alive?
No, that's not alive.
Oh! Uh, is it?
That's called food.
You put it in your mouth.
Why would I put it in my... Ohh.
Oh, I feel like a new dog.
I like food.
Thanks for the update.
And stools can't talk.
Kids, what have you done
to your dad?
He was born yesterday.
He doesn't know anything.
Are you alive?
Yoo-hoo!
Hi, I'm your wife.
My wife?
Yes, and if you want me
to stay your wife,
you'll learn about dishwashers.
Dishwasher. Wife.
Wow. There's just so much to learn.
Whoa!
This is outside.
You've got some grass and some wood.
A fence.
Argh! Look out!
BOTH: What is it?
There's a giant fireball
in the big blue thing.
That's the sun.
It's meant to be there.
And the big blue thing is the sky.
Oh. Phew.
This is a swing.
Push me!
Swing.
No, the other way.
Oh, OK.
Swing.
BOTH: (GIGGLE) No!
This way.
Oh, swing.
This is... Oh!
(BOTH GIGGLE)
So, this is our street.
You've got some cars
and, ooh, a bird.
Ooh, rubbish.
Ooh!
Don't worry about the sun.
It's meant to be there.
Uh, OK.
Ah, come on, Bandit.
Huh?
Keep walking.
I have a wife.
OK, Bandit, probably
don't say things about the sun
to people at bus stops.
Yeah.
Why?
It's hard to explain.
OK, I won't. Food!
(SINGS) Yeah, I got
my steak and bacon.
Food!
Oh, hey Bandit. Oi!
BOTH: Agh! Dad. No.
That's my pie!
Get off it!
Drop!
Gimme it.
Here!
Food!
Oh, you ate all the sauce!
Sorry, Lucky's Dad.
He was born yesterday.
Yeah, I'll say.
(GROANS)
I can't hold him!
Run, Lucky's Dad.
But I'm going that way.
Food!
Just go!
Wah!
Oh. Bye, food.
Ugh.
You can't just take people's food.
Why?
'Cause it doesn't belong to you.
B-long?
Yeah, like everyone's stuff
isn't everyone's, you know?
Everyone?
Look, just don't take people's food.
And don't talk about the sun, OK?
You have to just trust us.
Why?
Well, because we've been on
this planet longer than you.
That's true.
I was only born yesterday.
G'day, Bandit.
I have nothing to say
about the sun to you.
(BOTH GIGGLE)
Er, great.
Wow. Name?
Oh, that's called a...
Wait, Bingo.
It just makes trouble when we
tell him what things are called.
Why don't we let him enjoy
just looking at things today?
Yeah, we can teach him names later.
Name?
It doesn't matter. Just look.
Alive.
Hello, stool.
It's OK, Dad.
You can stop playing Born Yesterday.
Oh, you sure?
Yeah, it was fun.
Yeah, real fun. Thanks.
No worries. I enjoyed it.
I feel like a new dog.
Bingo, can you help me
unpack the dishwasher?
Sure.
Oh, good on you, kids.
Uh, kids?
BOTH: Yeah?
Has your dad
stopped playing Born Yesterday?
Yeah.
OK.
Just checking.
