TITLE CARD: Robo Bingo
The minisode starts in the bathroom. With Chilli walking in before turning around to call "Robo Bingo's" attention.
Chilli: "Okay, Robo Bingo, (*motions forward*) walk forward." 
Bingo comes into the bathroom, acting like an actual robot, she "doots" while walking foward.
Bingo: "Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot!"
After walking into the bathroom, the camera pans to a wide shot of Robo-Bingo walking to the bathroom sink. Then it zooms in towards the sink, where Robo-Bingo walks into the stool, still walking and dooting as she is stuck there.
Chilli: "Ah, stop walking, Robo-Bingo."
Bingo slowly stops.
Chilli: "Stop walking. Okay, now clean your teeth, Robo-Bingo."
Chilli places Robo-Bingo onto the stool, but she stands in place, not knowing what to do.
Chilli: "Uh, um, okay. Pick up the toothbrush."
Bingo: "Doot! (*picks up the toothbrush*)."
Chilli: "Pick up the toothpaste."
Bingo: "Doot! (*picks up the toothpaste*)."
Chilli: "Put the toothpaste on the toothbrush."
Bingo: "Doot! (*places the entire capsule onto the toothbrush*)."
Chilli: "Agh, (*the toothpaste falls onto the floor*), no!"
Chilli remains silent for a second before giving Robo-Bingo another command.
Chilli: "...Pick up the toothpaste."
Bingo: "Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot! (*turns around*). Doot! (*picks up the toothpaste*)."
Bingo stays in place.
Chilli: "Turn around."
Robo-Bingo does an endless 360 degrees spin while dooting.
Chilli: "Uh, stop turning!"
Robo-Bingo stops and faces towards the mirror.
Chilli: "Take off the lid."
Bingo: "Doot! Doot!"
Robo-Bingo tries to take off the lid, but with a toothbrush in one hand and a toothpaste bottle in the other, she struggles to complete the task. Chilli slightly shakes her head in annoyance as Robo-Bingo tries twice but fails.
Chilli: "Okay, put toothbrush down..."
Bingo: Doot! Doot! Doot! Doot!
Robo-Bingo puts the toothbrush on the floor, which shocks Chilli.
Chilli: "Ahh! Not on the floor, on the sink!"
Bingo: "Doot! (*places the toothbrush on the sink*)."
Chilli: "Now, take off lid."
Bingo: "Doot! (*pulls the lid off*)."
Chilli: "Put lid on sink."
Bingo: "Doot! (*does so*)."
Chilli: "Now pick up toothbrush."
Bingo: "Doot! (*does so*)."
Chilli: "Put toothpaste on it. (*motions how to do it*)."
Bingo: "Doot! Doot! (*puts the toothpaste on the toothbrush*)."
Chilli: "Put toothpaste on sink."
Bingo: "Doot! (*puts down the toothpaste*)."
Chilli: "Now, clean teeth."
Robo-Bingo frowns not knowing what to do. Chilli does the same.
Chilli: *sighs* "Put toothbrush in mouth..."
Bingo: "Doot! (*places the toothbrush between her teeth and bites it*)."
Chilli: "No! (*rolls eyes*) Put toothpastey bit in mouth, against teeth!"
Bingo: "Doot! (*takes the toothbrush out and places it against her teeth*)."
Chilli: "Now, like, brush it round. (*motions how to do it*)."
Robo-Bingo starts cleaning her teeth.
Chilli: "Oh, thank goodness."
The view pans out a bit, so we see a semi-wide view of the bathroom.
Chilli: "Front ones."
Chilli goes over to pick up a towel off the floor.
Chilli: "Back ones."
Chilli places the towel onto the bathtub.
Chilli: "Side ones."
A jump skip card appears that says: "Later".
Chilli: "Now stop!"
Robo-Bingo stops.
Chilli: (*turns the faucet on*) "Now for the big finish. Lean over the sink."
Robo-Bingo does so as she inflates her cheeks.
Chilli: "Now spit out the toothpaste into the sink."
Robo-Bingo does so.
Chilli: "Yep, that's it. Run the end of the toothbrush under the tap."
Bingo: "Doot! (*does so*)."
Chilli: "Put toothbrush on sink and..."
Bingo: "Doot! (*does so*)."
Chilli: "Done! Hooray! Well done, Robo-Bingo!"
Robo-Bingo starts to leave the bathroom, but then Bandit walks in asking her to do something really quick.
Bandit: "Hey, Bingo, make sure you do a wee before bed."
Robo-Bingo stops walking mid-sentence, and when Bandit finishes his sentence...well...
Bingo: "Doot! (*squats down*)."
Chilli: "NO!"
The minisode ends.
