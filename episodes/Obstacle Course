Dad: Snap! Ha-ha! Yeah!
Bluey: Oh, you win every time!
Dad: 'Cause you're too slow.
Bingo: You need to let Bluey win sometimes.
Dad: Why would I do THAT?
Mum: Because she's a child.
Dad: You don't want me to let you win, Bluey. Trust me.
Bluey: Why not?
Dad: Because you'll give up trying to get better.
Mum: And what does losing EVERY TIME do?
Dad: Nothing much.
Mum: Oh, really? Care for a game of memory snap?
Dad: No way! I hate memory snap.
Mum: And why is that?
Dad: Because I lose every time. Snap! Ha-ha!
Bluey: Ohh!
Dad: I'm like a mongoose.
BLUEY AND BINGO GIGGLE

Dad: Hey, have you kids seen my green...ball?
Bluey: Look, Dad! We set up an obstacle course!
Bingo: Do you want to have a go?
Dad: Righto, I'll race you. Where's the finish line?
Mum: No-one's racing anyone. This is just for having fun!
Bingo: Yeah!
Dad: Oh, I see. (START MAKING CHICKEN SOUND) Bawk! Buk-buk-buk-buk-buk-buk. Bawk!
Bluey: What are you doing?
'Dad: I'm doing chicken. (KEEP MAKING CHICKEN SOUND) Buk-buk-buk-buk-buk-buk. Bawk!
Bluey: Why is Dad acting like a chicken?
Mum: He's saying you're scared.
Bingo: Of chickens?
Dad: No, of racing me. Don't you kids know what 'chicken' means?
Mum: No. And they don't need everything turned into a competition.
Dad: That's loser talk. Come on. The hose is the finish line. Ready? Set.
Mum: No! They're not racing.
Bingo: Yeah, we're happy just having fun.
Dad: Winner gets sherbet.

Mum: OK. Well done.
Dad: Thanks. Now I might go and get my sherbet.
Bluey and Bingo: Ohh!
Mum: Yeah, you do that. I think we've had enough Dad for one morning. OK, let's go back to having fun.
Bluey:That WAS fun!
Bingo: Yeah!
Mum: What?!
Bluey: I want another race! Can you help me beat Dad?
Bingo: Yeah, I want sherbet.
Mum: OK. He won't let you win, though.
Bluey: That's true.
Mum: There's only one thing you can do.
Bluey: Cheat!
Bingo: Yeah!
Bluey:Yeah... What? No. I meant practise!
Dad:You kids sure are keen to get whooped again.
Bingo: Oh, yes. We are.
Bluey: All we can do is try harder this time.
Dad: That's the way. See, Mum? Losing doesn't stop THESE kids.
Mum: It sure doesn't.
Bingo: Ready, set, go!
Dad: Hey! That was a good start, but there's no way you're gonna beat me!
DAD STUCK UNDER OBSTACLE
Dad: Hey, what? This wasn't this low before.
Bluey: Ha-ha! See ya!
Bingo: Come on, Bluey!
Bluey: I won!
Bingo: Sherbet!
Mum: Give it up, big guy! It's over!
Dad: Grr.
Bingo: Oh, I love you, sherbet.
Dad: Well done, Bluey! You won!
Mum: What's up, Bluey? Not enjoying your sherbet?
Bluey: No.
Mum: Tastes a bit sour, right?
Bluey: Yeah!
Bingo: Sherbet's MEANT to taste sour.
Bluey: I think I want to beat Dad fair and square.
Mum: Yeah, I think you do too. Come on.
MUM TAKE BACK SHERBET
Bingo: What?! No! But we won that!
Mum: It will taste so much sweeter when you win fair and square.
Bingo: But sherbet's not meant to be sweet.
YOGA BALL OBSTACLE

Bingo: Ready, set, go!
Bluey: Huh!
Bingo: Stop!
Mum: We'll work on that.
SLIDE OBSTACLE
Mum: Don't waste time getting on to your bum. Just go down on your belly!
Bluey: Agh!
LADDER OBSTACLE
Mum: That's it! That's it! 
Bingo: That's it! That's it!
Mum: Now, why are you CLIMBING down?
Dad: What do you mean?
Mum: Will your dad spend all that time climbing down?
Bluey: No, he would just jump.
Mum: Well, then YOU'VE got to jump.
Bluey: But it's too high!
Mum: No, it's not.
Bingo: Come on, Bluey! Hurry!
Bluey: Isn't there an easier way to be Dad?
Mum: I wish there was, kid. Believe me. But, unfortunately, your dad's right these obstacles aren't going to get out of the way by themselves.
Bluey: OK. Huh!
Mum: Yeah!
Bingo: Stop! Zero.
Mum: Zero! Oh, no, you pushed the wrong button, sweetie. It's this one.
Bingo: Oh.
Bluey: Again!
BLUEY KEEP PRACTICING
Mum: How fast can you run?
Bluey: As fast as a greyhound!
Mum: How fast ARE you gonna run?!
Bluey: As fast as a greyhound!
Bingo: Zero.
REMATCH
Dad: Alright, winds are favourable. I've inspected the track this time. No little surprises.
Mum: How fast can you run?
Bluey: As fast as a greyhound.
Mum: How fast are you GONNA run?
Bluey: As fast as a greyhound!
Dad: A bit more greyhound talk than last time, but that's fine.
Bluey: Father, I apologise for cheating in our last race.
Dad: Oh, well, yeah, good. Cheaters never prosper.
Bluey: Indeed. I wish you good luck.
Dad: Uh... You too.
Bingo: Ready? Set. Go!
Bluey: Huh! 
Dad: What?! How'd you learn to do that?!
Bingo: Whoo!
Mum: That's it, Bluey. That's it.
Bingo: Come on, Bluey!
Dad: What the...
Bingo: Come on!
Bluey: Huh! Huh! Huh!
Dad: Come on, mongoose! (GRUNTS)
Bluey: I'm gonna win!
DAD PULL BLUEY
Mum and Bingo: Hey!
Mum: What...was that?!
Dad: Uh... Yeah... I can't be sure.
Bingo: You cheated!
Dad: Well... Did I?
Mum and Bingo: Yes!
Dad: Ah, who can say for sure? When the mongoose is moving at full speed, you know, it's all a bit of a blur.
Mum: I think the mongoose couldn't handle losing to a child.
Bingo: You get zero.
Dad: Alright. Alright. Rematch? Rematch? Rematch?
Mum: Bluey?
Bluey: Let's settle it with a game of...memory snap.
Dad: Oh, biscuits.
INDOOR
Dad: Uh... Giraffe. Uh... Oh, where was that other giraffe? Oh, monkey?!
Bluey: Giraffe, giraffe. Monkey, monkey. Eagle, eagle.
Dad: How do you do that?
Mum: You might as well start now, Bingo.
Bingo: Hooray!
Bluey: Greyhound, greyhound. I win!
Dad: Argh!
