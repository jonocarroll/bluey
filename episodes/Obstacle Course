The episode opens in the foyer. Bluey and Bandit are playing Snap on the floor. Chilli is sitting in the armchair, and Bingo is sitting on her lap.
Bandit: "Snap! Ha-ha! Yeah!"
Bluey: "Oh, you win every time!"
Bandit: "'Cause you're too slow."
Bingo: "You need to let Bluey win sometimes."
Bandit: "Why would I do that?"
Chilli: "Because she's a child."
Bandit: "You don't want me to let you win, Bluey. Trust me."
Bandit squares the face up cards and and adds them to his pile. The game continues.
Bluey: "Why not?"
Bandit: "Because you'll give up trying to get better."
Chilli: "And what does losing every time do?"
Bandit: "Nothing much."
Chilli grabs the nearby box of memory snap.
Chilli: "Oh, really? Care for a game of memory snap?"
Bandit: "No way! I hate memory snap."
Chilli: "And why is that?"
Bandit: "Because I lose every time."
He snaps the card and wins.
Bandit: "Snap! Ha-HA!"
Bluey: "Ohh!"
Bandit jumps up and makes snatching gestures with his hand.
Bandit: "Phwoah! I'm like a mongoose."
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Chilli: "You're a goose, alright."
TITLE CARD: Obstacle Course
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Obstacle Course."
In the backyard, Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo have set up an obstacle course.
Chilli: "Go, Bingo!"
Bingo tries to bounce over the yoga ball, but bounces back. Bluey bounces over it.
Bingo: "Op!"
Bluey: "Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!"
Chilli: "Whoo! Go, Bluey!"
Bluey climbs and then slides down a plastic slide.
Bluey: "Whoop!"
Bluey dodges between some garden gnomes, set up like cones. She knocks one over.
Bluey: "Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!"
She crawls under a broom, laid across the backs of two chairs.
Bluey: "Ugh!"
She crawls through an cardboard box with the top and bottom open.
Bluey: "Uh!"
She vaults over the rim of a wading pool, then vaults out the other side.
Bluey: "Hup!"
She jumps over a rake, laid on the bottom of two flower pots. She knocks it down.
Bluey: "Ut!"
She rounds a flamingo, and starts heading back the other way. She crawls under the trampoline.
Bluey: "Huh!"
'Chilli lays a jump rope down in front of Bluey. Bluey tries to walk on it like a balance beam, but steps off repeatedly.
Chilli: "Go! Go! Go! Up the rope! Up the rope!"
Bluey climbs a rope ladder hanging from a branch of the poinciana.
Bluey: "And touch!"
Bandit enters the porch.
Bandit: "Hey, have you kids seen my green...ball."
Bluey: "Look, Dad! We set up an obstacle course!"
Bingo: "Do you want to have a go?"
Bandit: "Righto, I'll race you. Where's the finish line?"
Chilli: "No-one's racing anyone. This is just for having fun!"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bandit: "Oh, I see."
Bandit clucks and flaps his arms, doing a chicken impression.
Bandit: "Bawk! Buk-buk-buk-buk-buk-buk. Bawk!"
Bluey: "What are you doing?"
Bandit: "I'm doing chicken. Buk-buk-buk-buk-buk-buk. Bawk!"
Bluey: "Why is Dad acting like a chicken?"
Chilli: "He's saying you're scared."
Bingo: "Of chickens?"
Bandit: "No, of racing me. (incredulous) Don't you kids know what 'chicken' means?"
Chilli: "No. And they don't need everything turned into a competition."
Bandit: "That's loser talk. Come on. The hose is the finish line. Ready? Set."
Chilli: "No! They're not racing."
Bingo: "Yeah, we're happy just having fun."
Bandit: "Winner gets sherbet."
Bluey and Bingo squeal.
Bluey & Bingo: "Sherbet!"
Bluey: "Ready, set, go!"
Bingo: "Yah!
Bluey and Bingo take off, with Bandit behind them.
Chilli: "Wait!"
Bandit easily vaults over the yoga ball, taking an early lead. He vaults the slide, and passes the gnomes and broom with ease, too.
Bandit: "Ha-ha! I'm gonna flog ya!"
Bluey is still dodging gnomes.
Bluey: "Huh-huh-huh-huh!"
Bingo calmly slides down the slide."
Bingo: "Whee!"
Bandit has already made it to the rope. He climbs a single rung and tags the branch, then crosses the finish line.
Bandit: "Yar! Yes! Dad wins!"
Chilli: "OK. Well done."
Bandit: "Thanks. Now I might go and get my sherbet."
Bluey & Bingo: "Ohh!"
Chilli: "Yeah, you do that. I think we've had enough Dad for one morning. Okay, let's go back to having fun."
Bluey: "That was fun!"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
Chilli: "What?!"
Bluey: "I want another race! Can you help me beat Dad?"
Bingo: "Yeah, I want sherbet."
Chilli sighs.
Chilli: "Okay. He won't let you win, though."
Bluey: "That's true."
Chilli: "There's only one thing you can do."
Bluey: "Cheat!"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bluey: "Yeahâ€” What? No. I meant practise!"
The scene briefly cuts to a shot of the weathervane on the roof. Bingo brings Bandit to the hose, holding his tube of sherbet. Bluey and Chilli are waiting.
Bandit: "You kids sure are keen to get whooped again."
Bingo: "Oh, yes. We are."
Bingo giggles.
Bluey: "All we can do is try harder this time."
Bandit: "That's the way. See, Mum? Losing doesn't stop these kids."
Chilli: "It sure doesn't."
Bingo: "Readysetgo!"
Bandit: "Hey! That was a good start, but there's no way you're gonna beat me!"
Bluey ducks under the broom - which is now laying across the chair seats, not the backs. Bandit can't fit under it. Bluey turns around and jogs in place as she watches him try to squeeze under.
Bandit: "Hey, what? This wasn't this low before."
Bluey: "Ha-ha! See ya!"
She runs off.
Bingo: "Come on, Bluey!"
Chilli shakes her head. Bluey rounds the last obstacles and crosses the finish line while Bandit is still stuck at the broom.
Bluey: "I won!"
Chilli hands Bluey the sherbet.
Bingo: "SHERBET!"
Chilli: "Give it up, big guy! It's over!
Dad gives up on fitting under the broom.
Bandit: "Grr."
Bluey pours Bingo a handful of sherbet, which she licks up. She pours some directly in her mouth.
Bingo: "Oh, I love you, sherbet."
Bandit: (sarcastically) "Well done, Bluey! You 'won'!"
Bingo reaches out for more sherbet, but Bluey is distracted.
Chilli: "What's up, Bluey? Not enjoying your sherbet?"
Bluey: "No."
Chilli: "Tastes a bit sour, right?"
Bluey: "Yeah!"
Bingo: "Sherbet's meant to taste sour."
Bluey: "I think I want to beat Dad fair and square."
Chilli: "Yeah, I think you do too. Come on."
Bluey hands the sherbet back to Chilli.
Bingo: "What?! NO! But we won that!"
Chilli: "It will taste so much sweeter when you win fair and square."
Bingo: "But sherbet's not meant to be sweet."
At the yoga ball.
Chilli: "OK, the key to this one: use the ball to speed you up."
She jumps over the ball, bouncing off it to gain forward momentum..
Chilli: "Hup! You try."
Bingo: "Readysetgo!"
Bingo presses a button on the stopwatch. Bluey jumps over the ball, bouncing off it, and tumbling to the ground.
Bluey: "Huh!"
Bingo presses the stopwatch again.
Bingo: "Stop!"
Chilli: "We'll work on that."
At the slide.
Chilli: "Don't waste time getting onto your bum. Just go down on your belly!"
Bluey slides down on her belly. Chilli and Bingo both wince.
Bluey: "Agh!"
At the ladder, Bluey climbs to the branch.
Chilli: "That's it! That's it!"
Bingo: "That's it! That's it!"
Bluey climbs down the ladder.
Chilli: "Now, why are you climbing down?"
Bandit: "What do you mean?"
Chilli: "Will your dad spend all that time climbing down?"
Bluey: "No, he would just jump."
Chilli: "Well, then you've got to jump."
Bluey: "But it's too high!"
Chilli: "No, it's not."
Bingo: "Come on, Bluey! Hurry!"
Bluey: "Isn't there an easier way to beat Dad?"
Chilli: "I wish there was, kid. (shooting a glance at the camera) Believe me. But, unfortunately, your dad's right: these obstacles aren't going to get out of the way by themselves."
Bluey: "Okay. Huh!"
She jumps down and crosses the finish line.
Chilli: "Yeah!"
Bingo: "Stop! Zero."
Chilli: "Zero!"
Chilli: (to Bingo) "Oh, no, you pushed the wrong button, sweetie. It's this one."
Bingo: "Oh."
Bluey: "Again!"
In a montage, Bluey runs the obstacle course again. Chilli runs beside her, giving advice and encouragement. She shows Bingo which button to press on the stopwatch again. Chilli demonstrates tightrope walking on the jumprope. Bluey runs around the gnomes. She runs the obstacle course again, with Chilli running beside her.
Chilli: "How fast can you run?"
Bluey: "As fast as a greyhound!"
Chilli: "How fast ARE you gonna run?!"
Bluey: "AS FAST AS A GREYHOUND!"
Bluey crosses the finish line.
Bingo: (awed) "Zero."
Bandit approaches the starting line, stretching his arms. Bluey jogs in place as Chilli gives her a pep talk.
Bandit: "Alright, winds are favourable. I've inspected the track this time. No little surprises."
Chilli: (whispering) "How fast can you run?"
Bluey: (whispering) "As fast as a greyhound."
Chilli: (whispering) "How fast are you gonna run?"
Bluey: (whispering) "As fast as a greyhound!"
Bandit: "A bit more greyhound talk than last time, but that's fine."
Bluey: (formally) "Father, I apologise for cheating in our last race."
Bandit: "Oh, well, yeah, good. Cheaters never prosper."
Bluey: (formally) "Indeed. I wish you good luck."
She offers her hand, and Bandit shakes it.
Bandit: "Uh... You too."
Bingo: "Ready? Set. Go!"
Bluey: "Huh! "
Bluey vaults the yoga ball, ahead of Bandit.
Bandit: "What?! How'd you learn to do that?!"
She slides the slide on her belly, dodges the gnomes, ducks under the broom, crawls through the box, and splashes through the pool, staying just ahead of Bandit.
'Bingo howls in excitement.
Chilli: "That's it, Bluey. That's it."
Bluey crawls under the trampoline, still in the lead.
Bingo: "Come on, Bluey!"
Bandit: "What the..."
Bingo: "Come on!"
Bluey climbs the rope ladder, still barely in the lead.
Bluey: "Huh! Huh! Huh!"
Bandit climbs a single step and tags the branch.
Bandit: "Come on, mongoose!"
Bandit grunts with effort. They sprint for the finish line.
Bluey: "I'm gonna win!"
Bandit grabs Bluey by the scruff of her neck and yanks her backwards. He crosses the finish line first.
Chilli & Bingo: "Hey!"
Chilli: "What... was that?!"
Bandit: "Uh... Yeah... I can't be sure."
Bingo: "You CHEATED!"
Bandit: "Well... Did I?"
Chilli & Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bandit: "Ah, who can say for sure? When the mongoose is moving at full speed, you know, it's all a bit of a blur."
Chilli: "I think the 'mongoose' couldn't handle losing to a child."
Bingo: "You get zero."
Bandit: "Alright. Alright. Rematch? Rematch? Rematch?"
He points to Chilli, Bingo, and Bluey in turn.
Chilli: "Bluey?"
Bluey: (smugly) "Let's settle it with a game of... memory snap."
Bandit: "Oh, biscuits."
Back in the foyer, Bluey and Bandit are playing memory snap. Chilli and Bingo are back in the armchair.
Bandit: "Uh... Giraffe. Uh... Oh, where was that other giraffe? "
He turns over a card.
Bandit: "Oh, monkey?!"
Bingo giggles.
Bluey: "Giraffe, giraffe. Monkey, monkey. Eagle, eagle.
Bluey takes three pairs, leaving only two cards on the field.
Bandit: "How do you do that?"
Chilli: "You might as well start now, Bingo."
Chilli hands Bingo the tube of sherbet.
Bingo: "Hooray!"
Bluey: "Greyhound, greyhound. I win!"
Bandit: "Ughh!"
The music from the first two obstacle course runs plays over the end credits. Bingo walks in, holding the stopwatch. She looks back and forth between the credits and the watch, then presses a button when Screen Queensland/Queensland Government acknowledgements appear. She proudly holds up the stopwatch to the audience, displaying 0:0.
