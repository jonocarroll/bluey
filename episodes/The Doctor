The episode opens in the playroom. Half the fabric-roofed play house has been curtained off with a towel, making an "office". Bluey is sitting at a low table in front of the play house, typing on a "computer" made from a sideways book. Chairs have been arranged in a semicircle in front of her table.
Bluey: "Ring, ring!"
Bluey pantomimes answering a phone. She pretends to examine her nails as she talks.
Bluey: "This is the doctor's office. Hello. It's Edna speaking. How are you?"
Honey walks up to Bluey.
Honey: "Hello, I need to see the doctor now."
Bluey holds up a finger in the universal gesture for "one second", and continues talking on the phone.
Bluey: "Mm, yes, okay. Sure, okay, we'll see you in 15 months. Bye. Click."
Bingo and Chilli emerge from behind the curtain. Bingo is wearing a wooden stethoscope, and Chilli has a pink ribbon tied around her nose.
Chilli: "Thank you, Doctor. My schnozz feels great."
Bingo: "Just keep it on for six months. See ya!"
Bluey: "Please choose a lollipop on your way out."
Chilli: "Why, thank you."
Chilli takes a lollipop and licks it.
Chilli: "Ooh, lychee."
TITLE CARD - The Doctor
Bluey : "This episode of Bluey is called: The Doctor."
Bluey: "Sorry about that. How can I help?"
Honey: "I need to see the doctor."
Bluey pretends to type.
Bluey: "Oh, yes, I'm sure we can squeeze you in tightly."
Honey jumps in celebration.
Honey: "Great!"
Bluey: "Now, what's wrong with you today?"
Honey: "Nothing. I'm fine."
Bluey: (whispering) "Honey, playing doctors, you have to make up something wrong with you."
Honey: "Oh, yes, of course. "
Honey thinks for a moment.
Honey: "What do you think should be wrong with me?"
Bluey: "It's up to you."
Honey: "Um, what if... I bumped my knee?"
Honey holds up her knee and giggles.
Bluey: "Okay, here's a clipboard. Please take a seat. The doctor won't be long."
Honey starts to walk towards the seats.
Bluey: {whispering) "Honey, you have to hobble when you walk."
Honey: "Oh, yes."
Honey limps to a chair and sits down. After a moment, Bingo emerges from the office.
Bingo: "Next patient please!"
Honey: "That's me!"
Honey jumps up and takes a step.
Bluey: "Hobble!"
Honey limps to the front desk.
Bingo: "What seems to be the matter?"
Bluey: "She's bumped her knee, Doctor."
Bingo: "Oh. You sure that's it?"
Honey: "Yeah, that's it."
Bingo: "Okay, we'll have that fixed in a jiffy."
Bingo pulls a grabber claw out from behind the desk, and clicks it twice.
Lucky: (offscreen) "Aaaah!"
Lucky runs in to the waiting area. He's holding a crocodile plush to his head and thrashing it around.
Lucky: "I need to see the doctor!"
Bingo hands Honey the claw and runs to examine Lucky.
Lucky: "Ooh, there's a crocodile on my head!"
Bingo: "Oh, my. This is a real pickle."
Bingo puts a hand on Lucky's back and starts to guide him towards the office. Lucky has his eyes closed and is feeling in front of him with his hands.
Bingo: "Don't worry!"
Lucky walks into the table.
Lucky: "Ow!"
Bingo points him towards the office.
Bingo: "We'll fix that in a jiffy."
Bingo and Lucky enter the office. Bingo sticks her head out for one last comment.
Bingo: "Edna, hold my appointments."
Bluey: "Oh, I'm sorry dear. Please take a seat. I'm sure the doctor won't be long."
Bingo: (from offscreen) "This is gonna take ages!"
Honey: "Oh, okay."
Honey puts the claw down on the chair next to her, sits down, and takes a magazine to read. Bluey pretends to type. The office curtain begins to thrash around. One plushie after another is thrown out into the room.
Bingo: (offscreen) "I'm just trying to pull the mouth open!"
Lucky: (offscreen) "Ugh!"
Bingo: (offscreen) "This might sting..."
Lucky: (offscreen) "Ugh!"
Bingo is pulls on something so hard that she's leaning out from behind the curtain.
Bingo: "...but just for a little bit!"
Bingo snaps back behind the curtain.
Lucky: (offscreen) "Ow!"
Bingo: (offscreen) "Aaaaaah!"
Bingo is visible past the edge of the curtain again. She appears to climb up Lucky's body and stand on his shoulders to grab the alligator's tail.
Bingo: (panting) "He's a wily one!"
Bingo yanks on the tail.
Bingo: "Yaaaah!"
Bingo loses her grip and falls into one of the wooden play house supports.
Lucky: (offscreen) "Oh, careful doctor!"
Bingo: "Ow!"
Bingo gets up and charges shoulder-first into the office. Toys are being flung out at an even faster rate.
Bluey: "Would you like a cup of tea while you wait?"
Honey: "Yes, thanks."
Lucky: (offscreen) "Ugh!"
Bingo: (offscreen) "Yaaaah!"
The shot changes to focus on just Bluey and Honey. Bluey hands Honey a teacup and saucer.
Bluey: "Are you sure you haven't been attacked by a giraffe or something?"
Honey: "Um, no."
Bluey: "Cause that would be a real pickle."
Bingo: (offscreen) "There it goes!"
We hear a pop, and the alligator plush sails over Bluey and Honey's heads. It lands offscreen with a clatter.
Bluey: "Oh. Looks like she's done."
Bingo shows Lucky out of the office.
Bingo: "Out you come."
Lucky emerges. Bingo has wrapped his entire head in an elastic bandage. Unable to see, he's feeling in front of him with his arms.
Lucky: "Beautiful, Doctor."
Bingo: "Just keep the bandages on for 11 years."
Lucky walks into the desk again.
Bluey: "Choose a lollipop."
Lucky feels around the table until he finds a lollipop.
Lucky: "See ya."
Lucky walks out, still feeling in front of him with his free hand.
Bingo: "Okay, who's next?"
Honey: "That's me!"
Bingo: "Oh, yes â€” sore knee. Right this way."
Bingo gestures towards the office, and Honey stands up. At that moment, Snickers runs in holding an inflatable cactus wearing a sombrero.
Snickers: "Help! I cuddled a cactus!"
Bluey: "Oh, no!"
Snickers swings around, revealing the crocodile plush attached to his bum.
Bluey, Bingo, Honey: "Aaah!"
Snickers: "And then a crocodile flew out of the sky and bit me on the bottom!"
Bluey: "My stars! This is a real pickle!"
Bingo: "Don't worry."
Bingo whips out a toy eggbeater.
Bingo: "We'll have you fixed in a jiffy."
Bingo walks back to the office, Snickers follows.
Snickers: "Oww, oww, oww, oww, oww!"
Bingo: "Edna, hold my appointments!"
Snickers: "Oww, oww, oww, oww!"
Bingo and Snickers enter the office.
Honey: "Awww! But what about my knee?"
Honey sits back down, sadly. The office curtain begins to thrash again. The cactus emerges briefly, with Bingo riding it.
Snickers: (offscreen) "Oww!"
Bingo: (offscreen) "Aah! Wriggling will just make it hurt more!"
The eggbeater flies out of the office. Bluey brings Honey another cup of tea.
Bluey: "Oh, I'm sorry about the wait, Honey."
Honey: "Am I definitely the next patient, Bluey?"
Bluey: "You are definitely the next patient."
Indy and Coco run in. Indy has hidden her arms inside her vest, and Coco is wearing a red foam finger with the number 1 on it.
Coco: "Aaaaah!"
Indy: "We need to see the doctor!"
Bluey: "Oh, my!"
Indy: "I was hanging out the washing, and my arms fell off!"
Coco: "And I got bitten by seven scorpions."
Bluey: "Oh, my, my!"
Honey: (disappointed) "Awww, this looks like a real pickle."
Indy and Coco: "It is!"
Honey: "I'm never gonna see the doctor."
Bluey: "Don't worry, Honey. I promise you'll be the next patient."
Honey: "Really?"
Bluey: "Yes. Definitely."
Rusty runs in. He's clutching his stomach.
Rusty: "Yaaaah! I need a doctor!"
Bluey: "What's wrong, Rusty?"
Rusty: "I accidentally ate a hippopotamus. And now when I burp, I burp out baby hippopotamuses. Burp!"
Rusty throws out a wind-up hippo toy, which runs around on the rug.
Bluey, Honey, Indy, and Coco: "Aah!"
Bluey: "Oh, no! Baby hippos!"
Bluey starts chasing the wind-up hippo.
Coco: "Quick, Indy, grab it!"
Indy: "But I've got no arms!"
Bluey: "Aah!"
The girls back away from the wind-up hippo. The hippo bumps into Honey's chair; she lifts her feet out of the way.
Coco: "Get 'em! Get 'em out!"
Indy: "Get him!"
Bluey comes back for round two.
Bluey: "Come on, little wriggly one!"
Bluey makes a grab for the hippo, but it runs between her legs. It passes by Indy and Coco.
Indy: " Aaah!"
Coco: "Get away, baby hippo!"
Rusty: "Burp!"
Rusty throws out two more wind-up hippos.
Bluey, Honey, Indy, Coco: "Aah!"
Rusty: "Two more!"
Bluey: "Ahh! Hippos everywhere!"
The girls climb up on chairs to avoid the hippos. Bingo and Snickers come out of the office. Bingo is carrying the crocodile plush, and Snickers is covered in colorful adhesive bandages.
Bingo: "Oh, my goodness! This is a real pickle! Rusty, you best come in here right away."
Rusty walks across the waiting room, clutching his stomach and moaning.
Rusty: "Ohhhhh!"
Bingo: "Edna, hold my appointments."
Honey: "I knew it."
Rusty and Bingo enter the office.
Bingo: (offscreen) Stay still!"
Rusty: (offscreen) Burp!"
Bingo: (offscreen) How many hippos have you got in there?"
Snickers: "Can I have a lollipop?"
Bluey nods. Snickers takes the last lollipop.
Bingo: (offscreen) Yaaah!"
Rusty: (offscreen) Burp!"
Bluey: "Don't be sad, Honey."
Bluey and Honey sit back down.
Honey: "Awwww. Everyone's problem is a real pickle, except mine."
Rusty: (offscreen) "Burp!"
Bingo: (offscreen) "Oh, my! Aaaaah!"
Rusty: (offscreen) "Oh, there's another one!"
Rustly leans out from the office and throws a hippo toy.
Rusty: "Burp! They're everywhere!"
Bingo: (offscreen) "Yahh!"
Bingo runs out of the office and captures the hippo.
Bingo: "Come here!"
The scene cuts back to Bluey and Honey.
Bingo: (offscreen) Yaaaah!"
Rusty and Bingo continue laughing and squealing in the background. Honey starts kicking her feet from side to side. Bluey copies her. Honey notices, and they both pause for a second. They both nod, and start kicking their feet in sync. After a moment, they both laugh.
Bluey: "You always make me laugh."
Honey: "Yeah, I always make you laugh."
They resume kicking their feet together. Bingo runs into the shot, chasing a wind-up hippo.
Bingo: "Come here, you crazy hippo!"
She carries it out of shot, pantomiming a struggle.
Bluey: "Do it again. Do something funny!"
Honey: "Okay, watch this."
The shot pulls back to show Coco and Indy as well. Honey gets up and as she talks, makes large exaggerated motions as though she's acting on a stage.
Honey: "Now, for most dogs, their tail wags, and their body stays still."
Honey demonstrates tail-wagging.
Honey: "But not me. Ta-da!"
Honey flails her whole body from side to side, while keeping the tip of her tail still. Bluey, Indy, and Coco laugh.
Coco: "That's so funny!"
Bingo and Rusty exit the office. Bingo is visibly exhausted.
Rusty: "Oh, thanks, Doctor. I won't eat any more hippopotamuses again."
Bingo: (breathing heavily) "I think there are â€” there are some lollipops
around here... somewhere."
The office is out of lollipops. Rusty looks around, confused. Bingo notices Honey, who is still flailing around.
Bingo: "Oh, my stars! Your tail and your body are all mixed up!"
Indy: (laughing) "Her body's wagging!"
Coco: (laughing) "But her tail is still!"
Bingo: "This is a real pickle."
Honey stops flailing about.
Honey: "Really? A pickle?"
Bingo: "This is the biggest pickle I've ever seen. Come with me right away."
The music begins to swell emotionally. Bingo gestures for Honey to follow her into the office. Honey's tail starts wagging for real as she follows, giggling.
Bingo: "Don't worry. We'll have you fixed up in a jiffy."
Bluey: "Hobble!"
Honey hops the last few steps into the office on one leg.
Bingo: "Edna, you best hold all of my appointments."
Bluey: "Sure thing."
Bluey returns to her seat as the receptionist and starts pretending to type. She hums along with the music. The music stops abruptly a moment before the climax, and the camera cuts to Bandit. He's lying on cushions on the floor, covered in toilet paper bandages and snake plushies, with a toy thermometer in his mouth.
Bandit: "Will the doctor be much longer?"
Bluey: (offscreen) "Oh, just be patient!"
The credits music is the episode theme. The children scream and laugh over the music as toys clatter.
