The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler house during a very early sunrise.
Cut to the kitchen counter where Heeler-pups are eating their breakfast cereal and Bandit is stuffing his backpack.
Bingo: "Dad, can you play with us?"
Bandit: "Sorry kiddo, I’ve gotta get to work."
Bingo: "Aw, I wish you didn’t have to work."
Bandit: "It’s what grownups do I’m afraid."
Bluey: "Well I’m glad I’m a kid."
Bandit: "Enjoy it while it lasts."
Bingo: "Please can you play with us?"
Bandit: "I can’t mate, I’ll see you later."
Bandit, having donned his backpack, somberly leaves the scene. Bingo leans on her paw, disappointed.
Bingo: "...Awwh..."
Bluey looks over at Bingo sadly.
Chilli enters the scene to occupy the spot Bandit had.
Chilli: "Hey kids, I bought some new felt pens!"
Chilli presents the pack full of felt pens to the pups.
The view changes to the point-of-view of Chilli.
The pups gasp in excitement.
Bingo & Bluey: "RUG ISLAND!"
The view cuts back to show both excited pups and bewildered Chilli.
Chilli: (nasally) "Huh?.."
(voiceover) Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called Rug Island"
The scene cuts to the diagonally downwards view of the now felt-pen littered backyard.
The pups, both now wearing a flower wreath, have dragged their kiwi-rug under the poinciana tree and placed it on top of a pile of cushions and pillows. Potted plants have been placed atop of the rug-lumps.
Bluey is standing on a standup paddleboard (SUP) with a makebelieve spear made of linked-together brown felt-pens, soon spearing and pulling up a blue felt pen she flaps around a little.
Bingo finishes setting up their shelter on their rug island.
Bluey arrives at the island shore on the paddleboard by pulling herself forward. 
Bluey: "I caught some fish!"
Bluey steps on the island and walks towards Bingo folding several felt-pen-fishes.
Bluey: "Oo, nice shelter, Bingo."
Bingo: "Thanks!"
Bingo turns and points towards the other side of their island.
Bingo: "I’m going to get some pipis."
Bingo walks out of the scene leaving Bluey at their shelter.
Cut to the pipi-felt-pen-littered shore on the other side of the island.
Bingo arrives at the scene from behind to the mount and starts gathering tan-coloured felt-pens.
Bingo: "Pipis doing wee-wees."
Bingo's giggle is soon interrupted by a loud, heavily exhausted groan.
The view zooms-out to reveal the beach has been invaded by an enormous, blue, lumbering creature!
The shocked Bingo gasps and drops the pipis she was carrying.
Bingo: "Bluey!"
The invader rolls up to a sitting position, revealing to be Bandit still wearing his necktie.
Groggy looking Bandit rubs his head.
Bandit: "Oh man... I must have fallen off my ship..."
Bluey with her spear arrives at the scene from the left.
Bluey: "What is it, Bingo?"
Bingo points at Bandit while standing behind him.
Bingo: "It’s a grownup!"
Bluey: "Let’s eat him!"
Bluey drops the spear and lunges to gnaw and tear off Bandit's waist.
Bandit: "Oww! Get off!"
Bingo pulls Bluey off from Bandit.
Bingo: "Don’t worry, we’re friendly."
Bluey: (menacingly) "I’m not!"
Bluey lunges to gnaw on Bandit's thigh.
Bandit: (hysterically) "Oww!"
Bingo again pulls Bluey off from Bandit.
Bingo: "Bluey, stop biting him!"
Bluey steps towards pointing Bandit.
Bluey: "Grownups don’t belong on Rug Island."
Bandit puts his paws together pleadingly.
Bandit: "Oh please; I just wanna get back to my ship."
Bingo: "Well you can stay with us until your ship comes back."
Bluey steps to hide behind Bingo and looks over menacingly.
Bluey: "Or until I get really hungry!"
Bandit: "Eeh!"
Bingo frowns at Bluey who has made Bandit cower in fear.
The scene moves a little towards the mountain at which Bandit and pups soon arrive to.
Bandit: "I gotta say, this place looks pretty chill."
Bandit lays down, leaning towards the mountain.
Bandit: "What’s for breakfast?"
Bluey: Listen, grown-up..."
Bluey pokes Bandit's stomach with her spear.
Bandit: "Oomph!"
Bluey: "...if you wanna stay on Rug Island, you have to work: Up-zup-zup!"
Bandit: "Aw man, ripped off."
The scene changes to an inside view of a jungle.
Bingo: "This is how we pick our own food."
Bingo pulls a magenta-coloured felt pen from a pot.
Bingo: "Fruit."
Bandit: "Ah, too easy."
Bandit pulls a long multicolored chain of felt pens from behind a pot.
Bandit: "Fruit."
Bluey: "That’s a snake."
Bandit: "AHHH, get off me!"
Bandit falls over flailing in panic.
Cut to the ocean where pups and Bandit are on the SUP-board each holding their own spear.
Bingo: "Spear."
Bingo spears and holds up a fish.
Bingo: "Fish."
Bandit: "Spear!"
Bandits' spear falls apart due to an incorrect technique.
Bandit: "Oh..."
Bingo: "It’s ok,"
Bingo piles and holds up some pieces of the spear.
Bingo: "Fish."
Bandit: "...Aah, I see..."
The scene cuts to island shelter.
Bandit pulls an orange felt pen from the pot behind the shelter.
Bandit: "Carrot!"
Bingo: "Yeah! You got it!"
Cut to the firepit area.
Bandit is operating a fire plough.
Bingo is studiously observing.
Bluey enters the scene from the left.
Bingo: "Watch what he can do... "
Bandit grabs a pawful of red felt pens and tosses them on top of the fire tinsel.
Bandit: "Whoosh."
Bingo: "Fire!"
Bandit stands up a little.
Bluey: "Err, grown up..."
Bluey points to the ground behind Bandit who grunts in confusion; there are cinders behind him which soon catch his bottom.
Bandit is launched onto his feet.
Bandit: "Yeow, my bottom!"
Bandit springs towards the ocean.
The pups cannot hold their giggling.
Bandit: (urgently) "Put it out! Put it out! Put it out!"
Bandit jumps and sinks his bottom into the water, putting a stop to the process of becoming too hot of a dog.
Bandit breathes a sigh of relief.
Scene cuts to the ocean under the poinciana tree.
Bingo and Bandit are gigging on their raft with great success.
Bandit: "Fish!"
Bingo: "Yeeeeaah!"
Cut back to the firepit.
 Bluey is assembling something that looks like a large spatula out of grey felt pens.
Bingo and Bandit soon arrive holding a great haul of fish in their paws.
Bingo & Bandit: "Fish."
Bandit, now sitting by the fire, rows together four wood pieces.
 Bingo is cooking fish with their new handheld grill over fire.
Bingo: "Cook, cook, cook."
Bandit: "Plate?"
Bluey takes the plate Bandit has offered.
Bluey: "Thanks."
Bluey picks up a purple felt pen laid next to her.
Bluey: "Have some beetroot."
Bluey puts the beetroot on the new plate Bandit has just finished building.
Bandit: "Ah, thanks"
Bandit shakes a tree behind him; Bandit catches a fallen yellow felt pen which he then offers to Bluey.
Bandit: "Banana?"
Bluey: "Ta!"
Bandit puts the banana on Bluey's plate.
Bingo grabs a green felt pen next to her.
Bingo: "Don’t forget the salads."
Bingo wiggles salads towards other diners.
Bandit: "Oh, wonderful salads!" (at the same time) Bluey: "Oh, they're delicious, Bingo!"
The view cuts from the direction of the shelter.
The sun is rising behind the mountains in the far-far-away-lands.
Bluey: "Thank you!" (at the same time) Bandit: "Aah, the greenery!"
The diners cackle.
The scene cuts back to the firepit-dining area now from an overhead view angle.
The diners are laying on the ground having finished their meal.
Bandit using a toothpick to clean his teeth.
Bandit: "I love Rug Island."
Bandit flicks the toothpick away.
Bluey: "Yeah, it’s great, isn’t it?"
Bingo: "Maybe you could stay here forever."
Bandit: "Really? You’d be ok with that?"
Bingo: "Yeah."
Bluey: "Well, it is tempting: Life’s so simple here. It’s like the outside world doesn’t exist..."
The serene moment is abruptly broken by a shriek coming from the direction of the ocean.
(offscreen) The noise: "CAAAAAATCH!"
A peculiar unidentified white oval-shaped object flies into an unguarded spot of Bandit.
Bandit: "Oargh!"
Bandit curls up in pain.
Bandit: (breathless) "What was that?!"
Bingo gasps.
Bluey: "Look!"
Bluey points towards the unknown flying object.
Bluey: "A white chocolate egg!"
The pups run towards the egg now floating a spear-length away off the shore.
Bluey drags the egg into her paws.
Bingo: "WOW!"
Accompanied by loud babbling sounds, the pups are licking the airspace around the egg.
A yellow grown-up pops from behind the fence at the horizon.
Pat: "I’ll get it, Lucky!"
Pat climbs over the fence and enters the backyard, scanning around for something.
Bluey is startled and gasps.
Bluey: "A grown-up! We have to hide!"
Bluey hands the egg to BIngo as the pups spring to the mountain to hide in the jungle.
Bandit follows after having his ears being tugged by Bluey while passing him.
In the jungle, Bandit and pups peek over some shrubbery to observe Pat.
Pat walks around the backyard still looking for a thing.
Pat: "Where’d it go?.."
Bluey: "He’s walking into water! It must be some sort of grownup magic."
Bingo: "What does he want?"
Bandit: "He wants the bal- I mean, the egg: It's his."
Bingo: "No way! We’re keeping it."
Bandit: "Well, yeah, but we have to give him his ball back, Bingo."
Bingo: "But it’s not a ball, it's an egg."
Bandit: "Well, yeah, but just in the game."
Bandit takes the egg into his possession, shocking Bingo.
Bingo: "Ah, no..."
Bingo becomes very let down.
Bluey: "I told you, Bingo: Grownups don’t belong on Rug Island."
Bandit walks towards Pat who enters the shores of Rug Island.
Pat: "Hey, Bandit. What’s with all the pens?"
Bandit: "Oh, um, it’s hard to explain."
Pat: "Uh, just need the ball?.."
Bandit: "Oh yeah, well..."
Bandit looks at Bingo who is becoming even more depressed.
Bandit: "The thing is..."
Pat: "Bandit?"
Bandit: "Ah, yep-yep. Here you go..."
Bandit offers the ball back to puzzled Pat.
Pat is just about to grab the ball when Bandit kneels and tosses a snake at Par.
Bandit: "Snake!"
Pat wrestles the snake.
Pat: "Aah, get it off me!!!"
Bandit rouses while pointing at Pat.
Bandit: "Get the grownup!"
Both pups pick up a banana.
Bingo: "Banana attack!"
Pat falls on his back still holding the snake at bay.
Pat: "Aah!"
Bluey and Bingo tickle Pat with the bananas.
Pat: "(laughing) Stop, stop! Lucky, help!
Bandit also joins in to tickle Pat with a banana.
Lucky peeks over the fence and starts chuckling at the sight.
Pat finally manages to wrestle off the snake and runs over the ocean to escape from Rug Island.
Bingo: "You naughty grownup!"
Lucky shuffles to the left as Pat reaches the fence.
Pat: "I was just trying to get the ball back, Unh!"
Pat climbs over the fence crashing on the lawn.
Bingo: "It’s not a ball!"
Bandit: "Yeah, it’s an egg!"
Pat gets up and runs to his home, leaving Lucky behind hanging on the fence.
Pat: "Heelp!"
Scene cuts back to the Rug Island to a coronation in progress.
Bluey clears her throat.
Bluey: "For good bravery and rescuing the chocolate egg, you are now not a grownup."
Bluey places a wreath on Bandit's head.
Bluey: "Congratulations!"
Bingo: Hurray!
Bluey lifts the egg.
Bluey: "Now, let us lick the egg!"
Bandit and the pups slobber the egg.
The morning continues.
Bingo and Bandit are once again fishing out in the ocean under the poinciana tree.
Bluey is assembling something tall at their shelter when BIngo and Bandit return to the island with their fish haul when suddenly, shouting is heard far away on the ocean.
(offscreen) The shouting: "Ahoy there!"
Chilli is waving at the verandah holding Bandit's backpack.
Bandit: "Oh, it’s my ship. They’ve come to take me home."
Bluey: "But this is your home."
Bingo: "You can’t have two homes."
Bandit: "Yeah, you’re right...What am I gonna do?"
Bingo: "You should go."
Bandit: "Really? Are you sure?"
Bingo: "Yes it’s okay. I’m just glad you came to Rug Island."
Bandit: "Ah, come here"
Bandit and Bingo hug each other.
Bandit: "I’m gonna miss you."
Bingo takes few steps backwards,
Bandit: "Maybe you can come with me."
Bingo: "No, this is my home."
Bandit boards his raft. 
Bingo runs to Bandit carrying something rolled in a banana leaf.
Bingo: "Wait! Here: It's a present for you."
Bandit: "Ah, thanks."
Bandit sets his present to the cargo hold of the raft before setting sail towards the boat to home.
Bingo and Bluey wave at Bandit as he disappears towards the horizon. 
Bandit boards the ship with the help of Captain Chilli.
Bandit and Chilli give one more look at the Rug Island before they sail away.
Bandit opens the present.
Chilli: "What did she give you?"
Close up view of Bandit holding...
Bandit: "...Everything."
The emotional music continues throughout. And instead of Bluey dancing, Bingo is cooking fish over fire.
