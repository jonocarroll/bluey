Bandit: I am.

Bandit: Ah, okay. Um, how are we gonna do this?
(The scene changes to everyone walking to the pool. Bandit is holding Bluey and the fun stuff in both arms and Bingo on his head)
Bandit: Ow, ow, ow! Hey, Bingo, what's going on up there?

(Bingo lets go of Bluey. She proceeds to jump on the gate.)
Bluey: Can someone open this gate?
(Bandit kicks the gate open but it closes. He lets out a sigh.)
(The kids excitedly run onto the pool area)
Bluey: Can I have my rashie?
Bandit: Did you bring it?
Bluey: No.
Bandit: Then no.
Bingo: Dad, did we bring sunscreen?
Bandit: Uh, no, I didn't...
Bluey: It's okay. We don't need sunscreen.
Bandit: Yes, we do. We'll just have to stay in the shady bit, and we'll put our hats on.
Bluey: What hats?
(Bandit facepalms)
Bluey: Hey, Bingo, check it out!
(Bluey jumps into the pool.)
Bingo: My turn!
(She notices the pool cleaner and gasps)
Bingo: Can you take that out?
Bandit: Nah, it keeps the pool clean, kiddo.
Bingo: Can I have my floaties?
Bandit: I didn't bring 'em.
Bingo: What?!
Bandit: Um... (Looks around)
Bandit: You'll have to stay on the shallow steps, Bin. (Puts Bingo in water)
Bingo: But I won't be able to swim away from the crawly thing.
Bluey: Dad, do you think I can swim from this side to that side all by myself?
Bandit: Yeah, you definitely could.
Bluey: No, you have to pretend that you don't think I could.
Bandit: Oh, I mean, no way! No one can swim that far!
Bluey: Watch this.
(Bluey starts swimming away)
Bandit: Oh, hey kiddo, sorry, not into the sunny bit. You've got no sunscreen on.
(Bluey groans)
Bandit: You'll be all right. Now, let's chill some beans! (Jumps into the pool)
(The scene changes to Bandit holding a pool noodle in the pool and Bluey outside the pool)
Bluey: Higher. Higher! Lower! Okay.
(She jumps over the noodle into the pool)
Bluey: (Emerging from the water) The water's making my eyes stingy.
Bandit: Yeah, that's the chlorine. Did you bring your goggles?
Bluey: No.
Bandit: Ah, okay. Well, we'll just have to play above-the-water games, kid.
Bluey: But I want to dive down and get the sinkies.
Bandit: Did you bring the sinkies?
Bluey: No.
Bandit: Well, that solves that, then.
Bingo: Aah! Dad! Aah!
(Bandit punches the pool cleaner that was floating towards Bingo)
Bingo: I... want... my... floaties!
Bluey: (Emerges from water again) Dad, is the shady bit gonna get bigger or smaller?
Bandit: Uh... bigger for sure.
(The scene transitions to the Bandit and the kids sitting in the shallow bit of the pool with the shadow only covering the said bit of the pool)
Bandit: Uh, I meant smaller.
Bluey: I'm bored.
Bandit: Hi, bored. Nice to meet you.
Bingo: I'm hungry.
Bandit: Oh, hello, hungry. This is bored.
(Bingo makes an angry noise)
Bandit: Ooh, tough crowd.
Bingo: I want some food.
Bandit: Aw, yeah, it's morning tea time!
(Kids cheer)
Bandit: But I didn't bring any food.
(Kids boo)
Bandit: You know what, kids? I think we might be done.
Bingo: No! I don't wanna get out!
(Bandit shakes)
Bandit: Come on, Bingo.
Bluey: I'm coooold!
Bandit: Well, grab your towel, kid.
Bluey: I didn't bring one.
Bandit: Just shake!
Bluey: I haven't learned how to shake yet!
(Bandit tries to get Bingo out of the pool)
Bandit: Come oooon!
Bingo: No, I don't want to get out!
(Bluey attempts to shake)
Bingo: I'm staying in the pool!
Bluey: (Still trying to shake) I can't shake properly!
Bandit: Bluey, give us a hand with your sister.
Bingo: I'm never getting out of this- (She notices the pool cleaner floating towards her again. She screams and jumps out of the pool into Bandits arms.)
(Bandit puts Bingo down)
Bingo: Dad, I'm cold!
Bluey: Dad, I'm freezing!
Bingo: Dad, I'm hungry.
Bluey: Dad, I'm starving!
(Bingo and Bluey repeatedly say "Dad")
Bandit: Okay! Can everyone stop saying "Dad"?
Bluey: I think Dad is actually boring. Mum is way more fun.
Chilli: Oh, that's nice to hear.
Bingo and Bluey: Mum!
Chilli: I brought all the swim stuff you left behind.
Bingo and Bluey: Yeah!
Bandit: Oobubbakaayo...
(The scene changes to the family eating, and then putting the kids swimsuits.)

Bluey: Yes!

Bluey: Yeah!
(The scene changes to the bottom of the pool and the sinkie falling to the bottom. Bluey then takes the sinkie and swims up to the surface)

Bandit: Okay, ready for the torpedo?
Bingo and Bluey: Ready!
(Bandit goes under the water and pushes off the wall)

Bingo: Um, something about... Ballet Class
