The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. Bingo, Chilli, and Bluey are in the sunroom, looking hot and tired. Bingo is sitting down with a book. Chilli is lying down and fanning herself with a leaflet from the Golden Crown. Bluey is standing in front of a fan.
Bingo: It's hot...
Chilli: Oh, it's so hot...
Bluey: (talking into the fan, robotically) Mum, what are we doing today?
Chilli: (robotically) Nothing until you've cleaned your teeth.
Bluey: (robotically) But I don't want to clean my teeth. It's boring.
Chilli: (robotically) Boring things are still important.
Bluey: (robotically) No, they're not.
Chilli: (robotically) You sound like your dad!
Bandit enters, carrying some pool noodles and a water pistol.
Bandit: Hey, squirts! Uncle Stripe said we could use his pool while he's in Bali.
Bingo and Bluey: Yeah!
Bandit: (talking into the fan, robotically) Let's get out of here.
Bingo and Bluey giggle and run off.
Chilli: Make sure you take all the swimming stuff!
Bandit: Yeah, yeah, we got it covered.
Chilli: Don't just get the fun stuff. I mean, the bag of stuff.
Bandit: Boring!
Bluey runs back into the room.
Bluey: Yeah, boring!
Bandit shoots a water gun at Chilli.
Chilli: Aaah! Hey!
Chilli laughs as Bandit and the kids run out of the house.
Chilli: That's nice and cool, actually.
TITLE CARD - The Pool
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called The Pool.
Bandit is driving the car with the kids and the pool noodles in the back.
Bluey: Mum is such a fusspot, isn't she?
Bandit: She is.
Bluey: Mum always makes us do so many boring things.
Bandit: She does.
Bluey: Dad is way more fun.
Bandit: I am.
Bingo: Dad, what does a-a-a-a-a-b-b-b-u-u-u-u-u-u-k-k-k-k-k-k-j-j-k-k-k spell?
Bandit: Oobubbakakayo.
Bingo giggles. The gang arrives at Uncle Stripe's house. Bluey jumps out of the car, lands on the pavement, and starts hopping about. Bandit walks around the front of the car, wearing his thongs.
Bluey: Ee, ow, ooh, ow! It's hot!
Bluey jumps back inside the car.
Bandit: Well, stick your thongs on.
Bluey: I didn't bring them!
Bandit: Ahh. Okay. Umm, how are we gonna do this?
The scene changes to Bandit walking to the pool while carrying Bluey in one arm, the pool noodles in his other arm, and Bingo on his head. Bingo grabs some leaves from an overhead branch, yanking Bandit's head back until the leaves break off.
Bandit: Ow, ow, ow! Hey, Bingo, what's going on up there?
Bingo: I'm a giraffe! And I'm eating these leaves!
They reach the pool, surrounded by a glass fence with a bolted gate. Bingo lets go of Bluey. She runs up to the gate and jumps onto it.
Bluey: Can someone open this gate!
Bandit bites the bolt with his teeth, pulls it up, and kicks the gate open (with Bluey still hanging onto it). It swings back and bolts itself. Bluey laughs and Bandit lets out a sigh. The scene changes to the kids excitedly running onto the pool area, with Bandit following.
Bluey: Can I have my rashie?
Bandit: Did you bring it?
Bluey: No.
Bandit: Then no.
Bingo: Dad, did we bring sunscreen?
Bandit: Uhh, no, I didn't...
Bluey: It's okay. We don't need sunscreen.
Bandit: Yes, we do. We'll just have to stay in the shady bit, and we'll put our hats on.
Bluey: What hats?
Bandit facepalms. The scene changes to a shot from inside the pool, looking upwards. Bluey walks up to the pool's edge and looks into the water. The scene changes again to Bluey and Bingo by the pool.
Bluey: Hey, Bingo, check it out!
Bluey does a spinning jump into the pool holding her breath underwater. Bingo dances on the spot in excitement.
Bingo: My turn!
Bingo is about to jump in when she notices the pool cleaner in the pool. She gasps. Bandit walks up to her.
Bingo: Can you take that out?
Bandit: Nah, it keeps the pool clean, kiddo.
Bingo: Can I have my floaties?
Bandit: I didn't bring 'em.
Bingo: What?!
Bandit: Um...
Bandit looks around. We then see him carrying Bingo towards the shallow steps of the pool.
Bandit: You'll have to stay on the shallow steps, Bin.
Bandit puts Bingo into the water.
Bingo: Aww.
Bingo notices the pool cleaner again.
Bingo: But I won't be able to swim away from the crawly thing.
The camera changes view to show Bluey treading water in the shady section of the pool.
Bluey: Dad, do you think I can swim from this side to that side all by myself?
Bandit: Yeah, you definitely could.
Bluey: No, you have to pretend that you don't think I could.
Bandit: Oh, I mean... no way! No one can swim THAT far!
Bluey: Watch this!
Bluey starts swimming towards the opposite end of the pool, which is in direct sunlight.
Bandit: Oh, hey kiddo, sorry, not into the sunny bit. You've got no sunscreen on.
Bluey: Aww.
Bluey takes a deep breath, dives underwater and swims back up.
Bandit: You'll be all right. Now, let's chill some beans!
Bandit cannonballs into the pool, holding his breath underwater, and splashes Bluey, who giggles. The scene changes to Bandit holding a pool noodle horizontally while inside the pool and Bluey standing outside on the pool edge.
Bluey: Higher.
Bandit raises the noodle slightly.
Bluey: Higher!
Bandit raises the noodle further.
Bluey: Lower!
Bandit lowers the noodle slightly.
Bluey: Okay!
She jumps over the noodle and cannonballs into the pool, holding her breath underwater, and splashing Bandit. She emerges and starts rubbing her eyes as Bandit holds is breath with his mouth underwater.
Bluey: The water's making my eyes stingy!
Bandit: Yeah, that's the chlorine. Did you bring your goggles?
Bluey: No.
Bandit: Ah. Okay, well, we'll just have to play above-the-water games, kid.
Bluey: But I want to dive down and get the sinkies.
Bandit: Did you bring the sinkies?
Bluey: No.
Bandit: Well, that solves that, then.
Bandit leans back and relaxes in the water.
Bluey: Aww.
Bingo: Aah!
The scene changes to show Bingo in the shallow section. The pool cleaner is slowly floating towards her.
Bingo: Dad! Aah!
Bandit wades over and swats the pool cleaner away.
Bingo: (angry) I... want... my... floaties!
Bluey emerges from the water again.
Bluey: Dad, is the shady bit gonna get bigger or smaller?
Bandit: Uh... bigger for sure.
The scene changes to show Bandit and the kids sitting in the shallow bit of the pool, which is now the only part of the pool in the shade.
Bandit: Uh, I meant smaller.
Bluey: I'm bored.
Bandit: (waving) Hi, Bored! Nice to meet you!
Bluey makes a frustrated noise.
Bingo: I'm hungry.
Bandit: Oh, hello, Hungry! This is Bored!
Bingo makes a small growl.
Bandit: Ooh, tough crowd.
Bingo: I want some food.
Bandit: Aw, yeah, it's morning tea time!
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!
Bandit: But I didn't bring any food.
Bluey and Bingo: Aww.
Bandit: You know what, kids? I think we might be done.
Bluey and Bandit get out of the pool. Bingo grabs onto the pool steps.
Bingo: No! I don't wanna get out!
Bandit shakes himself dry.
Bandit: Come on, Bingo!
Bluey: (shivering) I'm coooold!
Bandit: Well, grab your towel, kid.
Bluey: I didn't bring one!
Bandit: Just shake!
Bluey: I haven't learned how to shake yet!
Bandit tries to get Bingo out of the pool, who is now clinging onto the steps.
Bandit: Come ON!
Bingo: No, I don't wanna get out!
Bluey attempts to shake herself dry.
Bingo: I'm staying in the pool!
Bluey: (still trying to shake) I can't shake properly!
Bandit: Bluey, give us a hand with your sister.
Bingo: I'm never getting out of this...
Bingo notices the pool cleaner floating towards her again. She screams, jumps out of the pool, and lands on Bandit's shoulder. He puts her down.
Bingo: (shivering) Dad, I'm cold!
Bluey: (shivering) Dad, I'm freezing!
Bingo: Dad, I'm hungry!
Bluey: Dad, I'm starving!
Bingo: Dad!
Bluey: Dad!
Bingo: Dad!
Bluey: DAD!
Bandit: Okay! Can everyone stop saying "Dad"?
Bluey: I think Dad is actually boring. Mum is way more fun.
Chilli: Oh, that's nice to hear!
The view changes to show Chilli arriving at the pool, carrying a bag. Bluey and Bingo run to the gate.
Bluey and Bingo: Mum!
Chilli: I brought all the swim stuff you left behind!
Bluey and Bingo:Yeah!
Bandit: Oobubbakaayo...
A montage begins, showing the family eating together in a gazebo. We then see Chilli putting sunscreen onto Bluey's tummy and Bandit helping Bingo, now wearing goggles and a rashie, with putting her floaties on. The scene changes to a shot from inside the pool and looking upwards, as Bingo, Bluey (who is also wearing goggles and her rashie), and Chilli walk towards the edge.
Chilli: So, boring things are important sometimes, then?
Bluey: Yes!
Bandit joins them and holds up a small plastic seahorse.
Bandit: Mum brought the sinkies!
Bluey: Yeah!
The scene changes to the bottom of the pool and the sinkie falling down to the ground. Bluey dives down, holding her breath, picks up the sinkie and swims up to the surface where Bingo is splashing with delight.
Bluey: Got it!
In the next scene, the family is sitting near the bottom of the pool, holding their breaths and pretending that they are drinking tea, bubbles blowing from their noses. The scene changes to Bluey and Bingo holding onto Bandit.
Bandit: Okay, ready for the torpedo?
Bingo and Bluey: Ready!
Bandit Bluey and Bingo take a deep breath and Bandit sinks under the water with them and pushes off the wall. The scene changes to Bingo on the shallow steps with the pool cleaner slowing moving towards her. She jumps into the water.
Bingo: You can't get me, crawly thing! Ha ha!
Bingo swims off. We then see Bluey trying to say something to Bingo while underwater. She then emerges after holding her breath.
Bluey: What did I say?
Bingo: Um, something about... ballet class?
The scene changes to show Bandit in the pool and Chilli lying inside an inflatable ring that resembles a donut, floating towards him. They both open their eyes and look at each other. We then see Bluey holding her breath and swimming at the bottom of the pool, picking up dive rings. Blowing bubbles from her nose. she looks up and sees her parents on the surface, as they hold hands and bring their noses together. Bluey smiles and her tail gently wags.
The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a happy electronic piece. Bluey is dancing.
