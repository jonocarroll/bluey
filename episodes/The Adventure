The episode opens to an exterior view of the Glasshouse Primary School. The aspect ratio changes from the usual 16:9 ratio to a cinematic aspect ratio.
Bluey (as the Kindly Queen): "Oh another electricity bill. How will I afford to feed all these babies? Princess?"
Chloe walks into frame carrying a baby doll, dressed like a princess.
Chloe: "Yes, Kindly Queen?"
Bluey: "I'm afraid you're gonna have to leave home and find food for us all."
Chloe: "(gasps) But i'm much too scared to travel in the outside world. Please, don't make me leave!"
Bluey: "I'm sorry, you have to, or we'll all starve."
Bluey and Chloe hug somberly.
Bluey: "I'll miss you ever so much!"
Chloe: "As will I, Kindly Queen."
Chloe walk off frame as Bluey looks on sadly.
Bluey: (imitating a baby's cry) "Waah, Waah!"
The scene cuts to Chloe finishing tying up a bindle as Bluey, on all fours with a saddle on her back and bridle in her mouth, walks/crawls into frame, imitating horse neighing.
Chloe pets Bluey.
Chloe: "Oh, Honeyhorse, my oldest friend. Whatever shall we do? Wherever shall we go?"
Bluey/Honeyhorse neighs.
Chloe: "Great idea! We will travel to the farm where I was born. They will have plenty of food for everyone!"
Bluey: (suddenly out of character) "Hooray!"
Chloe: "Honeyhorse can't talk, remember? He just neighs."
Bluey: "Oh, yeah. "
Bluey gets back into character, and neighs.
TITLE CARD: The Adventure
Bluey: (voiceover) "This episode of Bluey is called The Adventure."
Chloe, riding Bluey, comes out of the front door of the school, as adventurous music plays.
The Terriers peek out from behind a nearby rock.
Chloe: "Oh, my, Honeyhorse, I'm not sure about this."
The Terriers suddenly jump out from behind the rock, making fart noises with their armpits.
Terriers: "Hut!"
Chloe: "Aah!"
Bluey/Honeyhorse neighs.
The Terriers continue making armpit farts.
Chloe: "Oh, my, what rude fellows."
Terriers: (copying Chloe) "Oh, my, what rude fellows!"
Chloe: "Stop copying me this instant!"
Terriers: (copying Chloe, again) "Stop copying me this instant."
Chloe: Dah, silly terriers!
Terriers: "Boys are strong, like King Kong! Girls are weak! Chuck 'em in the creek!"
The Terriers laugh and point at Chloe and Bluey.
Terriers: "Huh!"
The Terriers start making armpit farts again.
Bluey makes a sound as she spits out the bridle in her mouth. 
Bluey: "Pbht! Chloe, let me be the princess for a second. I've got an idea."
Chloe: "Okay."
Bluey and Chloe quickly swap costumes, with Chloe being Honeyhorse and Bluey the princess. Bluey gets ontop of Chloe.
Bluey: "Ahem!"
Terriers: "Huh?"
Bluey: "Girls are strong like King Kong. Boys are weak. Chuck them into the creek!"
The Terriers gasp as they turn away and start whispering something amongst themselves.
Terrier (black and white one): "You've beaten us, my princess."
Terrier (light grey one): "When you need us, we'll be there."
Bluey: "Why, thank you."
Chloe/Honeyhorse neighs.
Bluey and Chloe walk off screen as the scene cuts to them walking towards the sand pit.
Bluey: "We're here! This is the farm where I grew up. It will have lots of food for the Kindly Queen's babies."
Bluey starts running towards the sandpit/farm.
Bluey: "Oh, my! It's all gone!"
She walks in the middle of the sandpit.
Bluey: "This was once full of fruit bushes. What's happened?"
Chloe (dressed as a fairy): "The Greedy Queen turned it all to sand, my dear princess."
Bluey: "Grandma Fairy, it's you!"
Bluey and Chloe quickly hug.
Chloe: "Yes, it's me!"
Bluey: "Why did the Greedy Queen turn all the fruit bushes into sand?"
Chloe: "Maybe she really likes sand."
Bluey: "Someone has to stop her or there'll be no food!"
Chloe: "What about you?"
Bluey: "Me? I'm not brave enough."
Chloe: You are, too! You have the heart of a hero, my princess. Here, take this treasure. 
Chloe brings out a tennis ball and extends her arm to give it to Bluey, a detailed close-up of the ball is shown.
Chloe: "It's really magic. It can help you beat the Greedy Queen."
Bluey: "I'm sorry. I'm just too frightened. I have to ride home at once!" 
Bluey runs off screen
Bluey: "Honeyhorse, where are you?"
Scene cuts to the sandpit, Bluey is Honeyhorse again, neighing.
Chloe, dressed as the Greedy Queen carrying a stick with a dried orange on top to act as a wand, suddenly jumps into frame.
Chloe: "Ha-ha-ha-haaa! I'm the Greedy Queen and i'm going to freeze you!"
Bluey/Honeyhorse starts backing up with her ears down, acting scared.
Chloe: "Freeze!"
Bluey/Honeyhorse shrieks as she extends an arm and a leg and stays very still to act like she is frozen.
Chloe: (running away to off-screen) "Ha-ha-ha-haaa!"
Chloe re-enters the scene, dressed like the princess again.
Chloe: "Honeyhorse! Oh, no! Honeyhorse, my dearest friend! The Greedy Queen has turned you to stone. Well."
The camera switches to a front-view of Chloe.
Chloe: "I'm gonna make her turn you back to not-stone!"
Chloe raises her right arm, with her hand in a fist, determinately as the wind blows the trees behind her.
Encouraging music plays as Chloe walks along a path, carrying her bindle.
Scene cuts to Chloe, now walking in a garden full of garden gnomes, she gasps.
Chloe: "The Greedy Queen has frozen all the villagers!"
Bluey enters the scene, dressed as the Greedy Queen.
Bluey: (gruff voice) "And I'll freeze you, too!"
Chloe: (gasps)
Bluey: "Freeze!"
Chloe: "Waah!"
Chloe avoids being turned to stone by diving behind a nearby wheelbarrow full of dirt.
Bluey: "You can't hide from me, dearie! I am too powerful for a little princess."
Chloe: "If you keep being mean and greedy, no one will want to be your friend!"
Bluey: "I don't want any friends! I like being mean and greedy!"
Bluey is slowly walking towards the wheelbarrow, with a front-view camera angle.
Chloe: "Oh, I'm not brave enough to do this."
Bluey jumps out and surprises Chloe.
Bluey: "Yaaah!"
Chloe: "Aah! Help!"
Bluey: "No one can help you now!"
Bluey raises her wand, preparing to freeze Chloe.
Terriers: (off-screen) "You want to bet?! Yaaah!"
The Terriers start making armpit farts at Bluey to distract her.
Bluey: "Argh! Get away, you stinky boys!"
Terrier (dark grey one): "Run, princess!"
Chloe: (while running) "Aaaaah! Thank you, brave ones!"
Terriers: "Protect the princess!"
Chloe starts running down a semi-steep hill.
Bluey: (off-screen) "Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Yaaah!"
Chloe: (gasps)
Bluey: "I'm coming to get you! (Bluey flicks her wand as it makes a twinkling sound)"
Chloe: "Oh, no!"
Chloe drops her bindle, out of breath from running.
Chloe: (exhales) "You're a faster runner than me, Bluey! Let's swap."
Bluey: (normal voice) "Okay."
Bluey and Chloe swap costumes.
Bluey (now the princess, running): "Yaaah!"
Chloe (now the Greedy Queen): "Ha-ha-ha-haaa!"
Bluey continues running as she approaches a small man-made stream, stopping and dropping her bindle. Calypso is sitting in the background, knitting, with Bentley to her right and Zara to her left.
Bluey: "Oh, there's no way across! I'm doooooomed!"
Chloe: (off-screen) "Princess!"
Bluey: "Huh?"
The scene zooms-out to show Chloe dressed as Fairy Grandma.
Bluey: "Fairy Grandma!"
Chloe: "Oh, my dearie, you have to stand up to that Greedy Queen or you'll be frozen forever."
Bluey: "No, but I can't. I'm just a scared little princess."
Chloe: "But you don't have to be. You can change into anything you want."
Bluey: "Can I?"
Chloe: "Yes, you can."
Chloe brings out the tennis ball from earlier. Bluey briefly looks at it and takes it from Chloe's hand.
Chloe: "I have to go now, my child."
Bluey: Wait, no!
Chloe: "Remember the treasuuure! (imitating a fading voice) Treasure, treasure, treasure..." 
Bluey: (whimpering) "Ohh."
Chloe emerges from a nearby rock, dressed as the Greedy Queen again.
Chloe: "Haha, there you are!"
Bluey: (in a scared voice) "Ohhhh!"
Chloe: "Thought you could get away from me, did you? Ha-ha-ha-haaa!"
Bluey winces but then looks at the tennis ball in her hand then away, as if thinking.
Bluey: "Turn Honeyhorse back to not-stone, or else!"
Chloe: "Or else what, my little princess?"
Bluey: "Or else I'll turn ùò∫ùò∞ùò∂ to stone!"
Chloe: "Ha! Oh my! I'd like to see that! Ha-ha-ha-haaa!"
Bluey hold up the tennis ball with a determined look on her face as a twinkle sound plays.
Chloe: "Ooh, I'm scared!"
Bluey: "Go get it!"
Bluey throws the tennis ball.
Chloe: "Wah!"
Chloe chases after the tennis ball, catching it with her mouth. Chloe looks back towards Bluey.
Bluey walks towards the Greedy Queen's wand and picks it up as a twinkle sound plays. Chloe spits out the tennis ball.
Chloe: "Pah! Uh, whoops!"
Bluey points the wand towards Chloe.
Bluey: "Freeze!"
Chloe screams as the scene switched to trees, where the screaming scares off crows in the trees.
Scene then switches back to the Terriers, being unfrozen mid armpit fart.
Terriers: "Yeah!"
Terrier (black and white one): "You did it, princess!"
Terrier (light grey one): "You beat the Greedy Queen!"
Bluey enters the scene, as Honeyhorse again
Bluey/Honeyhorse neighs.
Chloe: "Oh, Honeyhorse, my dearest friend. We did it!"
Bluey/Honeyhorse neighs.
All: Hooray!
Everybody starts laughing, with Bluey still neighing. Scene fades to the inside of the school with a constellation on a paper resembling Bluey as Honeyhorse.
Chloe: "More tea and cakes for your children, Kindly Queen?"
Bluey (as the Kindly Queen): "Oh, they couldn't eat another bite, thanks to you, brave princess."
Scene switches to a slow fading zoom-out of the front of Glasshouse Primary. The aspect ratio returns to a normal 16:9. After a moment, it fades out.
Fading in to Chloe, now in her dad's car, looking out one of the windows.
Frank: "What'd you get up to at school today, Chloe?"
Chloe: "Um...not much. Bluey and I played princesses."
Frank: "Oh, princesses, eh? Oh, is that where you sit in a castle and have tea and cakes?"
Chloe gets a shocked look on her face that changes to a mischievous look as she slowly raises the Greedy Queen's wand.
Chloe: "Freeze!"
Frank: "Aah!"
