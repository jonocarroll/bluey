Bluey (dressed as a queen): Oh another electricity bill. How will I afford to feed all these babies? Princess? 
Chloe: Yes, Kindly Queen?
Bluey: I'm afraid you're gonna have to leave home and find food for us all.
Chloe: But i'm much too scared to travel in the outside world. Please, don't make me leave!
Bluey: I'm sorry, you have to, or we'll all starve. I'll miss you ever so much!
Chloe: As will I, Kindly Queen.
 Bluey: Waah, Waah!
Bluey: 
Chloe: Oh, Honeyhorse, my oldest friend. Whatever shall we do? Wherever shall we go?
Bluey/Honeyhorse: 
Chloe: Great idea! We will travel to the farm where I was born. They will have plenty of food for everyone!
Bluey, suddenly out of character: Hooray!
Chloe: Honeyhorse can't talk, remember? He just neighs.
Bluey: Oh, yeah. 
: This episode of Bluey is called The Adventure.
Chloe: Oh, my, Honeyhorse, I'm not sure about this.
Terriers: Hut!
Chloe: Aah!
Bluey/Honeyhorse: 
Chloe: Oh, my, what rude fellows.
Terriers: Oh, my, what rude fellows!
Chloe: Stop copying me this instant!
Terriers: Stop copying me this instant.
Chloe: Dah, silly terriers!
Terriers: Boys are strong, like King Kong! Girls are weak! Chuck 'em in the creek!
Terriers: Huh! 
Bluey: Pbht! Chloe, let me be the princess for a second. I've got an idea.
Chloe: Okay. 
Bluey: Ahem!
Terriers: Huh?
Bluey: Girls are strong like King Kong. Boys are weak. Chuck ùòµùò©ùò¶ùòÆ into the creek!
Terrier (the black and white one): You've beaten us, my princess. 
Terrier (light grey one): When you need us, we'll be there. 
Bluey: Why, thank you.
Chloe/Honeyhorse: Neeeigh!
Bluey: We're here! This is the farm where I grew up. It will have lots of food for the Kindly Queen's babies. 
Bluey: Oh, my! It's all gone! This was once full of fruit bushes. What's happened?
Chloe, dressed as a fairy: The Greedy Queen turned it all to sand, my dear princess. 
Bluey: Grandma Fairy, it's you! 
Chloe: Yes, it's me!
Bluey: Why did the Greedy Queen turn all the fruit bushes into sand? 
Chloe: Maybe she really likes sand. 
Bluey: Someone has to stop her or there'll be no food!
Chloe: What about you?
Bluey: Me? I'm not brave enough.
Chloe: You are, too! You have the heart of a hero, my princess. Here, take this treasure. It's really magic. It can help you beat the Greedy Queen. 
Bluey: I'm sorry. I'm just too frightened. I have to ride home at once! 
Bluey: Honeyhorse, where are you? 
Bluey: 
Chloe: Ha-ha-ha-haaa! I'm the Greedy Queen and i'm going to freeze you! 
Chloe: Freeze!
Bluey: Aah! 
Chloe: Ha-ha-ha-haaa!
Chloe: Honeyhorse! Oh, no! Honeyhorse, my dearest friend! The Greedy Queen has turned you to stone. Well, I'm gonna make her turn you back to not-stone! 
Chloe: The Greedy Queen has frozen all the villagers!
Bluey: And I'll freeze you, too!
Chloe: 
Bluey: Freeze!
Chloe: Waah! 
Bluey: You can't hide from me, dearie! I am too powerful for a little princess.
Chloe: If you keep being mean and greedy, no one will want to be your friend! 
Bluey: I don't want any friends! I like being mean and greedy! 
Chloe: Oh, I'm not brave enough to do this.
Bluey: Yaaah!
Chloe: Aah! Help! 
Bluey: No one can help you now! 
Terriers, off-screen: You want to bet?! Yaaah! 
Bluey: Argh! Get away, you stinky boys!
Terrier (dark grey one): Run, princess!
Chloe, while running: Aaaaah! Thank you, brave ones!
Terriers: Protect the princess!
Bluey, off-screen: Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Yaaah!
Chloe: 
Bluey: I'm coming to get you! 
Chloe: Oh, no!
Chloe: You're a faster runner than me, Bluey! Let's swap.
Bluey: Okay.
Bluey, now the princess: *Running* Yaaah!
Chloe, now the Greedy Queen: Ha-ha-ha-haaa!
Bluey: Oh, there's no way across! I'm doooooomed!
Chloe, off-screen: Princess!
Bluey: Huh? Fairy Grandma!
Chloe: Oh, my dearie, you have to stand up to that Greedy Queen or you'll be frozen forever.
Bluey: No, but I can't. I'm just a scared little princess.
Chloe: But you don't have to be. You can change into anything you want. 
Bluey: Can I?
Chloe: Yes, you can.
Chloe: I have to go now, my child.
Bluey: Wait, no!
Chloe: Remember the treasuuure! Treasure, treasure, treasure... 
Bluey: Ohh.
Chloe: Haha, there you are!
Bluey, in a scared voice: Ohhhh!
Chloe: Thought you could get away from me, did you? Ha-ha-ha-haaa!
Bluey: Turn Honeyhorse back to not-stone, or else!
Chloe: Or else what, my little princess?
Bluey: Or else I'll turn ùò∫ùò∞ùò∂ to stone!
Chloe: Ha! Oh my! I'd like to see that! Ha-ha-ha-haaa!
Chloe: Ooh, I'm scared!
Bluey: Go get it! 
Chloe: Wah! 
 
Chloe: Pah! Uh, whoops!
Terriers: Yeah! 
Terrier (Black and white one): You did it, princess!
Terrier (light grey one): You beat the Greedy Queen!
Bluey: 
Chloe: Oh, Honeyhorse, my dearest friend. We did it!
Bluey: 
All: Hooray!
Chloe: More tea and cakes for your children, Kindly Queen?
Bluey, as the Kindly Queen: Oh, they couldn't eat another bite, thanks to you, brave princess.
Frank (Chloe's dad): What'd you get up to at school today, Chloe?
Chloe: Um...not much. Bluey and I played princesses. 
Frank: Oh, princesses, eh? Oh, is that where you sit in a castle and have tea and cakes?
Chloe: Freeze!
Frank: Aah!
