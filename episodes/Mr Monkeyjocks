The episode opens with a brief establishing shot of the Heelers' house. It's daytime.
The scene cuts to the playroom. Toys are strewn everywhere, even the roof of the play house. Bluey is sitting at a low table, circling items in a toy catalog.
Bluey Ooh, yeah, I want that one. And that one.
The scene cuts to a first-person view of the catalog. She has circled a teddy bear crying rainbows, a bear in a top hat, and a moonlight unicorse. She circles a sleeping cat with a red marker.
Bluey: Ooh, I definitely want that one.
She circles a pair of dolls wearing a banana an pineapple costume.
The scene cuts back to third person.
Bandit: (offscreen) Kids, can you not leave all your stuff everywhere?
Bandit enters, carrying some toys under his arm. He steps on an echidna squeaky toy.
Bandit: Ow! (wincing) Biscuits. 
Bingo walks in, listlessly.
Bingo: I'm bored.
Bandit: How can you be bored when you've got this many toys?
Bandit gestures around the room, then dumps his armful of toys in a basket. Bluey holds up the catalog.
Bluey: Dad, can you buy me this Tommy Teddy, this Starlight Unicorse, and... this Rainbow Boobear?
Bandit: No. You kids have got too many toys.
Bandit picks up the basket of toys and carries it to the cupboard.
Bluey What? We've hardly got any.
Bandit opens the cupboard door, and is buried in an avalanche of toys.
Bandit: Ahh!
A wind up doll activates, and repeatedly bumps into the side of Bandit's head.
Doll: I love you, Mama!
Bandit: That's it! We're having a chuck-out.
TITLE CARD - Mr Monkeyjocks
Bluey : This episode of Bluey is called Mr. Monkeyjocks.
The episode resumes in the playroom. Bandit, Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli stand next to a pile of toys higher than Bandit and a pair of empty baskets. Bandit points at one basket and then the other.
Bandit: Okay, one basket for keeping and one basket for chucking.
Bingo: No!
Chilli: But we keep all the special toys, and nothing's going in the bin. It's all going to needy kids.
Bluey: But we're needy kids!
Bandit: You're spoilt kids.
Bluey: (offended) No, we're not! Wait, what does that mean?
Chilli: Focus, Heelers.
Bandit grabs an owl plushie from the pile.
Bandit: Right, first customer. Chuck.
Bandit tosses the owl into the 'chuck' basket.
Bluey: Ahhhh!
Bluey grabs the owl out of the basket.
Bluey: No, Snowy's special. Keep, keep!
She puts the owl in the 'keep' basket.
Bandit sighs and grabs a monkey wearing a tuxedo from the pile.
Bandit: Chuck.
He tosses the monkey into the 'chuck' basket.
Bingo: Ahhhh!
Bingo grabs the monkey out of the basket and hugs it.
Bingo: Chutney Chimp's special. The Bottle Fairy brought me him.
Bandit: Not everything can be special. That's not how that word works.
Bandit grabs a pink dog doll from the pile. He tosses it towards the 'chuck' basket. Chilli grabs it out of the air.
Chilli: Ahh! Not Lady Sparklehound!
Bandit rolls his eyes.
Bandit: Oh, we're off to a great start.
The shot changes to an overhead view of the contents of the two baskets. In time lapse, we see more and more toys added to the 'keep' basket. A banana and a giraffe man briefly appear in the 'chuck' basket before being moved to the 'keep' basket. The shot changes to the pile of toys, which shrinks down to nothing.
Bandit: Okay, so in the keep basket is... everything.
Bandit pulls the only toy out of the 'chuck' basket - a green- and orange-striped sock monkey wearing jocks.
Bandit: And in the 'chuck' basket is a monkey wearing jocks.
A few notes of friction drum play, suggesting both a sad trombone and a monkey's call. Bingo grabs the toy and hugs it.
Bingo: Mr. Monkeyjocks!
Bluey: We can't chuck Mr. Monkeyjocks.
Bandit: (incredulous) But you never play with him.
Bluey: We do!
Bingo: He's special.
Bandit folds his arms.
Bandit: Well, you'd better show me he's special if you wanna keep him.
Bluey and Bingo: Okay.
Bluey and Bingo giggle and run off.
Chilli: You'll probably regret that.
The scene cuts to Bandit walking down the front path to get the newspaper. Bluey ducks under his legs and snatches it first.
Bluey: Yoink!
Bandit: Hey!
Bluey runs off with it. The scene cuts to Mr. Monkeyjocks laying on the couch, reading the paper. Bluey and Bingo giggle. Bandit stomps into the room.
Bandit: Grrr!
The scene cuts to the dining room table. Bingo, Bluey, and Chilli are already seated. Bandit comes in with a skillet of eggs, bacon, and sausage. He sets it down on the table.
Bandit: Breakfast! I'll just take my seat.
The camera pans over - Mr. Monkeyjocks is already sitting in Bandit's seat. Bingo giggles, Chilli tries not to laugh.
Bandit: Hey! That monkey's in my chair!
Bluey: It's his chair now.
Bingo giggles again.
Bandit: Well, where am I supposed to sit?
The scene cuts to Bandit, sitting on the floor, stabbing at a sausage.
Bandit: Is there any more bacon?
The scene cuts back to show the whole table. Mr. Monkeyjocks has a plate of food.
Bluey: Only for special people.
Bluey puts the last piece of bacon on Mr. Monkeyjocks' plate.
Bluey: Not you, floor boy.
Bandit: Floor boy?!
Bingo laughs.
Bluey: More maple syrup, Mr. Monkeyjocks?
Bingo: (as Mr. Monkeyjocks) Don't mind if I do.
Bandit: (muttering) Getting sick of this monkey.
A brief montage begins. The car is driving down the road. We can see Bingo's head bobbing. The scene cuts to the interior of the car. Bluey and Bingo are bobbing their heads to the music, and making Mr. Monkeyjocks bob along with them. Bandit looks at them in the rear-view mirror, then tries to ignore them.
The car arrives at a strip mall, in front of a store labeled "Space". The scene cuts to the interior - it's an indoor playground. Bluey and Bingo are having Mr. Monkeyjocks operate a ball cannon. Bingo squeals with delight.
The scene cuts to the lower level of the playground - Bandit is running in circles trying to dodge balls.
Bandit: Arggh! Ow!
The scene cuts back to the car, driving the other way. Bandit is letting Mr. Monkeyjocks "drive".
Bandit: Look out!
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: Turn! Turn! Red lights!
The scene cuts to Mr. Monkeyjocks, lounging in the wicker chair in the sunroom, wearing a pair of sunnies. Bluey presents him with a fancy drink, while Bingo massages his feet. Bandit enters.
Bandit: Has anyone seen my... sunnies.
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: Okay, kids. This has gone a bit far.
Bluey: (singsong) You said we have to treat him special.
Bandit: Chilli!
Chilli: Oh, come here, .
Bandit reaches out for a hug.
Bandit: Babe, can you please helpâ€” Huh?
Chilli walks right past Bandit and hugs Mr. Monkeyjocks.
Chilli: (saccharine) How's my little monkey man?
Bandit: Hey, mate! That's my wife!
Bluey: Not anymore! Mum married Mr. Monkeyjocks.
Bandit: What?!
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: When did this happen?!
Chilli: I was going to tell you.
Bandit: You left me for a monkey?!
Chilli: I'm sorry, honey. There's just something... special about him.
Bluey pantomimes kissing Mr. Monkeyjocks several times.
Bandit: Well, what am I supposed to do?
Bluey holds Mr. Monkeyjocks to her ear.
Bluey: Ooh, what's that? Oh, yes, good idea. You can be his monkey butler.
Bandit: What?!
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: Mm. Actually, I'd love to.
Bandit picks up Mr. Monkeyjocks and holds him to his ear.
Bandit: How may I be of service, sir? Yes sir. Right away.
Bandit carries Mr. Monkeyjocks out of the room, chuckling to himself.
Chilli: You're probably gonna regret that.
The scene cuts to Bluey and Bingo's bedroom. Mr. Monkeyjocks is reclining on the ledge. Bandit is stripping the bedclothes off of Bluey's bed. Bluey and Bingo walk in.
Bluey: Hey, what's going on?
Bandit shakes out a new bed cover in a banana pattern.
Bandit: Mr. Monkeyjocks doesn't want bones on his bed. He wants bananas.
Bandit begins making the bed.
Bluey: His bed? That's not his bed. It's my bed.
Bandit: Not anymore. This is his room now.
Bandit dumps the old bedclothes in Bluey's arms and throws Bluey and Bingo out into the hall.
Bandit: See ya!
He slams the bedroom door behind them.
Bluey: Outrageous!
The scene cuts to the office. Bandit has set up a mirror, and has dressed Mr. Monkeyjocks in Chutney Chimp's tux and Lady Sparklehound's hat in addition to Bandit's sunnies. Bandit has a pencil tucked behind his ear and is wearing a measuring tape in the fashion of a tailor. Chutney Chimp and Lady Sparklehound lie discarded on the floor. Bluey and Bingo enter.
Bandit: I'll just take the waist in.
Bingo picks up Chutney Chimp and Bluey picks up Lady Sparklehound.
Bingo: Hey, that's Chutney Chimp's suit.
Bluey: And Lady Sparklehound's hat.
Bandit: Hey, he said he wanted 'em.
Bluey: But you can't give him stuff just because he says he wants it.
Bandit: Look, I'm just the butler. If you have a problem, take it up with the monkey.
Bluey: Oh, I will, alright.
Bluey stomps across the room to confront Mr. Monkeyjocks.
Bluey: Listen, mate, I think it's time for a certain someone to find somewhere else to live.
The scene cuts to Bluey and Bingo on the front porch, each holding a bag. Bandit slams the door in their faces.
Bluey: I didn't mean us!
The scene cuts to the foyer. Bandit makes Mr. Monkeyjocks dust his hands.
Bandit: That was harsh, but fair, sir.
Chilli enters.
Chilli: Aren't you being a little unfair, my sweet monkey man?
She strokes Mr. Monkeyjock's cheek. The scene cuts to a closeup of Mr. Monkeyjocks.
The scene cuts to Chilli on the front porch, with a pair of suitcases. Bandit slams the door in her face.
Chilli: I thought you loved me!
Chilli walks down the front steps.
Chilli: That is one cheeky monkey.
She takes a seat on the bottom step, next to Bluey and Bingo.
Bluey: How could he just kick us out of our own house?
Bingo: It's very rude.
Chilli: Well, it's kind of our fault. We spoiled him.
Bluey: What does "spoiled" mean?
Chilli: It's a bit hard to explain.
Bingo: Where are we gonna live?
Chilli sighs.
Chilli: Let's ask if we're allowed to sleep in the back yard, shall we?
The scene cuts to the playroom. Mr. Monkeyjocks sits atop a throne of cushions, with a feather boa and crown. A huge pile of toys sits in the 'chuck' basket. Bandit kneels and presents him with a brightly-colored toy horse.
Bandit: (nervously) And what about Pebbledasher? Chuck? Yes, Master Monkeyjocks.
Bandit adds Pebbledasher to the 'chuck' basket.
Chilli: (offscreen) What's going on here?
Bingo, Bluey, and Chilli enter the playroom.
Bandit: Oh, thank goodness you're here.
Bluey: You're chucking all our toys!
Bandit: I'm not. (whispering) He is. He's gone . He says he doesn't want any toys in this house that aren't him.
'Bluey: What?!
Bandit: (whispering) He says he's the only one who can be special.
Chilli: Bluey, that's spoiled.
Bandit adds a plush dog in a birthday hat to the 'chuck' basket.
Bandit: There you go, sir. All the toys have been chucked.
Chilli: How does it feel, Mr. Monkeyjocks?
Mr. Monkeyjocks slumps down.
Bluey: he actually looks a bit bored.
Bingo: How can he be bored? He has everything he wants.
Bluey: Can I listen to him?
Bandit passes Mr. Monkeyjocks to Chilli, who passes him on to Bluey. She holds him up to her ear.
Bluey: Oh! He says he doesn't want everything he wants anymore.
Chilli: Oh. Why ever not?
Bluey passes Mr. Monkeyjocks to Bingo, who holds him up to her ear.
Bingo: Because when you have everything you want... Um, you listen, Mum.
She passes Mr. Monkeyjocks to Chilli, who holds him up to her ear.
Chilli: ... nothing feels special anymore.
Bluey and Bingo: Ohh.
Chilli: Hmm. What do you want to do?
Chilli hands Mr. Monkeyjocks back to Bluey, who holds him to her ear.
Bluey: Oh, you want a turn making someone else feel special?
Chilli: Awww!
Bandit clears his throat.
Chilli: Ooh, sorry.
The scene cuts back to the playroom, with a large pile of toys waiting to be sorted. Bandit picks up the plush owl.
