(Episode starts with Chilli blowing a pale blue balloon)
Chilli: That’s gonna have to do for this one.
Bluey: Thanks Mum!
(Bingo runs into the room with a pink towel, giggling while escaping Bandit)
Bandit: While chasing Bingo; Hey! Come here!
Chilli: Aw Bingo, good girl for having your bath.
Bandit: Yeah but she hasn’t cleaned her teeth!
(Bingo squeals and runs out of the scene with Bandit chasing after her) 
Bandit: Come here!
Chilli: It’s your bath time too Bluey. I can smell you from here!
Bluey: Aw, but I wanted to play Mum School with you.
Chilli: What’s Mum School?
Bluey: It’s a school where you learn to be a mum. (Bluey points to her balloon children)
Bluey: This is Kiwi (red), Windgust (purple), Lightning Bolt (yellow), Dronigan (pink) and that’s Pearl! (pale blue) They’re my children! I gave birth to them all.
Chilli: (reasonably concerned) Oh my goodness… 
Chilli: (looks up at the ceiling, pointing to a green, helium balloon) What about that one?
Bluey: (grabs claw toy, stands on the couch and pulls the green ballon by it’s string) Oh Greeny, you’re such a pickle!
Chilli: Okay, I’m running the bath.
Bluey: No:, not yet! (grabs clipboard) You’re the lady who gives me a score for being a good mum.
Chilli: Oh, you don’t need someone keeping score of your mothering!
(Greeny floats back up to the ceiling)
Bluey: Ah, not again! I’ll get you down. 
(Bluey grabs a cushion and throws it close to Greeny, though it falls back down on the other children balloons, which make them disperse)
Bluey: Ooh! Sorry kids!
Chilli: On second thoughts…
(Title Card Plays):
This episode of Bluey is called Mum School 
(Bluey pushes the couch with the balloon kids sitting on it)
Bluey: Argh! Okay children! Movie time now! Everyone sit up straight. And not on top of each other. Lightning Bolt, please get off Windgust. Okay good.
(Bluey picks up Lightning Bolt, but Greeny floats up, although she catches his string)
Bluey: Agh! Uh Greeny, maybe you should hold Mummy’s hand.
Chilli: Oh, very good. Two points. (writes on clipboard)
Bluey: Okay, movie time! (grabs remote) Which button is it? (Greeny covers Bluey’s view of the remote buttons) Oh! Greeny I’m trying to concentration honey. Hmmm (Greeny repeats his previous action) Oh! Hop over there! 
(Bluey pushes Greeny away, which makes him hit the other resting balloons)
Bluey (as Windgust): Wah! Mummy, Greeny pushed me!
Bluey (normal): Greeny, what has gotten into you? (places him on the couch with a cushion over his head so he doesn’t fly off) Now keep your hands to yourself please young man. 
Bluey (as Windgust again): Na Na! Greeny’s a cushion head! 
Bluey: Windgust! We do not call people cushion head in this house! 
Chilli: Hm! Good mothering.
(Bluey pushes Greeny to Windgust)
Bluey (as Windgust): Wah mama! Greeny hit me!
Bluey: Well, you kinda had that coming.
Chilli: I’m not sure about that.
(Bluey grabs the cushion and throws it on her balloon children, which makes them disperse again)
Bluey: Yah! (giggles, but spots Greeny floating again) Greeny honey, come down from there!
Chilli: I think these kids need some exercise. How about everyone goes for a nice swim in the indoor pool? 
Bluey: Yeah! Come on you lot! (Runs and kicks the balloons to Chilli)
(Meanwhile, it cuts to Bingo still running away from Bandit in the hallway)
Bandit: Come back here and clean your teeth young lady!
Bluey: (while kicking the balloons casually) Come on, come on! This way to the pool! Argh! Walk straight! Ugh, it’s so difficult when they just ignore me! 
Chilli: Yes it is.
Bluey: Why can’t you kids just walk in a straight line? 
Chilli: They don’t know how. You have to show them.
Bluey: (grabs a wrapping paper tube) I’m just gonna show you something kids! (Whacks balloon kids to the bathroom with the tube. Chilli is concerned, but Bluey giggles)
Chilli: I don’t think that’s a good idea.
Bluey: Well I don’t have any other ideas! (whacks Kiwi and Pearl to the bathroom and giggles) Come on Greeny, you’re old enough to walk by yourself.
Chilli: Greeny finds walking a little tricky.
Bluey: Oh nonsense, he’s got two legs. (whacks Greeny with the tube, though Greeny still tries to fly up) This way! No no, stay down. (giggles) I don’t understand why you keep running off!
Chilli: I don’t think he can help it.
(Scene cuts to the bathroom, with all the balloons in the tub except for Greeny, who’s under the laundry basket)
Bluey: Okay! That’s everyone in the pool! Enjoy your swim sweeties! Now Greeny, if I let you out of there, are you going to behave yourself or are you just gonna float up to the roof?
Chilli: I think you know the answer.
Bluey: No problem! I’ll just get old Boonty out. (grabs wrapping paper tube)
Chilli: No more Boonty in Mum School.
Bluey: Well then what am I meant to do? 
Bandit (offscreen): Gotcha! 
Chilli: Ooh! One moment, I just have to mark this other student. He’s in Dad School! (sits in the shower with Bluey)
Bandit (enters the scene carrying Bingo, who’s giggling ): Aw man! This sack of potatoes sure is heavy! 
Bingo: Put me down!
Bandit: You got it! (puts her down but she runs off) Hey! (catches Bingo before she escapes, who’s squealing) Gee, she’s quick!
Chilli: Oooh, making it fun. Two points!
Bandit: Now clean. 
(Bingo grabs her toothbrush and brushes her teeth, while Bandit pulls out his phone. However, Bingo notices this and runs away again)
Bingo: Yeah!
Bandit: Hey! 
Chilli: Ooh, he’s let himself down there!
(Bingo giggles, but Bandit catches her)
Bandit: Argh! 
Bingo: No! (grabs onto towel)
Bandit: (trying to get Bingo off the towel) Bingo! Let go!
Bingo: Unhand me!
Bandit: Time to bring out the big guns! (tickles Bingo) Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!
Chilli: Ooh, good move!
Bandit: (finally pulls Bingo off the towel) Nrghh! Gotcha!
Bingo: I don’t want to clean my teeth! 
Bandit: Argh, Bingo. There must be a reason why you’re being such a pickle tonight. Hmm. I think you’re still hungry. Come on, you need more food. I’ll race you to the kitchen! Go!
Bingo: ARGHH!
(Bandit and Bingo race offscreen to the kitchen)
Chilli: Whack-a-doo! Top marks!
Bluey: Oooh!
Chilli: Now, do you wanna have another go with Greeny?
(Bluey looks at Greeny, walks out of the shower and removes him from the basket)
Bluey: Hi sweetheart. I think there’s a reason you keep floating off, isn’t there? Hmmm, what could it be? Maybe you just like exploring! Aww, that’s nice Greeny! Well, you’re not old enough to go exploring too far yet. So, this is a special present for you. (grabs a plastic magnet and ties it to Greeny’s string) Because I love you so much. One day you can float up as high as you want. But for now, this will help you stay down here with us. 
(Bluey hugs Greeny. Chilli smiles)
Bluey: (climbs into the tub with Greeny) Now, everyone in the pool! (squeals and giggles while splashing water everywhere)
Chilli: Nice work Mum. 
Bluey: Sit children! Pearl, get off Dronigan! (giggles)
(After the bath, Chilli and Bluey are in the bedroom, drying off the balloons with hairdryers and towels)
Bluey: drying Greeny with a towel) There you go darling, all dry.
Chilli: Excellent drying! You’ve almost passed Mum School.
Bluey: Oooh! Did you hear that kids?
(Chilli stops the hairdryer)
Bluey: Excuse me, can I have a go at the hairdryer? 
Chilli: (lends hairdryer to Bluey) Okay. Just be careful.
Bluey: Woooh! (turns on the dryer and makes it spin in all directions. The balloons disperse off again, however Greeny is floating towards the balcony. Bluey giggles as well) Oh sorry children! 
(Bluey notices Greeny flying out the balcony)
Bluey: Oh! Greeny! (Bluey and Chilli run after him, but he’s too far now) Greeny no! Can you get him back?
Chilli: No honey, he’s off.
Bluey: Will he be okay?
Chilli: Yeah, I think he’ll do just fine.
Bluey: How do you know?
Chilli: Because he’s got a good mum. 
Bluey: Does this mean I failed Mum School?
Chilli: Well, yeah.
Bluey: Aw, I’m such a cushion head.
Chilli: But that’s okay. We all fail Mum School sometimes.
Bluey: Oh! Okay.
Chilli: We can just start again tomorrow. (walks back into the house with Bluey)
Bluey: Thanks Mum.
