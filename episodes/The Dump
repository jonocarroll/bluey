The episode opens with a shot of the boot of the car. Several battered pieces of furniture are visible in the foreground. Bandit opens the boot, and puts a cardboard box inside. Bluey watches him.
Bluey: "Dad, do you know everything?"
Bandit: "Yep."
Bandit puts his fingers to his lips and whistles.
Bandit: "Bingo! Here, girl!"
He slams the boot. Cut to an exterior shot of them, standing in the driveway.
Bluey: "Prove it."
Bandit: "Okay. Bingo's about to run in and ask me where we're going."
Bingo runs up to them, tail wagging.
Bingo: (excited) "Where are we going?"
Bandit: "To the dump!"
Bingo: "Yeah! Dump!"
Bluey: (whispering) "Whoa."
TITLE CARD - The Dump
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called: The DUMP!"
Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo are now driving in the car.
Bingo: "Can we have a hairy monster attack on the way?"
Bandit: "Maybe."
Bluey and Bingo squeal excitedly. The back seat is noticeably messier than it has been thus far - space themed stickers have been stuck on the seats and doors, almonds and a half-eaten sandwich are scattered on the seats, and a colouring book and two uncapped markers are scattered about.
Bluey: "What are we gonna dump at the dump, Dad?"
Bandit's eyes dart to the side, suspiciously.
Bandit: "Uh... just some old stuff."
Bingo: "I'm gonna play car rainbow on the way!"
She looks out the window, and points at a passing car.
Bingo: "Red car!"
Bandit points out the driver's side window.
Bandit: "Brown car!"
Bingo: "Brown's not in the rainbow."
Bandit: "Oh, yeah."
Bluey makes accusing eye contact with Bandit through the rear-view mirror.
Bluey: "I thought you said you knew everything."
Bandit: "I do. Ask me a question."
Bluey: "Okay. Where was I before I was born?"
Bandit: "Yeesh! Ask me another one."
Bluey: "Can I drive the car?"
Bandit: "Oh, that's easy. No."
Bluey: "Why?"
Bandit: "You can't reach the pedals."
Bluey looks at her feet.
Bluey: "Oh, yeah."
Bingo: "Green car!"
Bluey: "What if Bingo does the pedals and I drive the steering wheel?"
Bandit: "Well, if a policeman caught you, you'd have to pay a hundred dollarbucks."
Bluey: "He wouldn't catch us. We'd drive away really fast."
Bandit: "Police cars can drive faster."
Cut to Bandit filling up the car at a petrol station. Bluey continues the conversation through the window.
Bluey: "But we have more petrol. We can drive longer, and his car will stop."
Bandit: "Then he'd get in a helicopter."
Bluye: "Then we'd drive into a tunnel so he couldn't see us."
Cut to the interior of the petrol station. Bandit, Bingo, and Bluey stand around the counter. Bandit gets out his card to pay.
Bandit: "Then he'd land and get on a motorbike. They can go in tunnels.
He taps his card on the terminal, which beeps.
Bluey: "But we get ten red cars that look exactly like ours, and they drive around us so he wouldn't know which one was us."
The gas station attendant looks at Bluey quizzically.
Cut back to the car. They buckle their seat belts.
Bandit: "Who's driving all those other cars?"
Bluey: "Butlers."
Bandit adjusts his rear-view mirror.
Bandit: "Butlers?! Where are you gonna get ten butlers from?"
Bluey shrugs.
Bluey: "The Queen. We'd steal hers."
Bingo giggles.
Bandit: "Well, yeah, that'd probably do it."
Bluey, Bingo: "Hooray!"
Cut to the Heelers, driving down the road again.
Bluey: "So can we drive the car?"
Bandit: "What do you want to drive the car for?"
Bluey: "'Cause we like doing the squirty thing!"
Bingo nods.
Bluey: "Can you push it?"
Bandit: "But the windscreen's not dirty."
Bluey: "Please! Bingo, double please face."
Cut to Bandit's view of the back seat in the rear-view mirror. Bluey and Bingo pull very cute please faces with big shiny eyes.
Bandit: "Oh, all right."
He triggers the windshield wiper fluid.
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
He stops.
Bluey, Bingo: "Again!"
Bandit: "No, it's a waste of water."
Bluey, Bingo: (chanting) "Do it! Do it!"
Bandit spots something in the other lane. He honks the horn.
Bandit: "Hey!"
Bluey: "Why'd you beep your horn?"
Bandit: "Oh, that guy in the orange car isn't a very good driver."
Bingo: "Ooh! Orange car? Where?"
Bluey: "Are you a good driver?"
Bandit: "Yep."
Bluey: "Are you the best driver in the world?"
Bandit: "Yeah, probably."
Bluey: "Ooh, wow."
The car stops at a red light, beside a bus.
Bingo: "Red light!"
Bingo: "So, did you know, Bluey — yellow car — um, that little chubby gnomes climb up the traffic lights and paint them red and green?"
Bluey: "Ohh."
Bluey: (to Bandit) "Ooh, what's that picture on the side of the bus?"
Bandit: "It's an ad for a movie about superheroes."
Bluey: "Oooh! Is that one a goodie or a baddie?"
Bandit: "A goodie."
Bluey: "Are you a goodie?"
Bandit: "Definitely."
Bluey: "What about me?"
Bandit: "Well, it depends if you do good or bad things."
Bluey: "Um, I set the table and I do the dishes. Are they good things?"
Bandit: "Those are very good things."
Bingo: "The gnome is painting the light green."
Bluey: "But, sometimes I ignore Bingo."
Bandit: "Well, you shouldn't ignore Bingo."
Bingo: "Dad!"
Bandit: "Do you say 'Sorry?'"
Bluey: "Yeah."
Bingo: "Daaad! It's green!"
Bandit: "Then you're a goodie."
Bluey: "Hooray!"
A car horn honks. Bluey and Bingo look out the rear window at the car behind them.
Bluey: "Why was that car beeping you?"
Bingo: "Because the light was green!"
Bandit: (embarrased) "Uh, yeah, I didn't see it change."
Bluey: "Are you not a very good driver, Dad? Dad? Daad!"
She waves to get Bandit's attention. Bandit looks increasingly uncomfortable as he avoids answering
Bluey: "Are you not the best driver in the world? I'm asking you a question. Dad! Daaad! DAAAD!"
Bandit triggers the windshield wiper fluid.
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah! Squirty thing!"
Bluey and Bingo squeal and laugh.
Bluey: "You're the best dad in the world."
Bandit: "I am."
Cut to the entrance to the dump. A purple ute is coming down the driveway. The Heelers car drives up and drives over a speed bump.
Bingo: "Purple car! Hooray!"
Bandit: "See that sign, kids? It says 'The Dump!'"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yay! The dump!"
Cut to the interior of the dump. Bandit throws an old office chair as hard as he can, over a railing onto a huge pile of garbage.
Bandit: "And... dump!"
He dusts his hands and pulls the cardboard box out of the boot. The kids watch excitedly.
Bandit: "I love the dump."
The lid of the box flips open, and a piece of paper escapes. It's a crayon drawing of Bluey.
Bluey: "Hey! Stop! That's my drawing!"
Bandit: "Oh, is it?"
He bends down to pick it up. More drawings fall out of the cardboard box.
Bluey: "Aah! Those are all my drawings! You're dumping my drawings!"
Bandit picks up the rest of the drawings. Bluey sags, saddened.
Bandit: "Uh...well, you do a lot of drawings, kid."
Bingo: "She worked really hard on those drawings."
Bandit: "I know, but—"
Bluey: (voice breaking) "That's a picture of me."
Bingo: "You're throwing away Bluey!"
Bluey whimpers. She tears up, and turns away from Bandit. Bingo glares at Bandit.
Bingo: "You're a baddie."
She turns to comfort Bluey. Bandit looks at the drawings, then sighs and puts them back in the box.
Cut to the car interior. Bluey sits in between the car seats, holding her knees. Bingo strokes her back. Bandit puts the carboard box back in the boot and slams the door. He talks to them through the window.
Bandit: "Hey, Bluey, I've put your drawings back in the boot."
He hands Bluey the first drawing.
Bandit: "I'm sorry. We can keep 'em."
Bluey: (hoarsely) "I don't think you are the best dad in the world."
Bandit: "Yeah, you're right, Bluey. I'm not. Or the best driver. And I don't know
everything, either. I was just being silly."
Bluey puts down the drawing.
Bluey: "So you don't know where I was before I was born?"
Bandit: "Nah."
Bluey: "Oh."
Bandit: "You'll have to figure that out for yourself."
Bluey: "How do I do that?"
Bandit: "I'm sure you'll work it out. You figured out how to avoid capture by the police."
Bluey giggles and kicks her feet.
Bluey: "Yeah, I did. But why were you dumping my drawings in the stinky dump forever?"
Bandit: "Well, I wasn't putting them in the stinky dump."
Bandit turns and points behind him, at a blue bin full of paper.
Bandit: "I was putting them in this dump. Any drawings you throw in this dump get mushed up and turned into new paper."
Bluey: "Ohh. Like brand-new bits of paper?"
Bandit: "Yeah, so some other kid can draw a picture on it."
Bingo: "And what happens when that kid's dad throws it away?"
Bandit: "Well, then it gets mushed up again and turned into another piece of paper for another kid. And over and over."
Bluey, Bingo: "Oh, wow!"
Bandit: "See? I know some stuff."
Bluey gives the drawing back to Bandit.
Bluey: "You can throw it away, Dad."
Bandit: "Oh. You sure?"
Bluey: "Yeah. I can do another one."
Bandit crumples it up, and shoots a three-pointer into the bin.
Bandit: "Hwee!"
He makes the shot. He pumps his arm.
Bandit: "Uss!"
Bingo: "Hooray!"
Bluey: "Good dumping, Dad!"
Cut to the Heelers' car, on the drive home. Bingo looks out the window.
Bingo: "I just need a pink car. Please, everyone. It's the last one I need."
Bandit: "Okay, Bingo, I'll keep an eye out."
Bluey: "Me too."
Bandit: "Uh-oh! Uh-oh!"
Bluey, Bingo: "What is it?"
Bandit: "HAIRY MONSTER ATTAAAAACK!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Cut to the Heelers, going through an automatic car wash. Bingo is in the front passenger seat, Bluey is in the back seat in between the booster seats. They both lean forward and brace for impact.
Bandit, Bluey: "Here it comes!"
The rollers swing in from the sides and top.
Bluey, Bandit, Bingo: "Aaaah!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Get us out of here, Dad!"
Bandit: "Okay! Vroom!"
Bandit makes engine noises with his mouth and pretends to drive.
Bluey, Bingo: "Hooray!"
Bandit: "Vroom!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Nice driving, Dad!"
Cut to later. They're driving again, as the sun begins to set. Bluey thoughtfully looks at the orange-tinted skyline.
Bluey: "Dad, you know my drawing?"
Bandit: "Yeah?"
Bluey: "Was that someone else's drawing before it was mine?"
Bandit: "Well, what do you think?"
Bluey thinks for a moment.
Bluey: "Yeah, I think so."
Bandit points out the passenger-side window.
Bandit: "Bingo! Pink car!"
Bingo: "Car rainbow!"
Bluey: "Hooray!"
Bingo: "YOU'RE THE BEST DAD IN THE WOOOORLD!"
Bandit: "Really?"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeahh!"
Bandit: "Whoo! I'm back, baby!"
Bandit repeatedly honks the horn in celebration. He triggers the windshield wiper fluid, and Bluey and Bingo squeal and laugh.
The "Hairy Monster Attack" music, a cheerful rock number, plays over the credits. The sounds of Bandit squirting the windshield wiper fluid and Bluey and Bingo laughing and squealing continue throughout the credits. Bluey dances as the credits roll.
