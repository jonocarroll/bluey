The episode opens with Bandit driving the car. Bluey and Bingo are in their car seats in the back. Bluey leans into the center of the car.
Bluey: Dad, who's your favorite — me or Bingo?
Bandit: Favorite?
Bluey: Keeping in mind, I can run the fastest.
Bingo: Yeah but I can whistle.
Bingo whistles, barely.
Bingo: See?
The scene cuts to a grocery store parking lot. Bandit parks the car and opens the rear door. Bluey gets out immediately.
Bluey: So who?
Bandit: You're both my favorites.
Bluey: But I can kick my own bum , watch. Hunh!
Bluey jumps up and kicks her bum.
Bandit: Look kid, parents don't pick favorites.
Bluey: Why not?
Bingo jumps down from the car.
Bandit: They just don't.
Bingo: One, two...
Bingo kicks her bum and giggles.
The scene cuts to Bandit and the kids entering the grocery store.
Bandit: Alright, Let's hit this hard and quick. Sound good, kids?
Bluey: Ooh! Hey, Bingo, let's play Kids.
Bingo: Yeah!
Bandit: Awww, not Kids!
TITLE CARD - Kids
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called "Kids"!
The scene cuts to the entrance gate of the grocery store. Bandit holds it open for the kids while reading his list.
Bluey: Okay Bingo, you're a toddler and your name is Snowdrop — and I'll be your mum.
Bingo: (baby talk) Okay, Mama.
Bluey: (to Bandit) And you're Snowdrop's older brother. And your name is (giggles) Diddums.
Bandit: Diddums?!
The children giggle and Bluey takes the shopping list from Bandit.
Bluey: I'll take that Diddums.
Bandit shakes his head and looks tired.
The scene changes to the trolley section of the store.
Bluey: Are you ready to go shopping Snowdrop?
Bingo: (baby talk) Yeah, Mama.
Bandit tries to take a trolley but Bluey stops him.
Bluey: Unh, unh, unh! Mum's i ncharge of the trolley, Diddums, children use those ones.
Bluey points to a child-size trolley.
Bandit: Oh, Mum!
The kids giggle again.
The scene changes to the produce section. Bluey runs with the trolley while Bingo squeals with glee. She crashes into the lettuce, knocking one to the ground.
Bluey: No dilly-dallying, Diddums.
She runs off, out of frame. Bandit enters the shot.
Bandit: Yes Mum.
Bandit hurriedly grabs vegetables and puts them in his tiny trolley.
The scene changes to the dairy aisle. Bluey is holding up a gallon of chocolate milk.
Bluey: Chocolate or pink, Snowdrop?
Bingo: (baby talk) Both!
Bluey: Okay, my sweetie.
Bluey drops the chocolate milk in the trolley, and turns to get some strawberry milk.
Bingo: (baby talk) Snowdrop love chocolate milk.
Bandit stealthily takes the chocolate milk out of the trolley to put it back.
Bingo: (baby talk) Mama, Mama! Diddums being sneaky!
Bandit waves his hands and mouths "no".
Bingo: Mama Mama Diddums' being sneaky!
Bluey: Diddums! How very dare you! And who said you can have all that green stuff?
Bingo giggles.
Bandit: Please, Mum, can't we get some vegetables?
Bluey: Of course not! Do you think I'm made of money?
Bluey drops the strawberry milk in the trolley.
Bandit: Well, how come Snowdrop gets chocolate milk?
Bingo uses her cute face.
Bluey: Because she's so cuuuute!
Bandit: What?!
Bluey: Now put them back!
Bingo giggles.
The scene cuts back to the produce section.
Bandit: (Groaning) Ohhh.
In the background, Bluey and Bingo crash the car into the end of the produce aisle.
Bandit growls as he starts to put produce back. His friend Rocko approaches.
Rocko: G'day Bandit, how's it going?
Bandit: Hey, Rocko. Don't ask.
Bluey walks in, furious.
Bluey: What's going on, Diddums! Lollygagging with your friends again?
Bandit: Muuuum, your embarrassing me.
Bluey: Back to the trolley this instant young man!
Bandit: Yes, Mum. See ya, Rocko.
Bluey giggles.
Bluey: Oh hello Rocko. How's your mother?
Rocko: She's good, Mrs. Heeler.
The scene changes to an endcap display of chips. Bingo and Bandit are waiting for Bluey. Bingo picks up a packet of chips, and then conspicuously drops it.
Bluey: Honestly, Diddums, I can't believe— Oh! Who threw this on the ground?
Bingo points at Bandit.
Bluey: Diddums!
Bandit: WHAT?! It wasn't me, it was Snowdrop!
Bingo makes a very cute face.
Bluey: Snowdrop would never do such a thing.
Bandit: This isn't fair! You always take her side.
Bluey: That's because Snowdrop is an angel and you're a very naughty boy!
Bandit: (gasps) Huh! Well, I'm a naughty boy, am I?
Bluey: Yes, you're a very naughty boy.
Bingo: (baby talk) Naughty boy!
Bluey giggles
Bandit: Okay then.
Bandit steals the shopping list, and runs off with the trolley.
Bluey: Hey!
Bingo: Naughty boy! (x2)
Bluey: Diddums, come back this instant!
The scene changes to the health food aisle. Bandit sweeps packages off the shelf as he runs past.
Bandit: Flaxseed, pepitas, almond flour — yes, please!
Bingo: Naughty boy! (x9)
Bluey: Stop it Diddums! You will do what your mother says.
Bandit: No! I'm a naughty boy!
Bluey: Didduuuums!
The scene changes to another aisle. Bluey runs hard, and overtakes Bandit.
Bandit: Walnuts, psyllium husks, sugar-free chocolate — don't mind if I do!
Bluey gets in front of the cart, and holds out her hands. Bandit stops.
Bluey: Stop! Put. That. Back.
Bandit: NO!
Bingo giggles while Bluey removes her from the trolley seat.
Bluey: Ooh-hoo-hoo! You wait 'til your father hears about this!
Bandit blows a raspberry and holds the sugar-free chocolate over the trolley.
Bluey: Ugh! I'm going to count to three, Diddums.
Bluey: One... Two... Two and a half...
Bandit drops the chocolate into the trolley.
Bluey: (gasps) That's it!
Bluey stomps angrily towards Bandit.
Bluey: (grunting) Heh, heh, heh!
Bluey: (whispering) You have to bend down.
Bandit: (whispering) Oh, okay.
Bandit bends down, and Bluey grabs his ear.
Bluey: You're going to time out young man!
Bandit: Ow ow ow ow ow!
Bingo giggles.
The scene cuts to the toilet paper display. Bluey pulls Bandit along by his ear.
Bandit: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
She lets him go, and he rubs at his ear.
Bluey: Now you sit in that toilet paper chair and have a good think about what you've done.
Bandit: Toilet paper chair?! This isn't fair, Mum! Why doesn't Snowdrop have to go to timeout? She's the one who's being cheeky!
Bluey: Because she's my favorite!
Bandit gasps.
Bandit: You mean Snowdrop's really your favorite?
Bluey: Yes. Snowdrop is my favorite.
Bandit: Oh, I see. I'll just sit here until you tell me I can come out.
Bandit sits on a package of toilet paper.
Bluey: Well, um...Yes, good.
The scene briefly cuts to a plastic donation dog. It cuts again to the greeting card display. Bingo is playing with a musical card. Bandit can be seen in time-out in the background.
Bingo giggles.
Bluey looks at Bandit.
The scene cuts to Bandit. A docket boy is going down the aisle with a pricing gun. He sticks a price label on Bandit's forehead.
Docket Boy: ...Can I help you?
Bandit: I wish you could, mate.
The docket boy walks away. Bluey looks guiltily at Bandit. Bingo is giggling at the musical card.
Bluey: No cards, today, sweetie. Put them back, Come on.
Bingo: (baby talk) No! Snowdrop want card!
Bluey: Maybe that's enough time in the toilet paper chair for your brother, I think. Come on, Snowdrop.
Bingo throws an armful of cards up in the air.
Bingo: (baby talk) Stinky Mummy! Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.
Bluey: Snowdrop!
Bingo blows a raspberry.
Bluey: You are a cheeky toddler!
Bingo giggles.
The scene cuts back to Bandit. He's talking to a customer.
Bandit: Personally, I can't go back to single ply.
Customer: No, that's madness.
Bandit hands the customer a package of toilet paper.
Customer: See ya, mate.
Bluey: You can come out now, Diddums.
Bandit: Oh, good, 'cause this is actually embarrassing.
Bluey helps pull Bandit out.
Bluey: You were right. It was Snowdrop being cheeky all along. I'm sorry I didn't believe you, and that I said she was my favourite.
Bluey hugs Bandit.
Bandit: I love you, Mum.
While they hug, a customer reaches behind them to get a package of toilet paper, then walks away, staring at them.
Bluey: Diddums, can I put you in charge of the trolley?
Bandit: Yes, Mum.
Bluey: 'Cause I've got a cheeky toddler to sort out!
Back at the card display, Bandit is reading his list. Bluey makes Bingo pick up the cards. Bingo throws them in the air and runs away. Bluey drags her back.
A brief time lapse shows the trolley filling up with normal groceries.
At the candy aisle, Bingo picks up a huge lollipop. She gives Bluey her best "please" face yet. Bluey shakes her head. Bingo stomps her foot and puts it back.
In the toy aisle, Bluey is following Bandit. She stops and looks back — Bingo is throwing a tantrum on the floor. Bluey walks away. Bingo stops and sits up when she sees she has no audience.
The scene changes to the checkout. The checkout lady is dooting their groceries.
Bluey: You've been such a great help today, Diddums.
Bandit: Muuum, you're embarrassing me.
Checkout Lady: What a fine young boy you have there, Mrs. Heeler.
Bluey: Thank you, checkout lady. He is definitely my favourite.
Bandit gasps.
Bluey: Ooh! I mean... both my children are my favourites.
Bandit ruffles Bluey's hair. She giggles.
Checkout Lady: Um, Mrs. Heeler?
The checkout lady points to the conveyor. Bluey is sitting on a box of cereal, treating a stick of celery as an oar.
Bingo: ♫ Row, row, row your boat / gently down the stream ♫
Bluey: Snowdrop!
Bingo giggles.
The episode music, a peppy flute melody, plays over the credits. Bluey is dancing.
