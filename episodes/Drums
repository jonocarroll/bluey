The episode opens in a musical instrument shop. Chilli is talking to a clerk. Bluey and Bingo stand behind her.
Bandit: "I'm trying to get my youngest daughter into violin. I think it might really suit her."
Clerk: "Well, you've come to the right place."
Chilli: "Can you talk me through what's here?"
Clerk: "Yes, uh, well, we've got lots."
Bingo looks away, having noticed something offscreen.
Clerk: "Big ones, little ones, wooden ones..."
Bingo walks over to an electronic drum set.
Clerk: (off screen) "...uh, different wooden ones, cheap ones, expensive ones."
Bingo looks the drum set over.
Clerk: (off screen) "Normally for someone your child's age, we'd start them off with a quarter-sized violin."
Bingo picks up a drumpstick and taps experimentally on the snare drum. It makes a quiet thud.
Chilli: "Okay, how much is that one?"
Clerk: "Well, that depends."
She taps twice on the hi hats, making a quiet tap.
Clerk: "Firstly on where the violin's from."
Bingo loses interest and turns away."
Clerk: "If we imported it from Europe—"
She turns back, noticing a pair of headphones.
Bingo: "Huh?"
Clerk: "—that can be quite expensive, but..."
Bingo puts on the headphones, muffling the Clerk's voice. She sits down at the drum kit. She picks up a drumstick, and hits the snare drum, and this time, it makes a proper drum sound. Bingo gasps.
She hits the snare drum a few more times, then giggles. She hits the high tom twice and giggles again. She hits the mid tom twice, and the low tom twice, then giggles again.
She picks up the other stick, and starts tapping on the ride cymbal with both sticks repeatedly.
She climbs up on the stool, and then hits the ride and crash cymbals at the same time. She giggles. She hits them alternately for a while.
Then, she spots the kick pedal.
Bingo: "Oooh."
She steps on it, hitting the bass drum. She giggles, then steps on it repeatedly.
She starts playing a basic rhythm, alternating between the bass and snare drums. She giggles again.
She starts playing the rhythm again, then starts to add an extra bass beat with syncopation. She starts adding cymbals, and then throws in extra beats on the other drums.
Cut back to Chilli, talking to the clerk. Bingo continues playing silently in the background.
Chilli: "Does that make a difference?"
Clerk: "It really depends, on who's playing it, where they're playing it—"
Cut back to Bingo, who is concentrating fiercly, playing a more complicated beat. Then she notices something and stops.
Bingo: "Ooh."
She reaches over to the control panel, and turns a dial. She hits the high tom, producing a synthesizer-style sound. She laughs, then hits it a few more times.
She reaches over to the control panel again and presses a button, starting a metronome and a rock-and-roll electric guitar track. Bingo smiles widely, and joins in after a few measures.
Cut back to Chilli and the clerk.
Chilli: "Do you do lessons?"
Clerk: "Me? No."
The clerk rubs his left forearm.
Clerk: "RSI of the forepaw."
Cut back to Bingo. Her tongue is stuck out in concentration as she plays along to the guitar track. The song ends, with Bingo playing a flourish on the toms and then hitting the cymbals. She throws her hands in the air.
Bingo: "Yeah!"
She wags her tail and laughs.
Chilli: "Time to go, Bingo."
Chilli and Bluey turn and walk away. Bingo sets the drumsticks and headphones down, then bows to the drum set. She runs off after Chilli and Bluey.
