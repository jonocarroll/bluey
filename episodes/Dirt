The episode opens on an exterior shot of the Heeler's house. Toys are strewn everywhere: notably, Chattermax is in between the raised garden beds, the birdie kite is stuck in a tree, and the pedal car is crashed in a bush. The camera pans to the Chow Chows' house, which is pristine.
In their bathroom, a montage shows Wendy bathing Judo. She lathers up Judo's hair.
Wendy: "Shampoo..."
Another shot of Wendy shampooing Judo.
Wendy: "Shampoo again..."
Wendy squeezes out pink conditioner in Judo's hair.
Wendy: "Condition..."
She leans Judo's head forward and pours a cup of water over her hair.
Wendy: "Rinse..."
She leans Judo's head back and pours a cup of water over her hair.
Wendy: "...and rinse again."
In front of the sink, she brushes Judo's arm fur with a plastic dog brush.
Wendy: "Wide brush."
She brushes Judo's tail with a hairbrush.
Wendy: "Fine brush."
She dries Judo's hair with a blow dryer.
Wendy: "And dry."
Judo: "Are you almost finished, Mum?"
Wendy: "Almost."
Judo: "It takes a long time to do my hair, doesn't it?"
Wendy: "It does, but it's important, sweetheart. We're Chow Chows."
Judo: " We're known for our long, lovely coats."
Wendy sighs and puts down the hair dryer.
Wendy: "Sometimes I wish we weren't, though."
She puts Judo's headband on her head.
Wendy: "...And finished."
Judo: "Is it as beautiful as yours?"
Wendy: "Even more beautiful."
Judo: "Now off you go, sweetie. Go and play.
Judo runs out of the bathroom while Wendy begins tidying up.
The sound of a truck backing up can be heard. Judo stops and looks out a window.
Driver: (offscreen) "Yeah, mate?"
Bandit (offscreen) "Yeah, yeah, just there."
Outside the window is a dump truck full of dirt. Bandit is directing the driver with his hands, while Bluey and Bingo look on.
Driver: (offscreen) "Yeah, 'ow's that lookin'?"
Bandit (offscreen) "Yeah, that's good, mate."
Bandit gives the driver a thumbs-up. The driver lifts the bed of the dump truck, leaving a huge pile of dirt in the Heelers' front lawn.
Bluey & Bingo: "Diiirt!"
Bluey and Bingo run forwards and fling themselves face-first into the pile of dirt. They laugh.
At her window, Judo watches the spectacle.
Judo: "Mum, can I go play with Bluey?"
Wendy: "Sure thing, sweetie."
Judo smiles and wags. She starts to run off.
Wendy: "Just don't get dirty."
TITLE CARD: Dirt
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Dirt."
Bluey and Bingo are waist-deep in the pile of dirt, rubbing it on themselves.
Bluey: (posh accent) ♫ "I'm having a dirt shower. Time to condition." ♫
She rubs a double handful of dirt on her head. Bingo rubs dirt under her arms.
Bingo: ♫ "Oh, I'm in the shower with diiirt! Dirt please!" ♫
Bluey laughs. Judo runs up.
Bluey: "Judo, look! Dirt!"
Judo: "Can I play?"
Bluey: "Yeah, watch this."
Bluey climbs to the top of the pile and flops down on her bum.
Bluey: "Diiirt!"
A few clods of dirt roll down the hill and land by Judo's feet. She recoils.
Judo: "Ah!"
Bluey: "What's wrong?"
Judo: "Um, I'm not supposed to get dirty."
Bluey: "Oh. Well, it might be hard to play in the dirt then."
Bingo picks up a speck of dirt and examines it closely.
Bingo: "Yes, this dirt is very dirty."
Bluey: "Why can't you get dirty?"
Judo: "I think it's because I'm a Chow Chow, and we are known for our long, lovely hair."
Bluey slides down the pile to dirt to stand next to Judo. Bingo follows her.
Bluey: "That's true, you do have lovely hair."
Bingo: "Yeees..."
Bingo, as though mesmerized, slowly walks forwards, extremely dirty arms outstretched.
Bingo: "I want to touch it."
Judo backs away, flailing her arms.
Judo: "Ah!"
Bluey grabs Bingo and pulls her back. Bingo laughs sheepishly.
Bingo: "Sorry."
Bluey: "I don't think we have lovely hair."
Bingo: "No, Heelers don't have lovely hair."
Judo: "Is there a way to play in the dirt without getting dirty?"
Bluey & Bingo: "Oh, um..."
Bluey: "Um..."
Bingo: "Well I'm not sure..."
Judo: "Oh..."
Bluey: "Oh, I know!"
The scene briefly cuts away to an airplane flying across the sky.
Bluey and Bingo grunt as the haul Judo to the top of the dirt mound, using a disposable roasting pan as a sled.
Judo: "Um, careful. Wait, wait!"
They get her to the summit. Bluey holds onto the sled.
Bluey: "Okay, you ready?"
Judo: "Yeah!"
Bluey grunts, as she and Bingo give Judo a shove. Judo slides down the mound.
Judo: "Whee!"
Judo sits happily in the sled for a moment, then stands up and starts examining herself.
Judo: "Did I get dirty?!"
Bluey and Bingo slide down the hill and examine her.
Bingo: "Uh... no!"
Pups: "Hooray!"
Judo: "Can we do it again?"
Bluey slumps.
Bluey: "Oh, Judo, it's a bit hard to pull you up."
Judo: "Oh. Okay."
They both look down, disappointed.
Bingo: "Ooh! Let's show Judo di-di di-dirt!"
Bluey: "Oh, yeah!"
Judo stands aside, as Bluey and Bingo back up and prepare to charge. In an impression of the bugle call for a charge, she yells:
Bingo: "Di-di di-dirt!"
Bingo runs forward and embeds herself in the pile of dirt. She laughs and steps down, leaving a Bingo-shaped impression in the pile.
Bluey: "Di-di di-dirt!"
Bluey runs forward and embeds herself in the side of the pile of dirt. She laughs and steps aside.
Bluey: "You want a go?"
Judo: "Uh, I'm not sure I can do that without getting dirty."
Bingo looks down at herself, uniformly coated in dirt.
Bingo: "Uh, yeah, me neither."
Bluey: "Are you sure you can't get dirty?"
Judo: "Well, let me go ask my mum something."
Judo runs off.
In her kitchen, Wendy is digging at one of the overhead lights in her stove hood with a spoon.
Wendy: "Oh, come on."
She blows her hair out of her eyes.
Wendy: "Get in there."
Judo: "Mum?"
Wendy: "Yes, honey."
She blows her hair out of her eyes again.
Judo: "Why is that I can't get dirty again?"
Wendy: "Because we have such long hair. It just takes so long to clean it. It's just easier not to get it dirty in the first place."
Judo: "Yeah. Uh...that makes sense."
Judo walks away, disappointed. Wendy blows hair out of her eyes again.
She returns to the Heelers' front yard. Bluey and Bingo have their arms full of an assortment of protective gear.
Bluey: "Judo, we found a way you can play di-di di-dirt."
Judo: "Really?"
The scene cuts to show Judo kitted out in the protective gear. She's wearing a welding helmet, an apron, rubber dish gloves, shin guards, and gum boots.
Bluey & Bingo: (chanting) Ju-do, Ju-do, Ju-do, Ju-do!
Judo starts to hobble slowly towards the dirt pile. The shin guards are so over-large that she can't bend her knees.
Bluey & Bingo: (chanting) Ju-do, Ju-do, Ju-do!
Judo: "Di-di di-dirt!"
She slaps into the dirt pile.
Bluey: "Uh, you're meant to go a little faster."
Judo extricates herself and lifts the welding helmet.
Judo: "It's a bit hard to run in all this stuff."
Bingo: "Well, at least you didn't get dirty."
Judo: "Yeah, the suit really works!"
Bandit starts spraying the dirt pile with a hose.
Bandit: "Who wants mud?"
Bluey & Bingo: "Yeah, mud!"
They both jump into the wet part of the dirt pile, laughing.
Bingo: "Come in the mud, Judo!"
Judo: "Uh, I'm not sure this will keep mud out."
Bluey: "Oh, yeah, probably not."
Judo: "I might just go home."
Judo takes off her protective suit.
Wendy looks over her fence. Judo slowly starts walking back towards her house.
Wendy: "Oh, my goodness!"
Bandit: "Morning, Wendy. Got some dirt."
Wendy: "Yes, I can see."
Bluey: "Wendy, can Judo play in the dirt with us?"
Wendy: "Oh, well, I'm not sure."
Bluey and Bingo both clasp their hands together."
Bluey & Bingo: "Please?"
Bandit: "Kids, don't pester."
Wendy: "No, it's—it's fine. Yes, Judo can play."
Judo's tail starts to wag.
Judo: "What? Really? But you said I can't get dirty."
Wendy: "Yes, I did. But... I want you to have fun, sweetie."
Bluey: "So, Judo can play in the mud?"
Wendy: "Well... it's up to Judo."
Bluey: "Judo?"
Judo considers for a moment, then slumps and walks back home.
Wendy: "I'll be right back."
Wendy follows her. Bandit sprays Bingo and Bluey with the hose.
Bingo & Bluey: "Aah!"
Judo is sitting sadly on her front steps. Wendy sits down next to her.
Wendy: "Why don't you want to play in the dirt with the girls?"
Judo: "I just don't want to."
Wendy: "Oh, go on! It's important to play and have fun."
Judo: "But what about my long, lovely coat? It takes so long to clean."
Wendy: "Oh, yes. I said that, didn't I?"
Bluey and Bingo laugh. Wendy watches as Bandit sprays them with the hose."
Wendy: "Oh, fiddlesticks! I'll be right back, sweetheart."
Wendy walks into the house. Bluey and Bingo continue to laugh and splash mud everywhere.
Wendy returns with a towel, scissors, and a hand mirror. She vocalizes as she lays out the towel on the lawn.
Wendy: ♫ "Ooooh, mmmmm, la di dee, da dum dum." ♫
She gets out the hand mirror, and cuts off her bangs.
Wendy: ♫ "Hmmmm--hmm-hmm." ♫
Judo: "Aah! Mum, what are you doing?"
Wendy: "I'm going short."
Bandit alternates between spraying the kids and the dirt pile with the hose.
Bandit: "Dirty, clean. Dirty, clean."
The kids laugh. Bandit notices Wendy.
Bandit: "Hey, check it out. Wendy's gone nuts!"
Bluey & Bingo: "Whoa!"
In a montage, Wendy clips her fur short, all over her body. Judo watches, visibly excited."
Wendy: "And finished."
Wendy examines her new look in a the hand mirror."
Judo: "And finished. What do you think?"
Judo: "I love it!"
Judo jumps off the porch and hugs her mum, hard.
Wendy: "Ooh!"
Wendy rubs at the fur on her face.
Wendy: "Oh, it feels so light!"
Judo: "Can you do me?"
Wendy: "Are you sure?"
Judo: "Yes I'm sure."
Wendy: "Okay, let's do it."
Bluey and Bingo are still waist-deep in the mud pile, making mud pies. Bandit comes up with a wheelbarrow.
Bandit: "Okay. kids, time to scoot. I've gotta top-dress the lawn now."
Bluey & Bingo: "Okay, Dad."
Judo: (offscreen) "Di-di di-dirt!"
Judo, with much shorter fur, runs towards them.
Bluey & Bingo: "Aah! Bald Judo!"
Judo slams face-first into the pile of dirt.
Bluey & Bingo: "Yeah!"
Judo: "Whoo!"
Judo turns over and makes a mud angel. Bluey and Bingo slide down the hill. All three laugh.
Bandit: "Eh, I'll do it later."
Bandit walks away.
A montage shows the three girls playing in the mud. All three make mud angels. Then, Bluey shampoos Judo's hair with mud. Having shaped a spiral path into the dirt mound, all three run down it. Judo and Bluey cheer, as Bingo runs up and jumps feet-first into the mud."
Judo: "Here I come!"
Judo runs up one side of the dirt mound and slides down the other."
Judo: "Whoo!"
Bluey and Bingo slide down after her.
Bluey: "Whoo-hoo!"
Bingo: "Whoo!"
Judo rolls on her side through a patch of mud. Bluey and Bingo roll after her."
Judo: "Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!"
Judo slides down the dirt mound again.
Judo: "Whoo!"
Bandit watches from the front steps. Wendy walks through the Heeler's yard.
Wendy: "Morning again, Bandit."
Bandit: "Morning again, Wendy."
She takes a seat on the front step, next to him.
Bandit: "Ooh, I like the new look."
Wendy: "Thanks."
Bandit: "What brought that on?"
Wendy: "Oh, you know..."
Judo: "Mum, watch this!"
Judo slides down the mud pile again.
Judo: "Whoo-hoo!"
Wendy: "It was time for a change."
The theme for Wendy's haircut plays over the end credits. Bluey's dancing has been replaced with Wendy's barber scissors and hand mirror.
