The play opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler's house. It's pre-dawn twilight. A trio of bin chickens walk around the stage, scavenging. The sound of a garbage truck scares them off. A flock of rainbow lorikeets swoops back and forth across the stage.
The scene transitions to the playroom, during the day. Bluey enters from stage left.
Bluey: Bingooo! Do you want to play musical statues with me?
Bingo: (offstage) Yes!
Bluey: Hooray!
Bingo enters from stage right.
Bluey: Mooom!
Chilli: (offstage) Yes?
Bluey and Bingo: Do you want to play musical statues with us?
Chilli: (offstage) Yeah!
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Chilli enters from stage right.
Bluey: Now we just need Dad.
Bluey and Bingo: Daaad! Do you want to play musical statues with us?
There is no response. Chilli puts her hands on her hips.
Bluey: Hm. Let's try again.
Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli : Dad! Do you want to play musical statues with us?
Bandit enters from stage left, out of their view, carrying a basket of laundry.
Chilli: Just one more time.
Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli : Dad— 
Bandit: What?
Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli : Wha?!
They jump and turn around. Then they laugh.
Chilli: Don't do that.
Bandit: Do what?
Bluey: Do you want to play musical statues with us?
Bandit: Okay.
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!
Bandit sets down the laundry basket and pulls out his phone.
Bandit: Hold on. Let me find some music. Okay... music...
His phone dings.
Bandit: Oh, hang on. Lucky's dad sent me an article about the lawn grubs. You think the lawn's looking a bit brown?
Bluey and Bingo: Daaad.
Bandit: Look, I don't know what lawn grubs are, but they don't sound good.
Chilli: I thought you were gonna be off your phone this weekend.
Bandit: Huh? Oh, yeah, I was just choosing some music. That's right.
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: Okay. Ready?
Bluey and Bingo: Ready!
Bandit: Let's go!
An arrangement of the Bluey theme begins to play. The Heelers line up along the edge of the stage, facing the audience, and dance.
Bluey: (singing along) Doo, doo, doo doo dooo.
Bandit: Let's do this to this. Woo hoo, yeah! C'mon everyone. Let's dance!
Bingo: Yeah!
Chilli: Yeah! Join in, everyone! Woo!
Bandit: Shake those tails!
Chilli: Woo!
Bluey: ♫ Da-nanana, na na na! ♫
The music stops. Bluey keeps dancing.
Bluey: ♫ Da-nanana, na na na! ♫ 
Bandit, Bingo, and Chilli: Bluey!
Bluey: ♫ Da-nanana, na na na! ♫
Chilli: Bluey, stop dancing!
Bandit laughs.
Chilli: Yer out, Bluey!
Bluey: Aww.
Bluey stops dancing and stands back.
Chilli: Okay, here we go again!
The music and dancing resume.
The music stops. Bandit keeps dancing.
Bandit: ♫ Hmm-hmhmhm-hm hm hm-hm, hm-hm. Hm hm hm hm hm HM hm! ♫
Chilli laughs.
Bingo: Dad.
Bandit: Aw, biscuits.
Bandit stands back. The music and dancing resume.
Chilli: It's just you and me now, Bingo.
Bingo: ♫ Da-da-da-da da da-da da-da. ♫
The music stops. Bingo keeps dancing.
Bingo: ♫ Da-da-da-da da da DA. Da-da-da-da— ♫
Chilli: Bingo.
Bingo: ♫ —da da DA! ♫
Chilli: Bingooo.
Bingo: ♫ Da-da-da-da da— ♫
Chilli: BINGO!
Bingo: Aw, biscuits.
Bandit snickers.
Chilli: I won! Woo!
Chilli raises her arms in celebration.
Bluey: Mom won!
Bandit: Mom wins!
Chilli: Oh, wow! I never win. Again!
Bandit: All right, let's go again.
Bluey: Bingo, watch this!
The music starts again, and Chilli and Bandit begin dancing. Bluey jumps as high as she can. Bingo watches.
Bluey: Whoooa! Yeah!
Bingo starts jumping along with her.
Bingo: Whee! (giggles)
Bluey goes back to regular dancing. Bingo watches, then after a few seconds starts doing the same dance.
Bluey: Bingo, you're copying my dancing.
Bingo: Oh, sorry.
Bluey: Moom! Bingo's just copying me!
Chilli: (amused) It's okay. She can copy you if she wants.
All four Heelers start dancing in unison. The music stops (except for a violin). Mom does a ballet jump.
Chilli: ♫ Deedly-dee-deeee! ♫
Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo: Mum!
The music resumes. Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo resume dancing in unison.
Bingo: Mum's out.
The music briefly turns into Ode to Joy. The music stops (except for a violin). Bluey keeps dancing.
Bandit, Bingo, and Chilli: Bluey!
Bandit: Yeah!
The music resumes, with electric guitar. Bandit and Bingo play air guitar. Bingo imitates Chuck Berry's duck walk. The music stops, Bandit keeps going.
Bandit: ♫ Weedly-weedly-weedly-beedly-beedly-beedly bwee-deer-ner-ner dee dee deeeeew... ♫
Bandit clears his throat.
Bandit: (quietly) Sorry, got a bit carried away.
Bluey and Bingo: Dad!
Bingo: Yeah!
Bingo sinks to her knees and shakes her arms in the air.
Chilli: You did it, Bingo! (laughs)
Bingo: Yeaaaaaah!
Bluey: Again?
Bandit: Bluey, are we just playing again and again until you win?
Bluey: Maybe. (giggles)
The regular Bluey theme begins to play. They resume dancing, imitating the dances from the TV opening.
Bandit: All right. Woo hoo hoo!
The music pauses. Chilli keeps dancing for a moment. A stagehand holds up the word "MUM".
All Heelers and Audience: Mum!
Chilli steps back. They resume dancing.
The music pauses. Bandit keeps dancing for a moment. A stagehand holds up the word "DAD".
All Heelers and Audience: Dad!
Bandit steps back. They resume dancing.
The music pauses. Bingo keeps dancing for a moment. A stagehand holds up the word "BiNGO".
All Heelers and Audience: Bingo!
The music resumes. Bingo jumps into Chilli's arms, as Bluey dances by herself. As the song ends, she jumps as a stagehand holds up the word "BLUEY".
All Heelers and Audience: Bluey!
Bluey laughs. Bingo jumps down.
Bluey: That was fun! Can we play Keepy Uppy?
Bandit: Aw, nah. My battery's flat, kids.
Bluey: Well how will you charge it?
Bandit: By sitting on the beanbag.
Bandit plops down on the beanbag chair.
Bandit: Ahh.
Bluey: (whinging) No, no beanbag! You have to keep playing with us.
Chilli: Hey! I was gonna sit there.
Bandit: Nah, bagsed it this morning.
Bluey: He bean-bagsed it this morning.
Bandit: Heh heh! That's funny, Bluey.
He low-fives her.
Bingo': He bean-bagsed it this morning.
Bandit: And that's funny too, Bingo.
She's out of reach, so he attempts an air low-five.
Bluey: Heeey, she just copied what I said!
Chilli: Bluey.
Bandit pulls out a book.
Bandit: Hey, loud people! I'm trying to read my book!
Bluey and Bingo: (sarcastically) Oh, yeah, right.
Chilli: (sarcastically) Right. Your book.
Bandit: (indignantly) What?
Bingo: We know what you're really doing.
Bandit: What're you talking about?
Chilli: You say you're reading your book.
Bluey: But you're really just on your phone.
Bluey knocks the book to the floor, revealing that Bandit is, indeed, on his phone.
Bandit: Hey!
Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli laugh.
Bandit: I was just switching it to silent so as not to disturb my book reading—and for you to suggest otherwise, frankly, is outrageous!
He picks the book back up and makes a big show of reading.
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Chilli: Okay. So what's your book about?
Bandit: Oh. Um... It's the, uh, history of... the beanbag?
Bluey and Bingo squeal and giggle.
Chilli: Sounds fascinating.
Bluey: Daaad. Can you please play with us now?
Bandit: Nope.
Bluey: Aw, but I wanna play Keepy Uppy.
Bingo: I'll play with you.
Chilli: Yeah, Bingo will play with you. You love playing with your big sister, don't you Bingo?
Bingo: Yeah! It's my favourite thing in the whole world! And all the sky, including inside of the aeroplanes. And if all of the grains of sand were scattered on all of the stars, that's how much I love it. (giggles)
Chilli: What do you reckon, Bluey? Why don't you sister this thing out?
Bluey: Well... It's just more fun when Dad plays too. Ooh! I've got it!
Bingo: What is it?
Bluey: Bingo, let's steal Dad's phone! Then, he'll have to play with us!
Bingo: Hee-hee! Okay!
Bluey and Bingo sidle around, trying to act innocent.
Bluey and Bingo: Doo doo doo, doo doo doo.
Bluey: Sooo... Dad...
Bandit: What?
Bluey: If you're not using your phone... then you won't mind if I...
'Bluey reaches behind the book and snatches Bandit's phone.
Bluey: Grab it! Quick Bingo, hide Dad's phone!
Bandit: Noooooo...
Bluey throws Bandit's phone to Bingo. The stage lights darken as the phone flies across the stage in slow motion.
Bingo: Iiiveee gooot iiit!
Bingo catches the phone and stars to run out of the room. Bandit gets up to chase.
Bluey: Nooow, Muuum!
Chilli: Iii'm cooomiiing!
Bandit: Noooooo...
Bluey and Chilli: Aaaaaaaaah!
Chilli and Bingo tackle Bandit back into the beanbag chair, as Bingo makes her escape. The stage lights come back up and time returns to normal speed.
Bandit: Oof!
Bluey laughs.
Bandit: Get off!
Chilli: We're just making sure it doesn't disturb you.
Bluey: (sarcastically) Yeah, we wouldn't want it to stop you reading your booook.
Chilli laughs. Bandit groans and struggles.
Chilli: This beanbag is comfy, isn't it, Bluey?
Bluey: Oh, yes! Hee hee!
Bandit: Okay, fine. I don't want to read my book. I want to read about lawn grubs on my phone.
Bluey and Chilli: Hah! We knew it!
Bluey and Chilli laugh.
Bandit: Argh! Get off! (groaning) Heeeeee... yeah!
Bandit manages to throw them off.
Bluey and Chilli: Oof!
Bluey and Chilli laugh. Bingo comes back in, humming innocently.
Bingo: Hm-hmm, hm-hm-hmm.
Bandit: Where's my phone, Bingo?
Bingo: I hided it. (giggles)
Bandit: Ugh. Man...
Bluey and Chilli laugh.
Bluey and Chilli: Good one, Bingo!
Bluey Now I guess you'll just have to play with us.
Bingo: Yeah!
Bluey: (chanting) Play with us! Play with us!
Bandit gets up.
Bluey and Bingo: Play with us! Play with us!
Bandit: Where is it?! Come here, you!
Bandit chases Bingo out of the room to stage right.
Bluey: Look, Mum! Dad's playing with us!
Chilli: Good sister power, kid!
Bandit chases Bingo back into the play room from stage right.
Bandit: Tell me where it is!
Bingo: You'll never get me! Hah-hahahaha!
They exit stage left. Bluey and Chilli laugh.
Chilli: Get it, Bingo! Stick it to the man!
Bluey: Yeah! (laughs)
Chilli: Hey, Bluey?
Bluey: Yes.
Chilli: You have to let your sister copy you sometimes, okay?
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: She just wants to be like you, sweetheart.
Bluey: But I don't want her to copy me. I want her to be different. I don't want anyone being the same as me.
Chilli: I hear you. But you still have to let her do it, though. Okay?
Bluey: Okay, Mum. Why?
Chilli: Because that's how she learns to be a big kid.
Bluey: By copying me?
Chilli: Yeah. Little sisters look up to their big sisters. That's why she copies you.
Bluey: Oh, okay.
Chilli: So try and be a sister worth copying.
Bluey: Okay, I will. I'll be the best big sister I can be.
Chilli: That's my girl.
Bandit enters from stage left. He is holding Bingo by the foot, shaking her up and down.
Bandit: Talk! I said talk!
Bingo laughs.
Bingo: Okay, okay, I'll tell you.
Bluey: No! Don't tell him, Bingo, he'll stop playing.
Bandit: I haven't started playing. Grrr! Is it in your pockets?
Bandit shakes her side-to side.
Bingo: (laughing) I don't have any pockets!
Bandit: Ah, forget this!
He tosses Bingo onto the beanbag chair.
Bandit: (to Chilli) Can you ring my phone?
Bluey: No, Mum, don't do it!
Chilli: Well, I'm really not sure I can help you, Big Guy.
Bingo: Look, I'll give you fifty dollarbucks.
Chilli: Ooh, keep talking.
Bandit: Uh, and I'll... pack the lunches for a week!
Chilli: Oh, sorry kids. That's a good deal. I have to take it.
Chilli gets her phone out.
Bluey and Bingoo: Noo!
Bluey: I'll stop her, Bingo!
Bingo: Thanks, Bluey!
Bluey runs up to Chilli, who holds her at arm's length as Bluey flails her arms. Chilli laughs.
Bluey: Aw, Mum!
Chilli: Get!
She pushes Bluey back. Bluey gives up.
Chilli: Ah-ha! Okay, it's ringing.
Bandit: I can't hear it.
Chilli: Didn't you put it on silent?
Bandit: Ugh.
Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli laugh.
Bandit: (shushing) Shh! Shh.
The sound of a vibrating phone can be heard.
Bandit: I can hear it vibrating!
Bluey: Oh, no!
Bandit: It's coming from upstairs!
Bluey and Bingo: Nooo!
Bandit: Yeah! I'm coming, Phony!
Bandit exits stage left.
Chilli: Hey, where's my fifty dollarbucks?
Bluey: (to Bingo) If Dad finds his phone, he'll stop playing with us.
Bingo gasps.
Bluey: We can't let that happen, okay?
Bingo: Okay!
Bluey: Alright, let's go! Sister power!
Bingo: Sister power!
Bingo exits stage left. Bluey points at Chilli.
Bluey: Ohhh, we're not finished with you, Mother dear.
Chilli: Oh, Bluey.
They exit stage left.
The scene changes to Bluey and Bingo's bedroom. Bandit enters from stage left (the staging suggests he's in the hall outside). His phone can be heard vibrating.
Bandit: Where is that coming from? Under the sink? Nah.
He paces back and forth. Bluey's pillow begins to shake.
Bandit: Oh, it's close. It's so close. I can feel it. Where is it?
Bandit exits stage left. Blueys pillow lights up as it shakes.
Bandit: (offstage) Is it in the toilet? Aw, kids, you gotta flush!
The sound of a toilet flushing plays.
Bluey and Bingo enter their bedroom from stage left.
Bingo: I hid Dad's phone under your pillow.
Bluey: He's gonna hear it! What are we gonna do?
Bingo: Uh... think, Bingo! Think!
Bandit: (offstage) Hmm... Maybe it's down here.
Bingo: My little brain can't think of anything.
Bandit: (offstage) Oh, close.
Bluey: You can do it, Bingo! Keep trying.
Bingo gasps.
Bingo: I know! We have to be really noisy.
Bluey: Yeah! So he doesn't hear the phone!
Bingo: But how will we be noisy?
Bluey: Just copy me!
'Bingo gasps and wags her tail.
Bingo: Really? Can I? You sure?
Bluey: Yeah, I'm sure.
Bingo squeals in delight.
Bandit enters from stage left.
Bandit: Ah-ha!
Bluey and Bingo gasp, then giggle.
Bandit enters the bedroom. Bluey and Bingo stand on either side of Bluey's bed.
Bandit: I can hear it loud and clear, as it's very quiet in this room, currently.
Bluey giggles as Bandit examines Bingo's bed.
Bluey: One-and two-and
Bluey and Bingo: ♫ TEN GREEN BOTTLES, SITTING ON A WALL ♫
Bandit: Ah! Keep it down!
Bluey and Bingo: ♫ TEN GREEN BOTTLES, SITTING ON A WALL ♫
Bandit: I can't hear anything!
Bluey and Bingo: ♫ AND IF ONE GREEN BOTTLE SHOULD ACCIDENT'LY FALL ♫
Bandit: Stop, kids! Be quiet!
Bluey: Louder, Bingo!
Bluey and Bingo: ♫ THERE'LL BE NINE GREEN BOTTLES, SITTING ON THE WALL ♫
Bandit: Hey! Shh, shhh. You hear that?
Bluey pulls out a pot and wooden spoon.
Bingo: C'mon everyone!
Bluey: We need more noise!
Bluey bangs on the pot, as Bingo stomps around and the audience joins in.
Bluey, Bingo, and Audience: ♫ NINE GREEN BOTTLES, SITTING ON A WALL ♫
Bandit: Ah, kids! C'mon! It's so loud.
Bluey, Bingo, and Audience: ♫ AND IF ONE GREEN BOTTLE SHOULD ACCIDENT'LY FALL ♫
Bingo gasps.
Bingo: Bluey, look!
Bingo pulls Chattermax out from under her bed.
Bluey: Chattermax!
Chattermax's theme begins to play as it dances around. Bandit swats at it, without much luck. Bingo starts jumping on her bed.
Chattermax starts jumping on Bandit's head, and he tries to knock it off with a pillow. He finally knocks it under Bluey's bed, and it shuts up. Bandit gesture's at Bingo.
Bandit: C'mere, you little <sauna?>. Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Bandit holds his arms out for quiet. His phone vibrates once more, then stops.
Bandit: Gah, it stopped ringing!
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Bandit: CHILLI! CAN YOU RING MY PHONE AGAIN?
Chilli: (singsong) It'll cost you another week of lunches!
Bandit: Aw, man! Ripped off! Forget you! Hm... I reckon it's under that pillow.
Bandit points to Bluey's pillow.
Bandit: I might just take a look.
Bluey Aaah! Quick, Remote Control Bingo!
Bluey grabs a Long Dog off her bed and uses it like a joystick. She tests the controls, and Bingo skids around, making a "reeee" noise.
Bandit: Oh, no!
Bingo: Okay! Go!
Bluey rams Bingo into Bandit.
Bandit: Oooh! Ow! (laughs)
She rams him again.
Bandit: Ow! 
She rams him again.
Bandit: Hey!
He dodges the next attempt.
Bandit: Get away, Remote Control Bingo!
Bingo backs up and gets between him and the bed.
Bandit: Gotta get to my phone.
She zooms back and forth, blocking him, then rams him from the side.
Bandit: Oof!
She rams him again.
Bandit: Ugh!
He dodges the next ram attempt, and runs across the room.
Bandit: Aah, ha ha! Whoo! Hahahha!
Bingo rams him in the bum.
Bandit: Ow!
Bandit puts his hand on her head, and holds her at arm's length.
Bandit: Get out of there!
He pushes her back. He dodges the next ram attempt, then jumps up to the upper level of the stage, where the beds are.
Bandit: Whoa! Haha! Can't get me up here! Now, to check under that pillow.
Bingo attempts to follow him, but keeps bouncing off the step.
Bluey: He's gonna get the phone!
Bandit holds up the phone.
Bandit: Got it! Ha ha ha! Why play with kids when you can play with phones?
Bandit dances mockingly.
Bluey: Bingo, get the Magic Xylophone!
Bandit holds his phone up triumphantly.
Bandit: I have the POWER! Mu ha ha-ha ha! Mu ha ha-ha ha!
Bingo pulls the Magic Xylophone out from under her bed. Bandit continues to dance mockingly.
Bluey: Bingo, do a ding!
Bingo dings the xylophone. Bandit freezes.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray, Magic Xylophone!
Bluey and Bingo dress Bandit in a tutu, reindeer antlers, a feather boa, and Janet's granny glasses. They've replaced his phone with Chattermax.
When they're finished, Bluey and Bingo back off and laugh, as Bandit grunts and twitches as he "tries to move."
Bluey: Okay, Bingo, let's unfreeze him.
Bingo: Okay.
She dings the xylophone.
Bandit: Huh? What? Hey, what's going on? Oh, yeah! Kids never beat grown-ups! Ha ha ha!
He resumes dancing.
Bluey: Oh, well, we tried. Didn't we, Bingo?
Bluey: Yes, we tried.
Bluey giggles. Bandit strokes his chin.
Bandit: I'm just a bit too smart for you, I'm afraid.
Bluey: Oh, yes, you're so smart. Why don't you call Mum and tell her how smart you are?
Bingo: Bluey, can I say that too?
Bluey: Yeah, go for it, Bingo.
Bingo: Why don't you call Mum and tell her how smart you are?
Bandit Well, maybe I will. Hey Phony, call Mum.
Phony: Okay. Calling Mum.
Bluey pulls Bandit's phone out from behind her back.
Bluey: Oh, what's this?
Bluey answers the phone.
Bluey: Hello?
Bandit: Huh? That's my phone!
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: Then what am I holding?
He looks at Chattermax, who activates and starts dancing and playing music.
Bluey and Bingo dance as Bandit swats at Chattermax.
Bandit: Grrr!
Bluey: Bingo!
Bluey runs out of the room with the phone, followed by Bingo. They exit stage left.
Bandit: C'mere, you little rats.
Chattermax continues bouncing around the room as Bandit runs after them. He attempts to exit stage left, then runs back in, with a beach ball bouncing after him.
Bandit: (high pitched) Ahhh! Get away, get away! Don't! Ahh!
Bingo re-enters from stage left to giggle, then exits again.
Bandit exits stage right, pursued by a beach ball.
Chattermax continues dancing for a few more seconds, then his music starts to skip, he stutters, and drops into a basket.
As the scene changes to the back yard, the flock of rainbow lorikeets flies around again.
Two pairs of garden gnomes enter and have brief conversations before sitting down.
Gnomes: (gibberish)
The gnomes go still.
'Chilli enters from stage left with a load of laundry and sets it down. One more gnome takes its seat in the background. Bluey and Bingo enter from stage left, behind Chilli.
Bingo: Hey, Mum.
Chilli: What's going on?
Bingo: Bluey and I still have Dad's phone, and, she's letting me copy her! (giggles)
Chilli: Hey, nice one! You've got a good big sister, haven't you?
Bingo: Yeah, she's the best!
Bingo hops up on the bench under the poinciana tree and looks at Bandit's phone.
Chilli: (to Bluey) Well done, sweetheart. Thanks for being a good big sister.
Bluey: Oh, it's great. Bingo just does everything I tell her to. Watch. Bingo!
Bingo: Yes!
Bluey: Hide the phone in the backyard.
Bingo: Okay! (giggles)
Bingo jumps down and runs off.
Bluey: See? I'm her boss.
Chilli: Okay, well, that's not why you should be a good big sister.
Bluey: Oh! Well, then why?
Chilli: Let me explain. When you're a little sister, having a big sister is like having your very own giant. They can pick you up—
Chilli lift Bluey one-handed.
Chilli: —and you can see for miles.
Bluey: Oooooh.
Chilli: You feel like a giant, too.
Bluey: I love it!
Chilli: Feels good, doesn't it?
Bluey: Yeahhh.
Chilli sets Bluey down.
Chilli: Now you know how to do that, so use it wisely. That's a big part of being a good sister.
Bluey: How do you know so much about sisters?
Chilli: 'Cause I'm a sister.
Bluey: Really? Who's your sister?
Chilli: Auntie Brandy.
Bluey: Auntie Brandy!? I don't know Auntie Brandy! Have I met Auntie Brandy?
Chilli: Yeah, a long time ago.
Bluey: Well, I don't remember her.
Chilli: Well, we don't see her very often.
Bluey: Why not?
Chilli: It's complicated, sweetheart. Sometimes sisters start arguing and... just forget to stop.
Bluey: Oh...
Chilli: Look. You have to know — Bingo won't want to copy you forever, okay?
Bingo enters from stage right. She hides Bandit's phone under a bucket.
Bluey: Yes, she will. I'm the best big sister in the world!
Bingo: Hey, Bluey! I hid the phone under the bucket!
Bluey: Good one, Bingo! You are definitely the best phone hider in the whole world.
Bingo: Plus all of the sky?
Bluey: Yeah!
Bingo: Including inside all of the aeroplanes?
Bluey: Yeah!
Bingo: Wow! Thanks, Bluey!
Bandit: (offstage) Where are you, you little monkeys?
Bluey: He's coming!
Bingo: Ahh!
Chili: Good luck!
Bluey and Bingo jump up on the bench. Bandit enters from screen right.
Bandit: There you are! Where's my phone?
Bluey: Bingo! Pretend we can't hear Dad!
Bingo: Okay!
Bandit: Kiiids.
Bluey: Ohhh. Do you hear something, Bingo?
Bingo: No, Bluey. I don't hear anything.
Bandit: I said, give me my phone.
Bluey: Hm. Still don't hear anything.
Bingo: Mm. Must be the wind.
Bandit: Ugh. Forget you. I'll find it myself.
Bandit looks around for a moment.
Bandit: Aw, man. It could be anywhere. Aww... How could this day get any worse?
Pat: (offstage) Heads!
A rugby ball sails in from stage right and hits Bandit in the head. He falls down. Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: Aw, man! What was that?
Pat jumps in from stage right.
Pat: I'll get it, Lucky!
Lucky: (offstage) Okaaay.
Pat: Hey, kids! How ya goin'?
Bluey and Bingo: Hey Lucky's Dad!
Pat: What're you doin' on the ground, Bandit?
Bandit: You hit me with your ball.
Pat: Well, I called "heads."
'Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: Just help me up, ya big Labrador.
Pat: Hup!
Pat helps Bandit up. Pat walks across the stage, examining the ground.
Pat: Aw, look at this lawn! Bandit, you've got lawn grubs, mate. You need to spray it, and you need to spray it tonight. Didn't you read the article I sent?
Bandit: No, I didn't read the article you sent, because you send it to my phone, which the kids have hidden!
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: Now stop saying things, and ring my phone.
Bluey: Don't do it, Lucky's Dad! Don't ring it!
Pat: Why do you want me to ring your phone?
Bandit: I told you, the kids have hidden it.
Bluey: 'Cause we want Dad to play with us!
Pat: Aw, look. Just leave me out of this, okay? Every time I come over here, I get mixed up in some sort of shenanigans!
Bluey and Bingo waggle their eyebrows at each other, planning some sort of shenanigans.
Bandit: Look, it's two against one right now. I need some backup. Now stop moaning, and start phoning, or it's gonna be a lawn grub party for the whole street.
Pat: Oh, all right. Sorry, kids.
Pat gets out his phone.
Bluey and Bingo: No!
Pat: Man, I've gotta stop kickin' my ball over here.
Bingo: Oh no!
Bluey: C'mon, Bingo, I've got a plan!
Bingo: Okay!
Pat: Call Bandit Heeler.
Bluey and Bingo sneak off, stage left.
Phoney: Calling Bandit Heeler.
Pat: Okay, there you go. It's ringing.
Bandit's phone begins to buzz. The bucket shakes.
Bandit: (whispering) Shh. It's on silent. You've gotta listen for the vibrate.
Pat: Why's it on silent?
Bandit: Why aren't you on silent?
They listen for a moment.
Bandit: (whispering) Ah, it's coming from over here.
Pat: I can hear it.
They both start slowly walking in the general direction of the bucket.
Bandit: (whispering) Help me look, come on.
Pat: It's coming from over this way. Is it behind the tree?
Bandit looks behind the tree.
Bandit: Um... no.
Bandit: Where is it? (to audience) Does anyone know where it is?
Pat: Pause.
Bandit: Stop complaining.
Pat: Look, you can't blame me for not wanting to get involved.
Bandit: Aw, you big sook. We're just looking for a phone. What's the worst that can happen?
The Grannies theme starts to play.
Bluey: (offscreen) Here come the grannies!
Bluey and Bingo zoom in from stage left in their granny costumes, driving the pedal car. They run over some gnomes, then knock Pat up in the air. He does a full flip and lands on his feet.
Pat: Whoaaa!
Bandit dodges. They come back around and hit him too - he also does a full flip, but lands on his bum.
Pat: I didn't sign up for this!
The grannies come around for another pass, and knock both of them down.
Bandit: Yaaaah! Run!
Bandit and Pat get up and run off, exiting stage left.
Bluey: (old lady voice) Lovely day for a drive, wouldn't you say, Rita?
Bingo: (old lady voice) Sure is, Janet.
Bluey and Bingo exit stage left.
Bandit and Pat enter from stage left, behind the poinciana tree. They run towards stage right.
Pat: Why is it, every time I come over here, I get mixed up in some sort of trouble?!
Bandit: You should try living with us!
They both run off, exiting stage right.
Bingo and Bluey drive across the backdrop, knocking over hedges, flowers, and another garden gnome.
Bluey: (old lady voice) Can you see where you're going, Rita?
Bingo: (old lady voice) Not really, no.
The remaining two gnomes quake in fear, and kiss each other good-bye.
Bandit and Pat run in from stage right, panting.
Bandit: I think we lost 'em.
Pat: Oh no, not again!
Bluey and Bingo drive in from stage right, running over the last two gnomes, and then ramming into Bandit and Pat, knocking both of them over.
Bandit: Ow!
They back up, running into Bandit, and then pull forward, hitting Pat.
Pat: Ow!
They get up and limp towards the bench as Bluey and Bingo drive off.
Bandit: Oh, man. I've got a stitch.
They stand on the bench. Bluey and Bingo drive back in.
Bluey: (old lady voice) It's busy, isn't it, Rita?
Bingo: (old lady voice) Yes, Janet.
Bandit: Jump, Pat, jump!
Pat and Bandit jump off the bench just as Bluey and Bingo ram it. Pat clutches his leg.
Pat: Ah! I've done me hammy! 
Pat hops backwards, holding his leg.
Pat: That's it, Heeler, you're on your own!
He exits, stage right. The grannies pop a wheelie and drive off, exiting stage left.
Bandit: Okay, just don't stop ringing.
Bluey and Bingo: (offscreen) Aaaaah! 
A loud impact is heard.
Bluey and Bingo: (offscreen) Oof!
Pat: (offscreen) And spray your lawn!
Bluey and Bingo enter from stage left, still dressed as grannies, but on foot.
Bluey: (old lady voice) Good parking spot, Rita.
Bingo: (old lady voice) Thanks, Janet.
Bandit sneaks up behind them.
Bluey: (old lady voice) I hope the sausages are on special.
Bingo: (old lady voice) I love sausages.
Bandit: Gotcha!
Bandit yanks the granny costumes off. Bluey and Bingo squeal.
Bandit: Okay. Enough messing around. Time to fire up the Bingo Detector.
Bluey: Oh no!
Bandit picks up Bingo and holds her sideways.
Bandit: (activating the Bingo Detector) Brrrp! Badoot-doo!
Bingo giggles.
Bluey: Put her down!
Bandit I'll just set the dial to detect "phones"...
Bandit fiddles with Bingo's tail. Bingo giggles.
Bingo: Boop... Boop...
Bandit: Okay, there we go!
Bandit carries her across the stage. She continues booping.
Bluey: No, Bingo! Don't find the phone! Dad will stop playing!
Bingo: I can't help it! I am a Bingo Detector!
Bandit waves her around a bit, getting closer.
Bingo: Boop. Boop. Boopity Boopity Boop!
Bandit: Okay, here we go!
As they approach the bucket, Bingo boops faster.
Bingo: Boopboopboopboopboop!
Bandit tosses her down.
Bingo: Aaah!
Bluey: No!
Bandit kicks over the bucket. He picks up his phone
Bandit: Yeah-hah! Woo hoo hoo! Woo hoo, yeah!
Bingo giggles and jumps around excitedly.
Bandit: Woo woo woo! To the beanbag!
Bandit marches off, exiting stage right.
Bingo: What should we play now, Bluey?
Bluey: (grumpy) Nothing.
Bingo: What's wrong?
Bluey: Why did you show Dad where his phone was?
Bingo: I couldn't help it, I was a Bingo Detector.
Bluey: Now he's going to lie on the beanbag, and read about lawn grubs, and not play with us.
Bingo: I didn't do it on purpose, Bluey.
Bluey: You did.
Bingo: I didn't, I promise I didn't!.
Bluey: Hmph. You can't copy me anymore.
Bingo gasps. Bluey walks off.
Bingo: Bluey! Come back!
Bluey exits stage left. Bingo stops and looks down.
Bingo: I'm sorry.
Bingo sadly sits down on the bench. One of the leaves on the tree is revealed to be the walking leaf, as it separates from the tree and flies about. It lands on the bench.
Bingo: Oh, hello walking leaf.
It walks towards her. She reaches out, and it leaps backwards. It approaches again, and she reaches out - this time it takes flight and lands in her hand.
Bingo: Will you listen to me if I tell you something?
The walking leaf takes flight again, and lands on her nose.
Bingo: I'm not a very good little sister.
The walking leaf climbs to the top of her head, takes flight, and exits stage left. Bingo waves goodbye.
Bingo: Goodbye, walking leaf.
The lights go down. Bandit sits on a beanbag in the foreground, as the backdrops are changed behind him to the play room.
Bandit: A-ahhh... This beanbag has the perfect bean count. That's very rare to find.
He looks at his phone.
Bandit: "The life cycle of the lawn grub—" oh, no, skip that bit. "Natural predators of the lawn—" no, I don't care about...
Bluey walks in.
Bandit: "Common enemies of the lawn grub—" what? How d'you get rid of lawn grubs?
Bluey: Dad?
Bandit: Hello Daughter.
Bandit continues looking at his phone as he talks.
Bluey: Please can you play with me?
Bandit: Oh, look, kid. I've played with you all morning. I just need some time to myself, okay?
Bluey: But I don't understand why.
Bandit: Well, I told you, my battery's a bit flat.
Bluey: How long does it take to get full?
Bandit: Oh, well, you never really know. Depends how flat it was, I guess.
Bluey: Okay. Will you play with me again when it's full?
Bandit: Yeah, 'course. But in the meantime, why don't you go play with Bingo?
Bluey: (grumpily) Hmph. No.
Bandit looks up and watches her leave.
Bandit: Uh... Ah, she'll be right.
Bandit goes back to his phone.
Bandit: Wow. They can eat your whole lawn.
Bingo: Dad?
Bandit: Yes, Shorter Daughter?
Bandit continues looking at his phone as he talks.
Bingo: Bluey said I can't copy her anymore.
Bandit: Ah, well that's no good.
Bingo: (sadly) Nooo. Can I copy you instead?
Bandit: Yeah, yeah. Go for it.
Bingo: Oh, okay!
Bingo sits down on the floor, and pantomimes looking at a phone.
She checks on Bandit - no change. She goes back to looking at her phone.
She stands back up.
Bingo: Is this all you're going to do?
Bandit: You gotta spray three times?!
Bingo: Ughhhh.
Bingo walks away. Bandit puts his phone down.
Bandit: Hey, Bingo, where ya goin'? I thought you were copying me.
Bingo: It's a bit boring, copying you.
Bandit: Ah. (chuckles) Okay.
Bingo: I'd rather copy Bluey. But she's upset with me.
Bandit: Hey, Bingo.
Bingo: Yeah?
Bandit: Hut!
Bandit jumps out of the beanbag.
Bandit: Ha!

Bandit starts laughing. Soon, Bingo starts laughing too. Bandit ruffles her hair.
Bandit: Ah, well done, Bingo. Feeling better?
Bingo: Yeah, a little. Thanks, Dad.
Bandit: No worries.
Bingo exits stage left. Bandit sits back down in the beanbag chair.
Bandit (groaning) A-aah. Yes. Beanbag.
Bandit leans back and gets out his phone.
The scene changes to Bluey and Bingo's bedroom. Bluey is sitting on her bed, Chilli is sitting on the floor. There may be some dialogue missing.
Bluey: I'm not saying sorry to Bingo. 
Chilli: Okay.
Bluey: She made Dad stop playing. Pluuuus...
Bluey gets up.
Bluey: I was being a sister worth copying! I really was.
Chilli: I know you were, but you still upset her.
Bluey: I'm the one that should be upset! She should say sorry to me!
Chilli: I know. But look, you remember how, for little sisters...
Bluey sits down next to Chilli. Shadow puppets of Bluey and Bingo appear in the leadlight. Shadow Bluey lifts up shadow Bingo. Bingo raises her arms in joy and wags her tail.
Chilli: ...when your big sister is on your side, you feel as tall as a giant? Well, when your big sister is upset with you...
The shadow puppet of Bluey turns and leaves. Bingo falls to the bottom of the window.
Bluey howls.
Chilli: ... it can make you feel as small as a mouse.
The shadow puppet of Bingo is replaced with a shadow puppet mouse.
Chilli: Squeak, squeak.
The shadow puppet mouse paces back and forth in the leadlight.
Chilli: Like you can't do anything. Squeak, squeak.
Bluey: That doesn't feel as good as being a giant.
Chilli: No, it doesn't.
The shadow puppet mouse walks out the frame of the window and exits.
Bluey: It's hard, having a little sister.
Chilli: Yeah, one day they're copying everything you do, and the next they don't listen to a word you say. But there's good bits about sisters too.
Bluey: Like what?
Chilli: Well, who comes into your bed at night, when you get lonely?
Bluey: Bingo does.
Chilli That's right.
Bluey: Ooh, yeah, that's a good bit. Mum?
Chilli: Yeah?
Bluey: Did I make Bingo feel as small as a mouse?
Chilli: A little.
Bluey: I didn't mean to.
Chilli: I know. She'll be fine, Bluey.
Bluey: But what if she won't? What if she doesn't talk to me forever again?
Chilli: She'll talk to you forever again.
Bluey: But you and Auntie Brandy don't talk forever again.
Chilli looks away and sighs.
Chilli: Your Aunty Brandy and I will talk forever again.
Bluey: But when?
Chilli: I dunno. Someday.
Bluey: Did she make you feel as small as a mouse?
Chilli looks away again.
Chilli: (sadly) A little.
Bluey: I'm sure she didn't mean to.
They put an arm behind each other's back in a half-hug.
Bingo enters, stopping in the doorway.
Bluey: Hey, Bingo.
Bluey walks towards her.
Bluey: Can I show you something? 
Bingo: Okay.
Bluey: C'mere.
They meet at the foot of Bingo's bed.
Bluey: You ready?
Bingo: Yeah!
Bluey: Hup!
Bluey picks Bingo up.
Bingo: I'm as tall as a giant! (giggles)
Bluey: You're the best little sister in the whole world!
Bingo: Really?!
Bluey: Yeah!
Bingo: Plus all the sky?
Bluey: Plus all the sky, including inside all of the aeroplanes.
Bingo: Oooooh!
Bingo hops down.
Bluey: Even the aeroplane toilets.
Bingo laughs.
Chilli: Oh, Bluey.
Bandit enters.
Bandit: Hey-Heyo.
Bluey and Bingo: Dad!
Chilli: Oh, sweetheart, you go read about grass on your phone. I'm just about to put the kids to bed. We're okay, aren't we, girls.
Bluey: Yeah, we're okay.
Bandit: Ah, okay. Well, the thing is... my phone's flat. So, y'know... (hopefully) we could play one more game before bedtime?
Bluey and Bingo: Hurray!
Bluey: Copy me, Bingo! (chanting) Battery's flat!
Bingo giggles.
Bluey and Bingo: (chanting) Battery's flat! Battery's flat!
Bandit: What should we play?
Chilli: Well... I've got something, (addressing audience) but I have to turn all the lights off for it to work properly. Is that cool with everyone?
Bandit, Bingo, and Bluey: Yeah, that's cool.
Chilli exits to stage right.
Bandit: (whispering) Kids, come here.
Bandit turns off the lights. A disco ball creates spots of light suggesting the glow-in-the-dark stars.
Bandit: (whispering) What's it gonna be?
Bluey and Bingo giggle. Chilli enters with a lit-up red balloon.
Chilli: Glow-in-the-dark Keepy Uppy anyone?
Bandit: Yeaaah!
Chilli tosses the balloon up in the air.
Chilli: Ready?
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!
Chilli: Okay, go!
As the balloon falls back down, she swats it across the stage.
Bingo: Get it, Bluey!
Bluey: Mine! I got it! Bwut!
She hits the balloon back to Chilli.
Bluey: Get it, Mum!
Chilli': Bwut!
Chilli hits the balloon back across the stage.
Chilli: Get it, Dad!
Bingo: Get it, Dad!
Bandit: Aye mate, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it! Doot!
He hits the balloon with his head. Bingo giggles.
Chilli: Get it, Bluey!
Bingo: Get it, Bluey!
Bandit: Bluey that’s yours, it’s yours!
Bluey: Bwut!
Bluey also hits it with her head.
Bingo: It's you, Dad!
Bandit: Hup!
Bandit swats it directly at Bingo. It bounces off her nose, back at Bandit.
Bingo: Bwut!
Bandit: Bloop!
Bandit hits it into the air.
Chilli: It's yours, Bluey!
Bluey: Boop!
Bluey kicks it back into the air.
Bluey: Ah, Bingo, quick!
Bingo: I got it, Bluey!
Bingo bounces it back up with her head. The balloon drifts downstage.
Chilli: Go go go go!
They all move closer to the audience.
Bandit: Get it!
Chilli: I got it!
Chilli takes center stage, getting under the balloon and hitting it back up with her head.
Bluey laughs.
Bingo: It’s going dad, get it dad!
Bandit: I got it! Doot!
Bandit hits it with his bum.
Bluey: Mum! Bwut!
Bluey hits the balloon into the air.
Bluey: Mum, Mum, that's yours!
Chilli gets under it and hits it with her head.
Bluey Good one, Mum.
Bandit: Bingo, it's yours, get it!
Bingo: Bwut!
She hits it into the air.
Bandit: I'll get it, I'll get it! I got it, I got it, I got it!
The balloon comes to rest, balanced on Bandit's head.
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: Doot!
Bandit jumps, launching the balloon back into the air.
Bingo: Get it, Mum!
Chilli: Oh!
Chilli hits it up.
Bluey: Get it, Dad!
Bandit catches the balloon under his arm.
Bandit: Okay, kids. Bedtime.
Bluey: (whispering) Bingo, copy me.
Bluey and Bingo jump on their beds a few times. Bingo giggles. They lay down in bed and pull up the covers.
Bandit: Well done, Mum.
Chilli: Well done, Dad.
They turn to leave.
Bandit: (whispering) Ohhh, I left my phone in there.
Chilli: (whispering) I'll get it.
Chilli sneaks back into the bedroom and picks up Bandit's phone. It dings and the screen turns on. Chilli gasps.
Bluey: Boop!
Bluey and Bingo both sit up, eyes closed. Bluey has Long Dog set up like a joystick, and she pilots Remote Control Bingo across the room, to her bed.
Bingo: Rrrr! Vrrrrvrrrvrm! Reeer!
Bingo hops in, and they snuggle.
Bingo: Vmmmm.
Chilli sneaks out, joining Bandit in the hall.
Chilli: (amused) I thought you said the battery was flat.
Bandit: Oh, um, must've been a little left in the tank?
They lean close for a moment.
Chilli: Actually, do you mind if I borrow it for a second?
Bandit: Sure thing, babe. I got a date with some lawn grubs.
Bandit exits, stage left. The lights go down, with only a dim spotlight on Chilli remaining. She dials the phone. It rings twice.
Brandy: Hello?
Chilli: Hey, Brandy. It's your little sister.
The lights go down.
The stage lights come back up. An arrangement of the main theme plays. Chilli enters from stage left.
Chilli Woo hoo!
Bandit enters from stage left.
Bandit: Hey! Yeah!
Bingo runs in from rear stage left.
Bingo: Yeah!
Bluey runs in from rear stage right. Chilli laughs. Bluey jumps in front of the audience.
Bluey: Woo!
Bandit: Good work, Bluey!
Four of the puppeteers release the puppets and take a bow, while the other four take over operating the puppets. They trade places with their partner puppeteers, who also bow. They gesture to the audience, and clap as well. They return to operating the puppets.
Bluey giggles. They start to dance along to the music. Pat enters from rear stage right.
Bandit, Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli: Lucky's Dad!
Pat waves and takes a bow, then exits stage right.
Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo: Mum!
Chilli takes a bow and then waves with both hands.
The music adds an electric guitar riff for a moment, and Bandit plays air guitar.
Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli: Dad!
Bandit takes a bow, then waves.
Bandit, Bluey, and Chilli: Bingo!
Bingo takes a bow.
Bandit, Bingo, and Chilli: Bluey!
Bluey jumps up and waves with both hands. When she lands, all four puppets take bows and wave to the audience.
Chilli: (to audience) Who wants to play...
Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo: Keepy Uppy!
The Keepy Uppy theme begins to play. Stage hands emerge, hurling large, soft rubber balls into the audience. The Heelers yell encouragement to the audience.
Bluey: Yeah!
Chilli: Go on everyone!
Chilli: Yeah!
Bluey: Get it!
Bandit: Look at that kid with the flash hair! He's goin' for it!

Bandit: Whoo!
Bingo pretends to strum a guitar.
Bandit: Whoo whoo whoo! Ya hoo hoo!
