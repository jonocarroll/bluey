The episode starts in the living room, with Bandit pretending that is a bus driver and singing.
Bandit: "The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round."
Bandit: "Bus stopping! Psshhh."
Bandit: "Doors opening."
Chilli, looks at the Bandit. She wears a pink hat. She comes in.
Bandit: "Hello, passenger. Where are you off to?"
Chilli: "Boop. Museum, please."
Bandit: "Oh, OK."
Bandit: "Doors closing! Pshhh."
Bandit: "The wheels on the bus go round and round."
Bandit: "There's not much traffic today, so we should be there very soon."
Chilli: "Oh, great!"
Bandit: "Unless something slows us down, of course. But that probably won't happen."
Bandit: "Pshhh. Door op--"
Bandit: "Oh, no."
Bluey and Bingo appear, wearing some "old" clothes and Bluey some sunglasses, pretending they are grannies.
Bluey, Bingo: "Here come the grannies!"
The sound track begins.
TITLE CARD: BUS
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called... Ah, I forget."
Bluey: "Boop."
Bingo: "One granny to mahjong, please."
Bandit: "Ahh!"
Bingo: "Oops-a-daisy."
Bandit: "Listen here, you two. I don't want any trouble out of you."
Bluey: "I don't know what you're talking about."
Bingo squeezes a yellow balloon, making a very shameful sound.
Bingo: "Hee-hee."
Bandit: "Oh, good gravy. Oh!"
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bluey: "Is this seat taken, dearie?"
Chilli: "It's all yours."
Bluey: "Where are you heading, love?"
Chilli: "Oh, just to the museum."
Bluey: "Oh, you should catch the 19 bus. It will get you there faster."
Bingo: "No, Janet, you'll want the 21."
Bluey: "Oh, you don't know what you're talking about."
Chilli: "Actually, I catch this bus because I'm secretly in love with the bus driver."
Bluey: "Oh, really?"
Bluey: "He's bit hairy, isn't he?"
Chilli: "Not for me."
Bluey: "Oh, well, wonderful. You two can get married and have bus babies."
Bluey tries to get up.
Bluey: "I'll let him know."
Chilli: "No!"
She pulls Bluey back.
Chilli: "I'm not ready to tell him yet."
Bluey: "But you have to. We're almost at your stop."
Bingo squeezes again the ballon.
Bandit: "Oh, for goodness..."
Bingo laughs.
Chilli: "I will tell him. I just.. need more time, OK?"
Bluey: "Oh, well, we can slow the bus down for you."
Bluey ring a bell.
Bluey: "Next stop, please, driver."
Bandit: "Huh?"
He wonders.
Bandit: "But the next stop's the sausage shop. Thought you were going to mahjong?"
Bluey: "No, I need some sausages."
Bandit: "OK. Pshhh. Here we are. Doors opening!"
Bluey: "Thank you."
She remains staring for a bit, and then goes back.
Bluey: "Ah, changed my mind."
Bandit: "Oh, OK. Doors closing! Brooom, broom-broom, broooom."
Bluey: "Next stop, please, driver."
Bandit: "But the next stop's the library."
Bluey: "Yeah, I need a cookbook."
Bandit: "OK. Pshhh. Doors opening! There you go."
Again, remains staring for a bit, and then goes back.
Bluey: "Actually, I can't read."
Bandit: "Ugh! Passengers should only ding the bell if they intend to get off! Is that clear?"
Bluey whispers to Chilli.
Bluey: "Tell him you love him."
Chilli sais loud.
Chilli: "No!"
Bandit: "What do you mean 'no'?"
Chilli: "I mean, yes, it's clear."
Bandit: "Good. Doors closing! Brrrrroom.
Bluey dings the bell.
Bandit: "Oh! The next stop is the motorbike shop!"
Bluey: "Oh, good."
Bandit: "What? You wanna buy a motorbike?"
Bluey: "Yep."
Bandit "Grrr."
Bandit: "OK, bus stopping. Pshhh. Doors opening! There's the motorbike shop. Go and buy a motorbike."
Bluey: "Oh, there's no pink ones."
Bandit: "Grrr! Right, that's it! Pshhh! Doors closing! Vroom! No more stops until the museum, and then you're ALL getting off!"
Bluey: "You have to tell him now, dearie. You're running out of time."
Chilli: "Oh."
Bingo: "Where's Boopsie gone?"
Chilli: "I can't. I'll do it tomorrow."
Bluey: "Oh, today is better than tomorrow."
Bingo: "Oh, Boopsie?"
Bandit: "Bus stopping! Pshhh! Off!"
Bingo: "I can't find Boopsie."
Chilli: "Who's Boopsie?"
Bluey: "Her snake."
Camera switches to Bandit having a toy snake wrapped up on his neck.
Bandit: "Arggh!"
Bingo: "Oh, there you are Boopsie."
Bandit: "Get it off! Get it off! Ooh! Arggh! Arggh!"
Bandit jumps out of the bus.
Bluey: "Naughty Boopsie!"
Chilli: "Quick, grab its head!"
Bandit: "Get it off!"
Bingo: "Oh, no. We're gonna be late for mahjong."
Chilli: "Suck the poison out!"
Bingo: "Brrmm-brmm-brmm-brmm!"
Chilli: "Hey, why's the bus moving?"
Bluey: "Oh, Rita's driving."
Chilli: "Oh, OK. What?! Rita's driving?!"
Bingo: "The something on the bus go round and round..."
Rita (Bingo) hits a sheep with the bus.
Bandit: "Baa."
Bandit yells at her, throwing the snake off and catching up the bus.
Bandit: "Stop! Come back here! That's my bus!"
Chilli: "Quick, do something, Janet!"
Bluey: "Oh, time for a nana nap."
Chilli: "Janet!"
She is dreaming on the bus' bench.
Bluey: "Raoww, sausages."
Bingo: "Beep-beep."
She hits another sheep.
Bandit: "Baa."
Chilli is trying to take her back to her seat.
Chilli: Come on, Rita, back to your seat, honey."
Bingo breaks the steering wheel.
Bingo: "Ugh! Whoopsie."
Bingo: "Arggh, the steering wheel!"
Chilli takes her up and pretends that all went crazy.
Chilli, Bingo: "Ahhh-whoa-ahhh! Ahhh!"

Bluey: "Raoww, cookbook."
Chilli: "Why don't I take this, Rita?"
Bingo gives the steering wheel to Chilli.
Bingo: "OK, you have fun, love."
Bandit: "Stick it back in the thing!"
Chilli: "OK, OK! There. The steering wheel's fixed. Now what do I do?!"
Bandit: "Hit the brakes!"
Chilli: "Where are the brakes?!"
Bandit: "They're down there! The big brown block!"
Chilli: "What big brown block?!"

Bingo: "I love a good lamington. Nom-nom-nom."
Bandit, Chilli: "Arggh!"
Chilli: "Rita's eating the brakes!"
Bluey: "Next stop, please, driver."
Chilli: "We can't stop!"
Bingo squeezes again the yellow ballon, making that shameful sound.
Bingo: "Oh, excuse me."
Chilli: "Oh, Rita!"
Chilli makes some false coughing.
"That's not helping!"
Bandit: "Uhh! Ooh! Ah!"
Bandit jumps back in the bus.
Bandit: "Hoo, made it."
Chilli and Bandit are sitting side by side.
Chilli: "Oh, hello."
