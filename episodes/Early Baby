The episode opens to an exterior view of the Glasshouse Primary School; the sky is green due to the rain. A chicken outside on the lawn clucks. 
The scene cuts to inside. Honey, Indy (carrying a purple baby doll), and Bluey (wearing a nurse’s hat) stand at one end of a table, while Rusty stands at the other. Calypso sits between the two parties. 
Bluey: You ruined our game, Rusty!
Rusty: No, you ruined my game.
Indy: (points at Rusty) You can’t play with us. 
Rusty: (points back) You’re being mean.
Rusty stomps his foot. Calypso holds out her arms to calm the argument.
Calypso: Okay, okay, calm down, children. Let’s get to the bottom of this. Rusty, tell us your side of the story.
Rusty wipes his nose.
Rusty: Okay, Calypso. I was walking along to Cozy Corner…
The scene transitions to a flashback. Rusty is wearing a cardboard knight helmet with a large orange and green feather attached. He hobbles as he walks over to a rounded playfort, carrying a purple baby doll in with one arm.
Rusty: Hello, doctor ladies!
Inside the fort, which has a picture of a red cross taped to the opening arch, stand Bluey, wearing a nurse’s hat, and Honey, who notice Rusty with looks of stunned silence. Indy, sleeping on a red bean bag and covered with a pink blanket, blinks awake with the same look.
Rusty: Do you sell crutches?
Bluey and Honey flinch back and Indy springs up, knocking off the blanket, as all three girls scream in horror. Thunder rumbles in the background.
The scene returns to the present day.
Rusty: And they all went crazy! They just started yelling at me.
Calypso: Oh, that’s odd.
Rusty: (nods) Yeah.
Calypso: (turns to Bluey) Bluey, what’s your side of the story?
Bluey: Well, we were playing doctors in a baby hospital.
The scene transitions to a flashback again. Honey is fluffing up the red bean bag in the playfort. Chloe and Indy sit on a nearby bench with puffed out blankets, pink and green respectively, tied around their waists.
Bluey: Next!
Chloe moves over to sit on the bean bag and Honey steps to the side.
Bluey : We were delivering everyone’s babies for them.
Bluey: Ooh, here comes your baby!
As Bluey reaches into Chloe’s blanket bump, Honey waves a bluish-purple cloth.
Honey: I’ve got a wet flannel.
Bluey pulls out a green bonneted baby doll and holds it up high.
Bluey: Pop! It’s a baby boy!
Chloe claps excitedly as she unties the blanket from around her waist. Bluey hands her the baby doll as Honey wipes the side of her head with the cloth.
Chloe: Thanks! I’ll call him Max.
Chloe stands up and walks away with her baby doll. Honey fluffs up the bean bag again.
Bluey: Congratulations. Next!
Indy: Ooh! That’s me!
Indy gets up from the bench and moves to the bean bag.
Bluey : Indy wanted to play “Early Baby”, like her sister in real life.
Indy: Bluey, can we pretend my baby is coming, but it’s coming too early?
Bluey: Oh, okay!
Indy: (dramatic voice) Doctor! I think my baby is coming!
Indy feigns a swoon.
Bluey: Great! But, isn’t it supposed to come this afternoon?
Bluey looks at her wrist as if looking at an imaginary watch. Honey does the same and nods.
Indy: Yes, it must be early!
Bluey and Honey gasp.
Bluey and Honey: Early baby!
Bluey and Honey raise their arms in excitement.
TITLE CARD - Two wooden figurines: one, made of dark brown wood, has a tall crown and a long beard, while the other, made of lighter reddish wood, has a tall pointed hat and a tiara. The second has a full neutral expression, while only the nose is visible on the other.
Bluey : This episode of Bluey is called Early Baby.
Indy is clutching her blanket bump nervously.
Indy: I’m a bit worried.
Bluey: Everything’s gonna be fine, Indy!
Honey waves her cloth again.
Honey: I’ve got a wet flannel.
Bluey reaches into the blanket bump.
Bluey: Here it comes!
Bluey pulls out a purple bonneted baby doll and holds it up triumphantly.
Bluey: Pop! 
Bluey, Indy, and Honey: Hooray!
Bluey: It’s a boy!
Indy unties and discards the blanket around her waist.
Indy: (hushed) No, it’s a girl.
Bluey: I mean- It’s a girl!
Bluey hands the doll to Indy. Two close up views show the doll in her arms, then Indy’s face looking back wonderstruck.
Indy: Hello.
The scene returns to its usual view.
Indy: I’m calling her… (draws out for a moment) Polly.
Bluey: Great! Okay, who’s next?
Indy: No, Bluey. Because Polly’s an early baby, she needs to stay in the hospital for a long time, ‘cause she’s still very small.
Bluey: Oh, oh, okay. We can take care of her.
Honey waves her cloth yet again as Indy tenses up.
Honey: I can use my wet flannel!
Indy: Thanks, but before you touch her, you have to wash your hands with soap.
Bluey looks over her hands as Honey drops her cloth.
Honey: Got it.
Honey finds a cylindrical wooden block and a stick on the ground nearby, setting them up as a makeshift sink on the bench nearby. She gestures towards her completed setup.
Honey: This is where you wash your hands, everyone.
Indy is standing up from the bean bag.
Indy: Yeah. But we need to put her in, uh… it’s like a fish tank with holes in it.
Bluey: Aha!
Bluey turns to find a clear fish tank full of ping-pong balls behind them. She dumps it out onto the floor.
Bluey: What about this?
Indy: Yes!
Bluey rushes over to place the clear tank on a nearby table, the other two girls following her.
Bluey: I’ll put Polly in for you.
Bluey reaches out for Polly.
Honey: Un-uh-uh! You need to wash your hands.
Bluey: Oh yeah, I forgot.
Bluey moves over to the “sink” and rubs her hands together under the stick representing the faucet. She returns to Indy’s side, taking Polly from her and gently setting the doll in the tank. 
Bluey: There you go, Polly.
Indy reaches over to turn on a nearby arched desk lamp in the windowsill.
Indy: She likes reading lights.
Bluey: Great. Now what, Indy?
Indy: (hushed) Mums aren’t allowed to stay at night, so you need to tell me to go home to sleep.
Bluey: (hushed) Oh, okay.
Indy: But I’ll pretend that I don’t want to leave Polly. 
Bluey: Got it. (normal voice) Okay now, sweetheart, we’ll look after her.
As Bluey and Honey lead her away, Indy feigns a swoon again.
Indy: (dramatic) But I don’t want to leave Polly!
Bluey: You have to be the bravest you’ve ever been.
Indy: Okay, I’ll be the bravest I’ve ever been!
Indy presses her hands to the side of the fish tank.
Indy: Goodnight, Polly.
Indy, looking back at Polly wistfully, is led away by Bluey and Honey. As they walk off screen, Snickers, holding a wooden figurine, with a green dragon tail around his waist. He lets out a roar.
The scene cuts back to the playfort. Bluey is tucking in Indy, who is laying on the bean bag and falling asleep, with a pink blanket. Honey is wiping the side of her head with her cloth.
Bluey: It’s okay, Indy. We’ll take good care of her. 
As Honey leans forward, her glasses shift down her nose and she readjusts them.
Bluey: (whispering) She’s asleep!
Bluey and Honey attempt to tiptoe away when they notice Rusty hobbling towards them. Polly is no longer in the fish tank, instead being in Rusty’s hand.
Rusty: Hello, doctor ladies. Do you sell crutches?
All three girls flinch and scream in terror. Thunder rumbles behind them.
The scene returns to the present where the group remains in stunned silence before Rusty breaks it.
Rusty: Ohh, I see. I’m sorry, Indy. I didn’t know Polly was your early baby.
Calypso nods understandingly.
Indy: That’s okay, Rusty. You can play with us if you want.
Rusty: Great.
Calypso: You just have to follow the rules of their game.
Bluey: Yeah, come on.
Rusty: Okay.
The kids all laugh. As they try to walk away, Calypso stops them.
Calypso: Oh, um, before you all go, can I ask a question?
Bluey, Honey, and Indy: Sure.
Calypso: Rusty, why were you looking for crutches?
Rusty: Oh! Well…
The scene transitions to another flashback. Coco is arranging various shapes of blocks to make a castle on top of a low table. Rusty is adding wooden figurines with pointed hats in front of the castle, where two figurines, one with a crown and one with a tiara, are already set.
Rusty : Coco and I were building a castle out of blocks…
Snickers runs into the scene wearing a dragon tail. He roars.
Rusty : …when a huge dragon came.
Snickers continues to roar as he circles Coco and Rusty.
Coco: Aah! The dragon’s back! Run, everybody!
Rusty : Every day, he would come to take one villager to eat.
The view zooms in on the wooden figurines in front of the castle. Coco grabs the crowned figurine, waving it back and forth.
Coco: (as the king figurine) Go away, dragon!
Snickers roars again as the scene zooms back out.
Snickers: Give me a villager, or I’ll breathe fire on your whole town!
In the zoomed in view, Coco grabs one of the “villager” figures and waves it around.
Coco: (as the villager figurine) Oh, my. What shall we do?
Coco sets the figure back down.
Rusty : The townsfolk had no choice. 
The scene returns to the present.
Rusty: They gave a villager to the dragon.
The girls gasp.
The flashback resumes, still zoomed in on the castle.
Rusty : To decide who it would be, they played “Ip Dip Sky Blue”.
The scene briefly zooms out as Rusty picks up one of the villagers. Zooming back in, Rusty bumps each of the other figures with the one he picked up as he goes through the rhyme.
Rusty: Ip dip sky blue. Who’s it? Not you. 
The scene zooms back out. Snickers and Coco are watching with fascination.
Rusty: Not because you’re dirty, not because you’re clean. 
The scene zooms back in.
Rusty: My mum says you're the fairy queen!
Rusty’s bumping of the other figures ends on the figurine with the tiara. 
The scene zooms back out to show Coco’s shock.
Coco: They chose the king’s daughter.
Zoomed back into the castle, Coco moves the king figurine.
Coco: (as the king figurine) Oh no! I’m so upset! I’ll give my castle to whoever takes her place.
Coco : But, no one would.
The villager pieces are shuffled around to nod “no”.
The scene returns to the present. Everyone but Rusty looks worried. Honey’s hands are over her mouth.
Rusty: But, the king’s daughter was very brave.
Rusty puts a hand over his heart profoundly.
The flashback resumes. Rusty is moving the tiara-wearing figurine.
Rusty : She said to the king-
Rusty: (as the king’s daughter) Goodbye, father.
The scene briefly zooms out.
Rusty: (as the king’s daughter) We both have to be the bravest we’ve ever been.
Coco: (as the king) No!
Coco hands the king’s daughter figurine to Snickers.
Snickers: Hooray!
Snickers roars and runs away.
The scene zooms back in on the castle.
Coco: (as the king) Oh, my only daughter is gone! Who will bring her back to me?
The scene zooms back out to show Rusty wearing a cardboard knight’s helmet with a feather and carrying a wooden sword and a cardboard shield.
Rusty: I will, Your Majesty. I’m a knight. 
Rusty holds up his sword triumphantly.
The scene shows an overhead view of the king figure.
Coco: (as the king, gasps) Aren’t you scared?
The view cuts back to Rusty.
Rusty: Yes, Your Majesty, but I will be the bravest I’ve ever been.
Rusty runs to the other side of the room. Coco’s tail is wagging giddily.
Rusty : So the knight set off.
The scene shows Indy putting her hands against the side of the fish tank holding Polly.
Indy: Goodnight, Polly.
Bluey and Honey lead Indy away.
Snickers runs into view, roaring and carrying the king’s daughter as Rusty follows him.
Rusty: Yeah! Sausage dragon! I command you to free the king’s daughter!
Snickers: Never! I’ll eat her now!
Snickers opens his mouth, but Rusty cuts him off, pinching the Polly doll and taking her out of the fish tank.
Rusty: (stage whisper) Here, use this instead. It looks more like a daughter. 
Snickers drops the wooden figure as he takes the baby doll.
Snickers: (normal voice) Okay.
Snickers roars.
Rusty raises his sword as the scene zooms in on him.
Rusty: Put her down!
The zoom in cuts to Snickers.
Snickers: You can’t stop me!
The scene zooms back out as Rusty chases Snickers around the table.
Rusty : So the knight fought the sausage dragon with all his might!
In the present, Rusty is making dramatic motions and grunts, nearly flopping onto the table.
Back in the flashback, Rusty has dropped his sword and is pulling on Snickers’ dragon tail as he roars. The velcro comes undone, leaving the tail in Rusty’s hands, and Snicker and Rusty exchange confused looks.
Rusty : And the brave knight won…
Snickers yells and runs away, tossing Polly into the air. Rusty slides on his knees to catch her. He licks his finger and pretends to rub something off of the doll’s face.
Rusty : …and rescued the king’s daughter.
Rusty: You’re safe now.
The scene returns to the present.
Rusty: But the brave knight was hurt very bad.
Rusty gestures dramatically. The girls look shocked.
The flashback resumes.
Rusty: I need to get to a hostable.
Rusty puts Polly up to his ear, pretending she’s whispering to him.
Rusty: Oh! There’s one over there! Thanks.
Rusty points toward the playfort. He gets up and hobbles towards the girls.
Rusty: Hello, doctor ladies. Do you sell crutches?
The three girls flinch and scream in terror as thunder rumbles.
The scene returns to the present day, the girls looking stunned. 
Bluey: Ohhh! 
Bluey’s composure quickly recovers.
Bluey: Let’s play Knights and Dragons!
Bluey and Honey: Yeah!
Bluey and Honey giggle as they run off to play. Calypso gets to her feet and walks off to the side, ruffling Rusty’s ears as she passes.
Calypso: Good boy, Rusty.
Indy looks over at Rusty, who is idly wagging his tail. She moves to the other side of the table, the new angle showing that the rain has stopped and there is a large arching rainbow outside the window.
Indy: Rusty, let’s play Mums and Dads.
Indy smiles as she hands Polly over to Rusty, who gladly takes her.
Rusty: Okay.
Bluey dances as the credits theme, an upbeat violin rendition of the episode’s soundtrack, plays.
