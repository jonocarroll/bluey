Mum: OK, let's make some Father's Day cards for Dad.
Bingo: I'm going to do a red love heart rainbow card.
Mum: Oh, great!
Dad: Hey, what's going on?
Mum, Bluey and Bingo: Argh! Dad, get out!
Dad: Oh! After all I've done for this family!
Mum: OK, what about you, Bluey?
Bluey: I'm gonna draw the perfect picture of me and Dad.
Mum: The perfect picture?
Bluey: Yes.
ㅤㅤㅤ What does perfect mean?
Bingo: I know!
ㅤㅤㅤ It means really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good.
Mum: Pretty much.
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Perfect.
Bluey: This is going to be so perfect. Dad will stick it straight on the fridge.
Mum: Perfect is tough, Bluey. I'm just warning you.
Bluey: It's fine. Oop! It's not straight. Start again. It has to be perfect!
ㅤㅤㅤ What should I draw me and Dad doing?
Mum: How about just standing there with your arms out, exactly like this one?
Bluey: No, it has to be better than that.
Mum: But this one's lovely.
Bluey: But it's not on the fridge.
Mum: Uh, no, I guess not.
Bingo: What do you like the best of what Dad does?
Bluey: Ooh, I know! I love it when he does, "It's Dad!"
Bingo: Oh, yeah!

Dad: It's Dad!
ㅤㅤ OK, listen up. Whenever I walk into a room, everyone has to clap and go, "Whoo! Yeah! It's Dad! Alright! That guy's awesome!" Got it?
Mum, Bluey and Bingo: Got it.
Dad: OK, let's try that again.
ㅤㅤ It's Dad!
MUM CLAPS SLOWLY

Bingo: Ooh! You can draw Dad playing Chair.
Bluey: Oh, yeah!
FLASHBACK
BLUEY PLAYING WITH SQUEAKY TOY
Dad: Oh, man, my legs are tired from all this child rearing. Surely sitting down on a comfy chair will do the trick. Oh, look, I have my choice of any chair I want. Where to sit? Here will do.

ㅤㅤㅤHe'd love it more if you put some care into it.
Bluey: And made it...perfect?
Mum: No, not perfect. Just the best you can do.
ㅤㅤㅤCome on, what can you draw where we see you and Dad?
Bingo: With no big couches or tickling.
Bluey: But throwing is fine.
Mum: Bluey and Bingo: Hmm.
Bluey and Bingo: Ooh, Boomerang!
Mum: Boomerang?
FLASHBACK
Fido: It was all pretty quick, really. It was just in and out and I even got to keep them.
Bluey: Oh-oh-oh! Whoa!
Dad: Hey! Oh, man, I'm sick of this boomerang. Do you want a boomerang, Fido?
Fido: No, my boomerang supplies are plentiful.

Bluey: Whoa!
Dad: There. That's the last we've seen of that boomerang.
Fido: Because you threw it away.
Dad: Look, I'm keen to get it done, but, Chilli, she wants to keep her options open. But I don't know. Do we want anymore of these things running around?
ㅤㅤ Ooh! Eh!
END FLASHBACK
Mum: That's a cracker!
Bingo: That's what Boomerang looks like.
