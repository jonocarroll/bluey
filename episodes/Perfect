The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heelers' house. It's morning.
Bluey and Bingo are sitting at a low table on the back verandah. The table is covered in art supplies and stacks of drawing paper. Bingo is drawing with a red crayon. Chilli takes a seat on an open stool, with a mug of tea.
Chilli: "Okay, let's make some Father's Day cards for Dad."
Bingo: "I'm going to do a red love heart rainbow card."
Chilli: "Oh, great!"
Bandit walks up, making a cocky entrance.
Bandit: "Hey, what's going on?"
Chilli, Bluey, Bingo: "Argh! Dad, get out!"
Bandit folds his arms and walks away, mock offended.
Bandit: "Oh! After all I've done for this family!"
Bluey starts cutting a piece of paper to size with a pair of safety scissors.
Chilli: "Okay, what about you, Bluey?"
Bluey: "I'm gonna draw the perfect picture of me and Dad."
Chilli: "The perfect picture?"
Bluey: "Yes. ...What does perfect mean?"
Bingo: "I know!"
Bingo waves her crayon to emphasize each "really".
Bingo: "It means, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really... good."
Chilli: "Pretty much."
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
TITLE CARD: Perfect
Bluey: (voiceover) "This episode of Bluey is called: Perfect."
Bingo has changed to a yellow crayon.
Bluey: "This is going to be so perfect; Dad will stick it straight on the fridge."
Chilli: "Perfect is tough, Bluey. I'm just warning you."
Bluey: "It's fine. Oop! It's not straight..."
She tosses her sheet of paper in the bin and gets a fresh one.
Bluey: "Start again. It has to be perfect!"
The scene cuts to a spider web, beaded with dew that shines in the morning light.
It cuts back to Bluey's viewpoint. She holds a blue marker, hesitating to draw on a blank white card.
Bluey: "What should I draw me and Dad doing?"
The scene returns to a third-person view.
Chilli: "How about just standing there with your arms out, exactly like this one?"
Chilli gestures to a drawing of Bluey, attached to an easel.
Bluey: "No, it has to be better than that."
Chilli: "But this one's lovely."
Bluey: "But it's not on the fridge."
Chilli: "Uh, no, I guess not."
Bingo: "What do you like the best of what Dad does?"
Bluey: "Ooh, I know! I love it when he does, 'It's Dad!'"
Bingo giggles.
Bingo: "Oh, yeah!"
The scene cuts to the Heelers' kitchen. Bluey and Bingo are reading at the breakfast bar. Chilli is cooking. Bandit enters from the living room, and holds his arms out, as though expecting praise.
Bandit: "Iiit's Dad!"
No one acknowledges him. Chilli shakes some spices into a pot.
Bandit:"' "Okay, listen up."
Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli turn to look at him.
Bandit: "Whenever I walk into a room, everyone has to clap and go, 'Whoo! Yeah! It's Dad! Alright! That guy's awesome!' Got it?"
Chilli, Bluey, Bingo: "Got it."
Chilli, Bluey, Bingo return to what they were doing.
Bandit: "OK, let's try that again."
Bandit leaves, then enters again, arms held out expectantly.
Bandit: "Iiit's Dad!"
Everyone turns to look at him. Chilli slowly claps, twice.
After a moment, Bluey and Bingo giggle. Bandit jumps forward and starts tickling Bluey. Bluey laughs.
Bandit: "Pick up your game!"
The scene returns to the present. Bluey has drawn a card showing Bandit picking her up to tickle her.
Chilli: "That looks great, Bluey!"
Bluey: "Mm, I can't draw tickling very perfect."
Bingo: "Yeah, it looks more like he's throwing you."
Bluey: "Ooh, I can draw throwing!"
Bingo: "Ooh, you can draw No Ticket!"
The scene cuts to the sitting room. Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo are sitting on the couch. She is reading them a picture book.
Chilli: "And he built his house out of straw. Hm, bad move, pig."
Bandit walks up to Bingo, clears his throat, and holds out his hand.
Bandit: "Ticket."
Bingo: "Oh, yes. Here you go."
Bingo pretends to get a ticket out of her pocket and hands it to Bandit. She giggles. Bandit pretends to take and punch it.
Bandit: "P-chuck."
He holds his hand out to Chilli.
Bandit: "Ticket."
She searches her pockets.
Chilli: "Oh, yes, of course. Oh, what did I do with it? It's here somewhere."
Bandit: (warningly) "Ticket!"
Chilli: "Oh, here it is!"
She pretends to hand over a ticket, which Bandit punches.
Bandit: "P-chuck. Quicker next time.
Bingo giggles again. Bandit holds out his hand to Bluey.
Bandit: "Ticket."
Bluey: "Oh, uh, I don't have one."
Bandit snaps from a bored expression to an angry one. Bluey shrieks.
Bandit picks her up, and tosses her onto a beanbag a few feet away. He dusts his hands. Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit hooks his thumb over his shoulder, and explains:
Bandit: "No ticket."
The scene returns to the present. She has drawn Bandit throwing her onto a beanbag, as Bingo and Chilli watch from the couch.
Chilli: "Beautiful, Bluey. I think Dad will like that."
Bingo: (annoyed) "Dad's games are always too rough."
Bluey: "Hmm, I'm not very perfect at drawing big couches."
Chilli: "It looks great!"
Bingo: "Yeah, it doesn't look like our couch."
Bluey: "It looks more like a chair."
Bingo: "Ooh! You can draw Dad playing Chair."
Bluey: "Oh, yeah!"
The scene transitions to the living room. Bluey plays with a stress ball. It squeaks each time she squeezes it.
Bandit enters from the kitchen. He stands in the middle of the room.
Bandit: "Oh, man, my legs are tired from all this child rearing. Surely sitting down on a comfy chair will do the trick. Oh, look, I have my choice of any chair I want. Where to sit? Here will do."
He sits down directly on Bluey. She shrieks.
Bluey: "Dad! Get off!"
Bluey giggles and tries to struggle.
Bandit: "Oh, wow. Sitting in this chair was definitely the right decision. So relaxing!"
Bluey: "Get off!"
The scene returns to the present. Bluey has drawn Dad sitting on a chair, with herself squished underneath him.
Chilli: "The chair looks like a chair. Good to go."
Bingo: "But you're not really in it."
Bluey: "Yeah, it's supposed to be a picture of Dad and me."
Chilli: "Bluey, it's fine. It doesn't have to be perfect. Dad will love anything you do."
Bluey: "So if I gave him this, he'd love it?"
Bluey draws a wavy line. Bingo giggles.
Chilli: "Well, um, yes."
Bingo: "Will he love this?"
Bingo draws a straight line.
Chilli: "Yes, he would."
Bingo: "Really?"
Bluey: "This?"
Bluey draws a dot.
Chilli: "Okay, okay. Yes. He'd love it more if you put some care into it."
Bluey: "And made it...perfect?"
Chilli: "No, not perfect. Just the best you can do. Come on, what can you draw where we see you and Dad?"
Bingo: "With no big couches or tickling."
Bluey: "But throwing is fine."
Chilli, Bluey, Bingo: "Hmm."
Bluey, Bingo: "Ooh, Boomerang!"
Chilli: "Boomerang?"
The scene cuts to a park. There is evidently a party going on in the background, with streamers and balloons. Fido and Bandit are talking.
Fido: "It was all pretty quick, really. It was just in and out and I even got to keep them."
Bluey runs in, spinning.
Bluey: "Oo-ooh-oo-ooh-ooh-oo! Whoa!"
She crashes into Bandit.
Bandit: "Hey! Oh, man, I'm sick of this boomerang. Do you want a boomerang, Fido?"
Fido: "No, my boomerang supplies are plentiful."
Bandit: "Well, what am I gonna do with this boomerang?"
Fido: "Well, maybe just throw that boomerang away."
Bandit: "Oh, yes, of course. I'll throw the boomerang away. That will do it."
Bandit grabs Bluey, and shoves her. She takes off running and spinning.
Bluey: "Whoa!"
Bandit dusts his hands.
Bandit: "There. That's the last we've seen of that boomerang."
Fido: "Because you threw it away."
Bluey runs through the background, spinning.
Bluey: "Oo-ooh-oo-ooh-ooh-oo..."
OriginalDisneyBandit: "Look, I'm keen to get it done, but, Chilli, she wants to keep her options open. But I don't know. Do we want any more of these things running around?"Bandit: "Yeah, I know, I probably should get it done. But I love my dog teeth. I dunno, what if one day I just wanna bite someone?"
Bluey crashes into Bandit again.
Bluey: "Ooh!"
Bandit: "Hey!"
The scene returns to the present. Bluey has drawn Bandit, throwing Bluey high into the sky.
Chilli: "That's a cracker!"
Bingo: "That's what Boomerang looks like."
Bluey sets her marker down, looking sad.
Chilli: "What's wrong this time?"
Bluey sadly walks down the verandah steps.
Bluey: "I don't know. It's just not perfect enough."
Chilli: "Perfect enough for what?
Bluey sits down on the bottom step. She draws circles on the railing with her finger. Chilli sits down beside her.
Chilli: "Is there something you want to tell me, Bluey?"
The scene cuts to the laundry room. Chilli is putting laundry in a basket. Bingo runs up with a piece of paper.
Bingo: "Mum, I drew you a picture!"
She hands the picture to Chilli. It shows a red flower and a pair of purple butterflies.
Chilli: "Oh, wow."
Bingo: "Do you like it?"
Chilli: "Yeah, it's perfect."
Bingo: "Hooray!"
Chilli: "That's going straight to the fridge.
Chilli and Bingo stand in front of the fridge. It is covered with drawings already.
Chilli: "Not much room up here. Hmm. Look, I'm just going to put it on top of Bluey's for now."
She lifts up a magnet, and slides Bingo's drawing on top of a drawing of Bluey and Chilli holding hands, with a love heart. Bingo and Chilli admire it happily.
Chilli notices something, and steps aside. The music stops. Bluey is standing behind her, holding a box of cereal and a bowl. She stares, open-mouthed.
Chilli: "Oh! Hi, Bluey."
The cereal box falls from Bluey's hand.
The scene returns to the present.
Chilli: "I'm sorry, kid."
Bluey crawls into Chilli's lap. Chilli rubs her back.
Chilli: "I'm not perfect I'm afraid."
Bluey: "That's okay."
Chilli: "Being a parent's tough."
Bluey: "So is drawing."
Chilli: "Yeah, so is drawing."
Bluey sits back down.
Chilli: "But listen, how many times have you banged your knee or scratched yourself playing with your dad?"
Bluey: "Hmm..."
The scene cuts to Bandit and Chilli's bedroom.
Bandit: "No ticket!"
Bandit throws Bluey onto the bed. She shrieks and giggles, and bounces right off the side.
Bluey: "Argh!"
Bandit: "Whoop! Ooh!"
Bandit walks around the side of the bed. Bluey is rubbing her knee.
Bandit: "You right, mate?"
Bluey: "Um, yeah, I just banged my knee."
The scene changes to the party at the park.
Bandit winds up to give Bluey another shove.
Bandit: "I am sick of this boomerang!"
He gives her a shove, seeing too late that Bingo is standing directly in her path, holding a slice of cake. Bingo shrieks.
The scene cuts back to the present.
Bluey: "Lots."
Chilli: "And what's the first thing he always says?"
Bluey: "Um..."
The scene cuts back to Bandit and Chilli's bedroom.
Bandit: "Don't tell your mum."
The scene cuts back to the present.
Chilli: "What?!"
Bluey giggles. Bandit walks up, and holds his arms out wide to receive praise.
Bandit: "It's Dad!"
Chilli growls and gives him an angry stare. Bandit backs away sheepishly.
Bandit: "Uh, I'll come back later."
Chilli rolls her eyes and turns back to Bluey.
Chilli: "What else does he always say?"
The scene cuts back to the bedroom. Bandit makes a fist, showing off his bicep.
Bandit: "Well, Bluey, it's a good thing you're tough."
The scene cuts to the park. Bingo and Bluey are sitting on the ground, covered in cake. Bingo licks cake off her hand. Bluey is holding her upper arm.
Bandit makes a fist, showing off his bicep.
Bandit: "It's a good thing you're tough."
The scene cuts to the back yard. A pair of tire tracks lead to the bushes, where the pedal car is crashed. Bluey, fur mussed, stands with Bandit. They both clench their fist, showing off their biceps.
Bandit: "It's a good thing you're tough."
The scene returns to the present.
Chilli: "So, yeah, drawing is tough, but..."
Bluey: "It's a good thing I'm tough?"
Chilli: "Yep!"
Bingo: "Finished!"
Bingo holds up her drawing.
The scene cuts to a wide exterior shot of the house.
Bluey, Bingo: "Happy Father's Day!"
Bandit: "Oh, thanks, kids! Oh, look at these pictures. These are brilliant! They're going straight to the fridge."
The scene cuts to the kitchen. The fridge is now empty of art, holding only magnets and some bills.
Bandit: "Out of the way, power bill."
Bandit plucks a bill from the fridge, and throws it behind him. Bluey and Bingo giggle.
He hangs Bluey and Bingo's drawings, front and center.
Bandit: "There. Perfect!"
All three of them admire the drawings. We see what they've drawn - Bluey has drawn Bandit and Bluey, showing off their biceps. Bingo has drawn their house, surrounded by love hearts, and topped with a glittery rainbow. Soft light illuminating motes of dust give the scene a magical quality.
 END CREDITS
 The music of the episode gets slower and simpler as the credits begin, reduced to just a violin and plucked guitar. Bluey runs across the screen while spinning, playing Boomerang.
