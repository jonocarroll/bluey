The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler house in daytime.
Cut to the dining room. Bluey and Bingo are sitting at the table, playing with modeling compound. Chilli is standing at the counter, filling out a stack of forms. Bandit walks in from the deck. He squats down between Bluey and Bingo.
Bandit: "Whoa, that looks great, girls!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Thanks!"
Bandit straightens up, and taps Bluey on her opposite shoulder. Bluey turns to look.
Bluey: "Huh? Ugh."
Bluey glares at Bandit.
Bluey: (annoyed) "Da-ad."
Bandit: (innocently) "What?"
As Bluey goes back to her modeling compound, Bandit taps Bingo on the opposite shoulder. Bingo turns to look.
Bingo: "Yes? Huh?"
She turns to look at Bandit.
Bingo: (annoyed) "Dad!"
Bandit: "Why is everyone saying my name with that intonation that suggests I'm doing something annoying?"
Bandit walks over next to Chilli, and taps her on the opposite shoulder. Chilli doesn't look up.
Chilli: (curtly) "Whadda you want?"
Bandit: (feigning surprise) "What? Nothing."
Chilli looks at him.
Chilli: "You just tapped me on the shoulder."
Bandit: "No I didn't."
Bluey and Bingo glare at him, as Chilli has already turned her attention back to her paperwork.
Bluey, Bingo: "Yes, you did!"
Bandit: "But I'm standing over this side of you. Which shoulder was tapped?"
Chilli: (exasperated) "Bandit."
Bandit: "There's that intonation again."
Chilli puts down her pen and turns to face the rest of the family.
Chilli: "Looks like we have a mystery tapper on our hands."
Bandit: "Ah! I know who can help us solve this."
Cut back to an establishing shot of the Heeler house. While it is still daytime, the shadows are comically exaggerated in size and darkness, evoking a "film noir" style.
Bandit: (doing a goofy voice) "It was a Tuesday when this dame walked into my life."
Cut to the office. The lights are off and the blinds are down, creating a clear pattern of sunlight from the slats of the blinds. Bandit's feet are visible below the desk, and he holds up the bear puppet behind the desk. It's reclining, with its hands behind its head. Chilli walks in, wearing a pink hat.
Chilli: "Evening, Mr Browny Bear. I have a case for you."
Chilli sits down in the office chair opposite Browny Bear.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "I'm all ears."
Chilli speaks, apparently explaining the situation, but her lines are indistinct.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "She spoke, but I drifted off after the first sentence."
The camera cuts to Browny Bear playing air drums at his desk.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "Sometimes, I like to pretend that I'm the drummer for Led Zeppelin."
Bandit: (making drum noises) "...ba-doom boom sheesh! Boom shee sheesh!"
Chilli: "So can you help me?"
Browny Bear stops drumming and straightens his tie.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "Oh, sorry. What did you say?"
Chilli rolls her eyes.
Chilli: "Ughh."
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "So she explained it again."
Cut to a close shot of Chilli.
Chilli: "Someone is tapping people on their shoulder, and when you turn 'round to look, there's no-one there. I need you to find out who is doing it."
Cut back to a wider shot. Browny Bear is playing air drums again.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "But I drifted off again."
Bandit: (making drum noises) "Boom! Sheesh! Boom-boom shee shoo!"
Chilli: "Ugh, forget it."
Chilli gets up and walks away, as Browny Bear continues to air drum.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "She seemed annoyed. Why? I guess we'll never know. But then—"
Bandit: (making drum noises) ".. shee shee sh-shee sh-shee!"
Bandit taps Browny Bear on the shoulder. Browny Bear turns, seeing no-one there. He turns dramatically to the camera, which zooms in on his face.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "—it got personal."
Cut to the kitchen, still with exaggerated shadows. Bluey is loading the dishwasher. Browny Bear "walks" up behind her.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "So I took on the case."
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "I just need to ask you a few questions, ma'am."
Bluey doesn't turn around, continuing to load dishes.
Bluey: "Okay."
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "Do you know of any bands looking for a drummer?"
Bluey: "Huh?"
Cut to the back yard. Bingo sits at a table, smiling as Browny plays air drums.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "It was slow going."
Browny Bear's drumming knocks over a mug of markers. Bingo laughs.
Cut to the play room, again with dramatic shadows. A pair of benches are set up in front of the play house, forming the suggestion of a bar counter. Browny Bear sits next to a yellow teddy bear with a toilet paper bandage on its head.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "The case was going nowhere."
A yellow card slides along the bar, stopping in front of Browny Bear.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "But then it stopped going nowhere, and it went somewhere."
Cut to a view of the card over Browny Bear's shoulder. It is Bandit's driver license.
Cut to the laundry room. Bandit irons a garment on an ironing board with one hand, holding up Browny Bear with the other. In addition to the dramatic shadows, the room is filled with steam.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "I paid a visit to the one they called 'the big blue guy.'"
Bandit: "I dunno what you're talkin' about, mate! If I tap someone on the shoulder, I make sure I tap the shoulder closest to me, so when they turn and look at me, I'm there, and I start talkin' to them. You know what I mean?"
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "Something wasn't adding up. Sure, he was incredibly handsome, but he was a little too talkative."
Cut to a close up on Browny Bear.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "But I had a plan."
Cut to the playroom. Browny Bear is having a clandestine meeting with Bingo in the plaid hat and moustache from her "husband" outfit."
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "First, I needed to set the trap."
Brownie Bear offers her a lolly, which she puts in her mouth. Then she hands him a vial of glitter. They nod at each other.
Cut to the upstairs hallway. Bandit taps Bluey on the shoulder. She turns around and gasps.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "Meanwhile, things were getting out of hand."
Cut to the living room, where Chilli is sitting on the couch. Bandit reaches over the back of the couch and taps her shoulder. Chilli turns and gasps.
Cut to the red hallway. Bandit taps Bingo on the shoulder. Bingo turns around and gasps.
Cut to the entranceway. Bandit taps himself on the shoulder.
Bandit: "Noooo!"
Cut to the establishing shot of the exterior of the house and Bandit's scream lingers.
Cut back to the living room, where the lighting has returned to normal. Bingo, Bluey, and Chilli sit on the couch opposite Bandit and Browny Bear.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear, talking on a pretend phone) "I can't talk right now, Shanice, I've got a work thing. Boop!"
Browny Bear hangs up and addresses the Heelers.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "I've brought you all here to tell you it is someone in this room!"
Bandit gasps. Bingo, Bluey, and Chilli roll their eyes.
Chilli: "How do you know that, Browny Bear?"
Cut to the sunroom, where the noir lighting has resumed. Chilli reads a book, oblivious, as Browny Bear shakes some glitter onto her shoulder.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "I've sprinkled some glitter on the shoulders of all of you while you weren't looking."
A short montage shows him putting glitter on Bingo, as she has a pretend tea party in her bedroom, on Bluey, as she works on a puzzle in the entryway, and on Bandit as he sits on the toilet in the en-suite bathroom.
Cut back to the living room with normal lighting.
Bingo: "Why?"
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "So that anyone who taps you on the shoulders will get glitter on their fingers."
Bingo, Bluey: "Ooh, good idea!"
Chilli: "So we just need to all show our fingers, and the one with the glitter on it will be the culprit."
Cut to a close-up of Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli presenting their index fingers for inspection. They are all clean.
Bandit as Browny Bear, Bingo, Bluey, and Chilli clear their throats.
Bingo, Bluey, Chilli, Bandit: (Bandit as Browny Bear) "Dad."
Bandit: "Um, I just need to, uh..."
Bandit climbs halfway out of his seat.
Bandit: "...call my accountant?"
Bluey: "Get him!"
Bingo, Bluey, Chilli, and Browny Bear leap on Bandit, tickling him. After a moment of struggling and laughing, Browny Bear gets hold of Bandit's free h and and presents it for inspection. There is glitter on his finger.
Bingo, Bluey, Chilli : "Ah-ha! Gotcha!"
Bingo, Bluey: "Hooray!"
Cut back to the office, where Browny Bear is once more behind his desk. The film noir lighting has resumed.
Bandit: (as Browny Bear) "Another case solved, and I can go back to what I do best."
Browny Bear begins to air drum again.
Bandit: (making drum noises) "Brr-rt-t-t-t doo, brrt-dt-t-doo!"
