The episode opens on the front lawn of the Heeler house. Bandit and Bingo are leaving in the car, while Bluey and Chilli wave from the porch.
Bluey: Bye, dad!
Chilli: See you later!
Bingo: Bye!
Bandit honks the horn.
Bluey: See you Bingo!
Thunder rolls. Music featuring primarily plucked and strummed guitar begins to play. A heavy rain begins to fall. There is no further dialogue in the episode.
Chilli and Bluey glance at each other, then run off the porch.
Chilli carries a laundry basket to the side of the house and takes down the laundry. Bluey dances in the rain.
TITLE CARD - Rain
The title card shows three building blocks. No one reads the episode title. Instead, the rain and music continue.
The scene cuts back to Bluey dancing in the front yard, and Chilli taking down the laundry.
Cut to a dark blue rainy sky. Thunder rolls, the distant lightning illuminates the clouds.
Cut to the roof. Beads of water roll down the ridges in the metal roof.
Cut to the gutter. As drops of water from the roof turn into streams, the gutter fills and water flows to the downspout.
Cut to the base of the downspout. A trickle of water flows out, onto a splash block covered in leaves. The trickle turns into a gushing torrent, and water flows along the fence to the front walk.
Cut to the front lawn. Bluey is spinning around, trying to catch raindrops in her mouth. She notices the stream flowing down the front walk.
Bluey stops, and jumps into the stream, jumping over and over, then kicks the water to make a bigger splash.
She decides to block the water with her feet instead. The water builds up and flows around her feet, so she crouches down, and blocks it with her hand as well. As the water flows around her hand, Chilli finishes taking down the washing, and runs it to the front porch. She ducks inside the front door and comes back with an umbrella.
Chilli yells something to Bluey.
Bluey perks up and runs to get the umbrella. Back at the front walk, she opens the umbella, sets it down, and tries to use it to block the stream. Chilli notices, but lets it go.
Too much water flows into the umbrella and Bluey loses her grip. She tips out the umbrella, folds it up, and tosses it away. After looking around for a moment, she notices a plastic-wrapped newspaper.
She blocks the stream with her feet again, then uses the newspaper to extend her dam. As the water builds up, it pushes the newspaper out of the way. Bluey has an idea and runs off.
Back at the porch, Chilli walks out of the house and lays down on the deck chair. Bluey runs past her into the house, leaving a trail of puddles and leaves. Chilli gets back up, surprised.
Cut to the playroom. Bluey grabs a handful of building blocks, and runs back out.
Cut to the front door. Chilli freezes Bluey in her tracks with her Death Glare. They talk over each other. Chilli gestures with frustration at the mess on the floor, and then the door. Bluey excitedly points outside as she talks.
Chilli gestures at the mess again, and Bluey halfheartedly tries to clean up a puddle by rubbing it with her foot. Chilli gestures "out" by pointing her thumb over her shoulder, and Bluey runs outside.
Back at the front walk, Bluey straightens out the newspaper, then uses her blocks to build a longer dam. She holds the newspaper in place with her hands, but the blocks begin to wash away. Bluey puts her hands on her hips and considers the problem.
Chilli comes out on the front porch with a mop and towel. She sets the mop by the front door, and folds the towel on the porch. She points at the towel very emphatically.
Chilli sits back down in the chair. Bluey runs up on to the porch and grabs the towel, taking it out to the yard. Chilli looks shocked.
Bluey straightens up her dam, then rolls up the towel. She uses the rolled towel to reinforce the blocks. It works for a moment, but then the newspaper starts to wash away again. She moves the towel to hold the newspaper in place too - and a block starts to wash away. She thinks for a moment.
Cut to the laundry room. Chilli is grabbing another towel out of a cupboard. Bluey snatches it out of her hands and runs out, leaving a trail of puddles and leaves. Chilli protests.
Back at the the dam, Bluey rolls up the second towel and reinforces the newspaper. Her dam is less than halfway across the walk, and soon water is flowing past the edge again. Wordless vocals join the music. She uses her feet to extend the dam, then crouches down and uses both hands as well. The water still flows past.
Cut to the front porch. Chilli comes out the front door of the house, walking backwards while mopping up Bluey's trail of puddles. She spots Bluey running up the front walk.
Chilli desperately tries to block the front door. She leans sideways to block with her shoulder, then sits down and uses the mop to block Bluey as she tries to go low. She moves the mop side to side several times, blocking Bluey. Then Bluey gets her head under Chilli's arm.
The shot cuts the entrance, we see Chilli's back in the door. One of Bluey's arms and then the other pops past her barricade. Then her head pops free.
The shot cuts back to the porch, Chilli strains with effort as Bluey pumps her legs for traction.
Cut to a wider shot that contrasts the water flowing around Bluey's dam with Bluey squirming through her mother's blockade.
Cut to the entrance. Bluey squeezes past Chilli and runs inside; Chilli falls over backwards and lays there with her eyes closed.
In the playroom, Bluey picks up a dollhouse and runs back out.
In the entrance, she runs past Chilli, who is still laying in the doorway.
Back at the dam, Bluey adds the dollhouse to her construction.
Chilli sits back down on her chair. The music fades.
Chilli: (sighs audibly)
Chilli watches Bluey adjust her dam, as a new musical theme comes in, featuring bowed strings and harp.
Chilli's annoyed expression changes to a smile.
Cut to another shot of the sky. Thunder rolls, and distant lightning illuminates the storm clouds.
Cut to the roof. Water rolls down the ridges.
Cut to the gutter. Water pours down the hole to the downspout.
Cut to the downspout. Water gushes out onto the splash block.
Cut to Bluey's dam. She's extending the dam with her feet and hands again. Still, her dam is not quite long enough.
As the water is about to pass Bluey's fingertips, the music swells. Chilli's feet step into frame, extending the dam further.
Bluey cheers up noticeably. Chilli, holding an umbrella, just shrugs.
The dam is still not quite long enough. Bluey says something.
Chilli sighs, and discards the umbrella. She crouches down and uses her hands to extend the dam, finally reaching all the way across the walkway.
As the water nearly reaches the other side of the walkway, both their tails start to wag furiously -- but the rain stops, and the water is no longer advancing. The two look up at the sky.
Cut to the roof. The last few drops of water roll down.
Cut to the gutter. The last water flows down the hole to the drainpipe.
Cut to the drainpipe. The water slows from a gush, to a trickle, to drips.
Cut to the dam. The waters begin to drain away. Chilli and Bluey stand up, and hold out their hands to feel for raindrops. There are none. Bluey sighs, and Chilli puts her hand on Bluey's back, then pulls her in for a side hug.
The clouds part, and yellow sunlight illuminates the scene. Bluey notices something, and points toward the cul-de-sac. Chilli turns to look.
A double rainbow stretches across the sky.
Chilli and Bluey stare in awe. Chilli pulls Bluey in for another side hug, and their tails wag slowly.
The rainbow fades. Bluey turns and picks up the dollhouse. Chilli gestures dismissively, and Bluey puts it back down. The both walk towards the porch.
Thunder rumbles, and the light dims. They both look to the sky. The music dies down to just a harp.
Over the rooftop, storm clouds are illuminated by lightning.
Heavy rain begins to fall again.
Cut to the gutter, filling with water once again.
Cut the downspout. A trickles turns into a gushing torrent.
Cut to the front walkway . Chilli and Bluey hold out their hands to feel the rain. Water begins to stream down the front walk.
Bluey turns around to follow its progress, Chilli follows it with her eyes.
They make eye contact, and the music swells as they both run towards the dam.
The full arrangement of the episode music with all instruments plays during the credits. Bluey is replaced by the discarded umbrella.
