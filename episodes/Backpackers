We open on the Heeler House. Giggling from Bluey, Bingo and their cousins can be heard coming from outside. We cut to inside, where there is a statue of a dog playing a flute while on a ox is on the table. Bluey, Bingo, Muffin and Socks pop up behind the table and look at the statue. We cut back to reveal Chilli, who is eating some cereal with fruit, and Bandit, who is polishing a glass with a rag.
Muffin: What's this, Aunt Chilli?
Chilli: It's a souvenir I got backpacking Muffin. It brings good luck.
Bandit: It's doesn't work.
Chilli: Dont listen to him.
Muffin: What's backpacking?
Bluey points to a picture that's hanging on the wall. It depicts Bandit and Chilli smiling in front of the Taj Mahal.
Bluey: It's where you go on a holiday, and you carry everything you own in the backpack.
Muffin: Can we play it?
Bluey : Yeah. We can be the backpacks.
Bluey points at Bandit and Chilli.
Bluey: Mum and Dad have to carry us around.
Bandit and Chilli look concerned at the choice of game chosen.
Kids: Yeah!
The kids laugh and leave the table, leaving the kitchen.
Bandit: I told you it doesn't work.
The episode's title card is shown. This episode of Bluey is called: Backpackers. The dog riding the ox statue is shown on top of the title.
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called: Backpackers.
We open to the porch, Bandit and Chilli are walking out to the backyard, while holding the kids. Chilli is holding Muffin and Socks, and Bandit is holding BLuey and Bingo.
Bandit: Well that was a pleasant two-day train ride.
Chilli spreads her arms out, gesturing to what she sees.
Chilli: Look! A whole new city to explore!
Bluey moves a finger up to tickle Bandit's ear while buzzing softly. She appears to be imitating a mosquito.
Bandit: Ah! Get out of it!
Bandit waves his hand around his ear to try and swat the mosquito.
Bandit: What's with all these flies?
All of the kids laugh.
Bandit swivels his body around, causing Bluey and Bingo to giggle and latch on more.
Bandit: Man, these backpacks are so heavy.
Chilli: Let's find a place to stay then.
Bluey: (whispering) Mum, you need to look in the guidebook fora hotel.
Chilli: I need to look in the guidebook for a hotel.
Chilli leans in and starts looking around the Bluey backpack, causing Bluey to laugh.
Chilli: Right, where's that guidebook? It's in here somewhere.
Chilli appears to have found something.
Chilli: Aha!
Sbe pulls out the dog riding the ox statue from before.
Bandit: What is that?
The kids laugh.
Chilli: I bought it from someone on the train. She said it would bring good luck.
Bandit: Ah, you ding-dong!
Chilli moves in to put the statue back and start searching for the guidebook again. Bluey laughs as she searches around in the backpack. After a bit, she finally finds the guidebook.
Chilli: Aha! Here it is!
Chilli starts to pull it out, but she ends uo meeting some resistance from Bluey.
Muffin: Don't let go, Bluey!
Chilli keeps pulling, Bluey resisting a bit longer until she finally lets go of the guidebook.
Chilli: Right down the bottom! Got it!
The kids laugh.
Chilli: I'll find us a nice hotel in the guidebook.
Bingo: (whispering) You're very hungry.
Bandit: I'm very hungry.
Bandit looks to the right and sees something.
Bandit: Hey look! Some guy's selling croiussants!
We cut to a stand with a gnoee with some seed pod plants acting as croissants in baskets are there.
Bandit: I'kk be right back.
Bandit walks off to go get croissants.
Chilli: Please don't eat too many.
We cut back to the croissant stand. Bandit walks up to the gnome.
Bandit: Bonjour, mate.
Bingo: (as the gnome) Bonjour!
Bandit: I'll take one croissant please.
Bluey: No, no. You want all the croissants.
Bandit groans and shakes his head, looking away.
Bandit: I'll take all your croissants, please. How much?
Bingo: Sixty hundred.
Bandit: Okay, one sec.
Bandit starts to check his Bingo backpack, finding a banana. Bingo giggles as she gave Bandit the banana.
Bandit: Aha! Here you go!
Bandit realises what he pulled out.
Bandit: Huh?
Bluey and Bingo laugh at their dad's mistake.
Bandit: Uhh, do you take bananas?
Bingo: (as the gnome) Yes.
Bandit: You do? Oh, what luck!
Bandit happily puts the banana down on the table, then grabs akk of the pretend croissants he can. He takes one and pretends to eat it.
Bandit: Oh, so good!
We cut to a stand that has been decorated with an umbrella, an elephant plush, some cushions and a gnome wearing sunglasses.
Chilli: Namaste, mate.
Muffin: (as the gnome) Hello.
Chilli: How much for you to take us to this hotel?
Muffin: (as the gnome) Three hundred.
Chilli: No! The guidebook says one hundred. That's a good price.
Muffin: No no no, three hundred!
Bandit walks up to Chilli with his backpacks still on.
Bandit: Ready to roll?
Chilli: He wants three hundred!
Bandit: (whispering) Ask him if he takes bananas.
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Muffin: Bingo, give Uncle Bandit a tummy ache.
Bingo: Okay.
Bingo punches Bandit in the stomach. Bandit screams and drops his croissants.
Bandit: My stomach! I need the toilet.
Bluey and Bingo giggle quietly.
Bandit: Pay him whatever he wants!
Bandit wa;ls quickly towards the pretend car.
Bandit: I know how this ends!
Bandit and Chilli sit down in the pretend car. Bandit groans in pain.
Bandit: Croissants!
Chilli: Told you not to eat too many.
Chilli starts to read a book.
Bandit: But they were so cheap!
A bit later, Bandit and Chilli are listening to some music on a MP3 plater.
BanditL I hope it's not too far. 
Bingo: You want to stop and take a picture.
Chilli: Hang on, driver! I want to stop and take a picture. 
Chilli gets out of the car.
Bandit: Ahh, come on!
Chilli walks towards a pretend temple and looks at it amaazed.
Chilli: Ooh, look at that temple.
Bandit: Oh great, another temple photo.
Chilli starts to search around in her Socks backpack for something.
Chilli: Now, where's my camera?
Chilli finds it and pulls out... a potato masher?
Chilli: Ah, here it is. Oh.
Muffin and Socks laugh.
Bandit: Why did you bring a potato masher instead of a camera?
Chilli looks at the potato masher with an embarassed look.
Chilli: i don't really have a good explanation.
Later, Bandit and Chilli are on the road again with their backpacks. Chilli is reading in the guidebook as Bandit struggles to keep it together.
Chilli: This hotel we're going to looks lovely.
Bandit: Urgh, the toilet better work!
Bluey: Iwhispering to Chilli) This is where you get off.
Chilli: Ooh! This is where we get off.
Bandit and Chilli get out of the car.
Bandit: Finally. Thanks mate. 
Bandit looks around in his Bingo backpack for money and ends up pulling out a TV remote instead.
Bandit: Here's your money. 
Bandit realises what he pulled out.
Bandit: What?
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bluey: You're really thirsty.
Bandit: I'm really thirsty. I'll just get my water bottle, which is full of water.
Bandit searches around as Bluey empties out a bottle of water.
Bandit: Where's that water bottle? Ah, here it is.
Bandit tries to drink from it, only for him to realise that it's empty.
Bandit: Hey! It's empty!
Bluey and Bingo laugh again.
Bandit: How did that happen?
Cut to a street made up of stands with gnomes tending them. Bandit and Chilli walk through, politely declining any questions.
Chilli: No thanks. I'm fine. No thanks.
Muffin: You can't find the hotel.
Chilli: I can't find the hotel.
Bandit: I really need to get to a toilet. Just stay focused and don't get distracted.
Despite Bandit's instructions, Chilli stops at a stand.
Chilli: Yes, I would like to look at your beads.
Muffin giggkes.
Bandit: Sacre bleu!
Bluey: Bingo, tummy ache!
Bingo delivers a gut punch to Bandit, causing him to groan.
Bandit: Mama mia!
Bandit walks up to a tree.
Bandit: I need to sit down against this tree. 
He puts his back on the tree, squishing Bluey a bit. She giggles and tries to get free. Bandit sighs in relief.
Bandit: That's better.
Chilli comes up to him, confusedly looking in the guide book. Muffin is pretending to be some flies to bug Chilli.
Chilli: Get these flies away! I think we're lost!
Bandit: Oh, what?
Bandit presses his back on the tree again, making Bluey laugh and squirm.
Bingo: You need the toilet right now!
Bingo gives Bandit another punch to the belly, making Bandit groan loud.
Bandit: Let's just stay there.
Bandit and Chilli walk up to a shed where two gnomes can be seen inside on a table.
Chilli: Are you sure?
Bandit: Positive.
Bandit enters the shed and groans from the pain.
Bandit: Buon giorno? Come sta? I'd like a room where the toilet's inside that room.
Bluey: (as the gnome) Passports.
Bandit: You need our passports? Hang on, they're in my backpack.
Bandit starts checking through his Bingo backpack for his passports. Chilli starts searching through her Socks backpack for them as well. Bingo giggles and gives Bandit another tummy punch, making Bandit scream in pain while accidentally shaking the table. This causes the blue cap gnome to fall off and shatter on the ground. 
Bandit: Sorry mate!
Bingo: (as the gnome) Jeremy, no!
Bandit: I ate too many croissants.
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Chilli: I can't find the passports!
Bandit: Oh, wunderbar!
Chilli turns around, showing her Muffin backpack.
Chilli: Can you check my backpack?
Bandit starts to go through the Muffin backpack, causing her to giggle.
Muffin: Bluey, are these passports?
She pulls out two passports.
Bluey: Yeah, they're little books with your picture in them. They're the most important thing when you're backpacking, so we can't ever let them find them.
Bingo: Yeah, ever.
Muffin: Okay, Bluey.
Muffin hands Bingo the passports.
Muffin: Got that, Socks?
Socks: Ruff!
Bandit keeps searching through the Muffin backpack, making her giggle.
Bandit: Where are those passports? I'll check my front pack.
Bandit starts searching through Bingo, making her giggle.
Bandit: They must be here somewhere.
Bluey: Give them here, Bingo!
Bingo hands Bluey the passports. Bandit turns around and motions to his backpack.
Bandit: Check my backpack.
Chilli starts checking the Bluey backpack, causing her to giggle. Bluey hands Socks the passports, who takes it with a bark. Bluey hands Chilli a toilet brush.
Chilli: Why'd you bring the toilet brush?
All of the kids laugh loud, then Socks barks.
Bandit: That's it. Empty the backpacks!
Cut to the backyard. Bandit is holding Bingo upside down, shaking her to make her let go of the stuff she's holding. Bluey is on Bandit's back, laughing while watching. Chilli is currently doing the same to Socks as Muffin watches on Chilli's back.
Bandit: No passports here.
Bandit dumps Bingo on the floor and starts to empty Bluey. The dog riding the ox sculpture falls to the floor.
Bandit: Hey! Come on, lucky souvenir thing!
Bandit picks up the statue and looks at it hopefully.
Bandit: Please let our passports be in here!
Chilli has now finished emptying Socks, who is watching on the sand. Chilli is emptying Muffin, who is making noises as she does. The passports finally fall to the floor.
Chilli and Bandit: Yeah!
The kids (sans Socks) laughs. Cut to the shed's table, Chilli slams the passports onto it.
Chilli: Passports.
Bandit holds up the statue.
Bandit: Looks like this thing worked.
Chilli: Now who's the ding-dong?
Cut to later in Bandit and Chilli's bedroom where Chilli is shown looking out the window while smiling, The sound of a toilet flushing can be heard. Bandit walks in and stands right next to Chilli.
Chilli: Feeling better?
Bandit: Incroyable!
Bandit stretches.
Bandit: It's good not having those backpacks on. 
Bandit puts his arm around Chilli as they admire the view out their window.
Bandit: This place is alright.
Chilli: Yeah. And it's not even in the guidebook.
Bandit takes the guidebook and tosses it out the window.
Chilli: Hey!
Chilli chuckles and pause when they hear a voice.
Bluey: It's time for your mountain hike.
Bandit: It's time for our mountain hike. You ready?
Chilli: Sure am.
Bandit: Let's go!
Bandit and Chilli are now struggling to walk since the kids are now latched onto their legs. Bluey and Bingo cling onto Bandit's, while Muffin and Socks cling onto Chilli's. The kids laugh as the parents truggle to walk.
Bandit: These new hiking boots are good aren't thry?
Chilli: Yep, so light I can hardly feel them!
We cut to the credits, with Bluey dancing.
