The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler house. Cut to a shot from under Bluey's pillow. She lifts the pillow.
Bluey: She came!
Cut to the kitchen. Bandit is reading the paper and eating cereal; Chilli is making tea. Bluey runs in, waving a $5 bill.
Bluey: The Tooth Fairy came!
Bluey begins to floss. Chilli attempts to join in but doesn't quite have the hang of it.
Chilli: Hey, nice one Bluey!
Bandit: Way to go, kid.
Bluey stops dancing and waves the bill around.
Bluey: She left me five bucks!
Bandit spits out his cereal.
Bandit: Five bucks?!
Bluey: Yeah, I know. Five bucks!
Bandit: (to Chilli) Five bucks?
Chilli: (to Bandit) That's what she left all Bluey's friends.
Bandit: Well, that Tooth Fairy's doing well for herself, isn't she?
Chilli: Hey, maybe you can spend it at the markets today.
Bluey: Yeah!
Bluey starts flossing again.

Bingo: Hey, no I didn't! I'm coming too!
Bluey: Check this out, Bingo! The Tooth Fairy put a special sticker on here.
Bingo: Wow.
Bandit: What are you gonna spend it on, that's the question.
Bluey: Hmmm, that is a question.
Bingo: Hmm, question.
Cut to the markets. We see a number of stands selling food and crafts, with customers walking around. Cut to Indy's Mum's stall. It's decorated with Tibetan prayer flags. She's arranging baked goods, with a "no wheat" sign suggesting they are gluten free. Indy reaches up and dings a windchime. Bingo, Bluey, and Bandit approach.
Indy: Bluey!
Bluey: Indy!
Indy runs out to meet Bluey. They hug and laugh.
Bluey: Look, Indy. The Tooth Fairy gave me five bucks!
Indy: Wow! What are you gonna spend it on?
Bluey: I don't know. Can you come and help me?
Indy: Yeah! Mum, can I go and help Bluey?
Indy's Mum: Sure thing, Indy.
Bandit: I'll keep an eye on 'em.
Indy: Follow me!
Indy and Bluey run off. Bandit and Bingo follow at a walk. Cut to a stand selling bubble wands. The owner blows some large bubbles with a large bubble wand. Bluey runs in, with Indy riding piggyback.
Indy: Giant bubbles!
Bluey: Wooow!
The two run around popping bubbles for a moment.
Indy: Do you want to get one?
Bluey: Yeah, I do. Wait!
Cut to another booth. This one has two ponies - one with rainbow dyed hair and legwarmers, the other with teal hair and star anklets.
Indy: Pony ride!
Bluey: Excuse me. (pointing at teal pony) What's that pony's name?
Pony Lady: Her name's Biscuits
Bluey and Indy: Awww!
Bluey: (pointing at rainbow pony) And what's that one's name?
Pony Lady: Buttermilk.
Bluey and Indy: Awww!
Indy: (whispering) I really, really want to ride buttermilk.
Bluey: Definitely Buttermilk.
Bluey offers her money to the Pony Lady, who puts it in her pouch.
Bluey: Can we ride Buttermilk, please?
Pony Lady: Okay honey. Up you get.
Pony Lady picks Bluey up and sets her on Buttermilk's saddle.
Bluey: Okay, Indy, you can sit in front.
Pony Lady: Oh, I'm sorry, honey, you don't have enough money for two riders.
Bluey: Oh. I only want to go if Indy can come.
Indy: It's okay Bluey. I'll wait here.
Bluey: Hmm. I think I've changed my mind.
The Pony Lady lifts Bluey back down and gives her money back.
Pony Lady: Well, aren't you a good friend?
Bluey: Yes, Pony Lady.
Bluey walks up to Buttermilk and pets her nose.
Bluey: Goodbye, Buttermilk. You're so beautiful.
--This next bit was cut from Disney-distributed versions--
Buttermilk lifts her tail and poops. A lot. Bluey and Indy run away screaming. Cut to another street at the market, Bluey and Indy enter, still screaming. They stop to laugh and catch their breath.
Indy: (enthusiastically) That was disgusting!
Bluey: Yeah!
Bandit and Bingo (chanting offscreen) German sausage! German sausage!
--End of cut segment--
Bluey and Indy join Bandit and Bingo, who are in line at the German Sausage stand.
Bandit, Bingo, Bluey, and Indy: (chanting) German Sausage! German Sausage!
Bluey and Indy run over to the condiments table.
Bluey: Okay, I want a German sausage, and the squirty sauce, but only on one end, so you can have the other end.
Indy: But I'm not allowed that.
Bluey: Why not?
Indy: Mum says it's got added ingredients...?
Bluey: Can you have barbecue sauce?
Indy: I'm not allowed that one either.
Bluey: Mustard?
Indy: I'm definitely not allowed mustard.
Bluey: Well, what are we gonna get then?
Poffertje Dog: (offscreen) Poffertjes! Poffertjes!
Bluey: Indy!
Cut to the poffertje stand. The owner is holding a plate of poffertjes and as the girls run up, he offers it to them.
Poffertje Dog: Poffertjes?
Indy and Bluey smell the poffertjes.
Indy: Have these got any wheat, sugar, gluten, or dairy in them?
Poffertje Dog: That's all they've got in them.
Bluey and Indy: Ohhh.
Bluey: My friend can't eat them.
Bluey and Indy walk away sadly.
Poffertje Dog: Bye, girls. Poffertjes! 
Bluey: I just don't know what to get.
Winton's Dad enters with a single toffee apple on a tray.
Winton's Dad: Anyone want the last toffee apple? I've got one toffee apple left.
Bluey looks anxiously at the toffee apple.
Bluey: Oh, oh. I will!
Winton's Dad: Lovely jubbly.
Bluey pays him, and takes the apple. As Winton's Dad walks off, Indy points at the apple.
Indy: I'm pretty sure that has sugar in it.
Cut to an outdoor seating area. He's got his guitar case open in front of him for tips. There are several tables where people are eating food, including Bandit and Bingo. Busker is on a little stage on the left side, playing an acoustic guitar. Bingo is messily eating her German sausage. Bandit is going to take a bite of his, but stops as Bluey and Indy approach.
Bandit: Ah, toffee apple. Old school.
Bluey: I'm not sure I like this toffee apple. Plus, Indy can't have any.
Bandit: Oh, that's no good.
Cut to Busker's stage. A clearly nervous Buddy approaches the case and gingerly puts five bucks in.
Busker: (shouting) Ah, thanks buddy!
Buddy runs away screaming.
Buddy: Aaaaaaah!
Busker: That deserves a song.
Cut back to Bluey contemplating her toffee apple.
Bluey: Dad, I'm not sure I made the right choice. I think I want to put my five bucks in that case and get a song.
Bandit: Oh, right.
Bluey: Can I get my five bucks back?
Bandit: That's not really how it works, kiddo. Once you've spent money, it's... well, gone.
Bluey: Oh. Okay.
Indy: Don't worry Bluey. My mum always says to me, "What goes around, comes around."
Bluey: (on the verge of crying) What does that mean?
Indy: I dunno.
Cut to the toffee apple stand. Winton's Dad takes out five bucks and hands it to Winton.
Winton's Dad: Sweetheart, can you go get your dad a German sausage please?
Winton: Okay, dad.
In a close up, we can see the sticker indicating this is Bluey's Tooth Fairy money. Cut back to Busker, beginning a new song.
Busker: Here we go!
Cut to Indy's Mom's stand. She begins to dance.
Indy's Mum: Now that's a tune.

Gruber's Dad: Gruber, go get me a carrot juice.
Gruber: Sure thing, Dad.
At Juniper's Mum's juice stand, Gruber spends the Tooth Fairy money on carrot juice.
Gruber: Carrot juice, please.
Juniper's Mum: Oh, we're out of carrots. Will you get me a bag of carrots please, Juniper?
Juniper's Mum gives Juniper the Tooth Fairy money.
Juniper: Yes, mum.
At a produce stand, Juniper buys a bag of carrots with the Tooth Fairy money.
Juniper: I'd like these carrots, please.
Honey's Mum buys a bag of mushrooms, and receives the Tooth Fairy money as change.
Honey's Mum: Just these, please.
Honey's Mum walks by Indy's Mum's stand. Indy's Mum is dancing enthusiastically. Honey's Mum buys a slice of cake with the Tooth Fairy money.
Honey's Mum: I'll have that one, thank you!
Indy's Mum: Indy?
Indy and Bluey run over.
Indy: Yes, mum?
Indy's Mum: Be a sweetie. Go and pop this in the guitar case for me.
Indy: Okay. Look Bluey!
Bluey: (gasps)
We get a close up of Bluey looking at the sticker. At Busker's stage, Bluey puts the money in the guitar case.
Busker: Whoa! Five bucks? Thanks matey! That deserves another song! Who likes to dance? Two, three, four!
Busker starts another song. Bluey and Indy begin flossing. Bingo, Bandit, and Buddy join in. Cut to Bandit, Bingo, and Bluey walking home through the meadow. Bingo is riding piggyback on Bandit. Bluey is carrying her toffee apple.
Bandit: ...and this little piggy went, "Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee" all the way home!
Bluey takes a bit of her apple. She loses a tooth, which sticks in the apple.
Bluey: Dad! I've lost another tooth!
