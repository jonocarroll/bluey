The episode starts at Calypso's school. The shot cuts to the main classroom, where all the children are gathered around by Calypso.
Calypso: "Okay class, something very special is happening today!"
Bluey, Mackenzie: "What is it?"
Bluey and Mackenzie look at each other after saying the same thing in unintentional unison. Winton scoots up next to Bluey.
Winton: "Oooh! Bluey's gonna marry Mackenzie!"
Bluey & Mackenzie: "No we're not!"
Calypso: "You're going to see your buddies!"
The children: "Hooray!"
Calypso: "Now, go to the special place where you meet them."
The children laugh as they all run off. The shot cuts to Bluey running to her buddy, sitting on a hill resting underneath a tree.
Bluey: "Mia!"
Mia: "Bluey!"
Mia and Bluey hug each other.
Bluey: "Can we build a fairy garden?"
Mia: "Okay, let's go!"
The shot cuts to Mackenzie meeting his buddy.
Mackenzie: "Captain!"
Captain: "Mackenzie!"
The two do a unique handshake.
Mackenzie: "Can we play barky boats?"
Captain: "Okay!"
EPISODE TITLE: Barky Boats
Calypso: "This episode of Bluey is called Barky Boats."
The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mia, who run down the hill, joyfully laughing.
Bluey: "Mia? Can I show you my cartwheel?"
Mia: "Go for it!"
Bluey proceeds to do a cartwheel, impressing Mia.
Mia: "Wow! You've been practicing! Watch mine!"
Mia does her cartwheel, landing in a split.
Bluey: "Whoa!"
Mia: "Come on! I'll race you!"
Bluey: "Okay!"
Bluey and Mia race after one another, heading to the forest where their fairy garden resides. The shot cuts to Mackenzie and Captain sitting by a small pond canal. Mackenzie grabs some wood bark chips scattered about the ground.
Captain: "I'll make the dam!"
Mackenzie: "Here's a good one!"
Captain: "Oh yeah, that'll go fast!"
Just then, Bluey and Mia run by as Mackenzie is busy sharpening a bark chip to refine the shape.
Captain: "Hi Mia. Hi Mia! HI MIA!"
Mia: "Oh! Hi Captain!"
Captain: "What are you up to?"
Mia: "Bluey and I are gonna go build a fairy garden. What are you doing?"
Captain: "We're playing barky boats!"
Mia: "Oh, okay. Have fun. Bye!"
Captain: "Bye, Mia!"
Bluey and Mackenzie stick their tongue out at each other, showing they have a light rivalry with one another. After Bluey and Mia leave, Mackenzie runs back with the barky boat.
Mackenzie: "Okay, let it go!"
Captain moves his hands away from the dam, causing the water to flood out as the barky boat travels down the canal.
Mackenzie & Captain: "Yeah! Look at it go!"
The boat reaches the end, a wave of new water overlapping with the pond at the end of the canal.
Mackenzie: "Again!"
Captain: "Hey, uhh, Mackenzie? Do you wanna help Bluey build a fairy garden?"
Mackenzie: "...No?"
Captain: "Ah, okay."
The shot cuts to Bluey and Mia in the forest, running to a secluded space with a small stream of water running through.
Bluey: "Let's build it here!"
Bluey grabs a log, and Mia grabs a couple leaves.
Bluey: "This can be the bridge."
Mia: "These can be the trees!"
Bluey and Mia do more work on the fairy garden, setting up houses out of the resources around the forest. Mia helps Bluey pick a couple plants off of the trees, and then the shot cuts to a more complete fairy garden.
Bluey: "How old are you?"
Mia: "Twelve!"
Bluey: "Wow. Can you drive a car?"
Mia: "Hehehe! No, not yet!"
Bluey: "When do you start big school?"
Mia: "Next year."
Bluey: "Are you nervous about big school?"
Mia's smile slightly drops into a worried frown.
Mia: "No, it's gonna be great!"
Bluey: "Ooh, can you write words?"
Mia: "Yeah!"
Bluey: "Can you write a letter to the fairies?"
Mia: "Okay, go for it!"
Bluey: "Okay, um. Dear fairies--"
Mackenzie and Captain enter, alerting Bluey and Mia.
Captain: "Hi!"
Bluey: "Aah! Ugh, Mackenzie, what are you doing here?"
Mackenzie: "He made me come!"
Mia: "Explain yourself!"
Captain: "Oh, I...I thought there might be some good bark here for our barky boats."
Bluey: "Well, there's not, now shoo!"
Mackenzie: "I told you! Come on, let's go!"
Mia: "Bye!"
Bluey: "Ugh, that was close! Okay, dear fairies: Dad bought new grass, but it had ants in it, and he couldn't find the ant powder, and Mum was like 'Where'd you last have it?' He said--"
Mia gets sidetracked and pulls up a piece of bark.
Mia: "Oh! Look! Do you think this would make a good barky boat?"
Bluey: "Uhhh, I guess?"
Mia: "Do you just wanna just quickly give it to Mackenzie?"
Bluey: "No!"
Mia: "Come on Bluey, I'll race you!"
Mia runs off, but Bluey hesitantly waits behind, worried she's leaving her behind to hang out with Captain and Mackenzie. The shot cuts back to the two other buddies, playing another round of barky boats.
Mackenzie: "Keep letting the water build up!"
Captain: "Okay."
Mackenzie: "And no running off!"
Captain: "Yeah, okay. I don't know what I was thinking."
Mia enters, alerting the two.
Mia: "Hi!"
Captain: "Aah!"
Captain jumps, scared by Mia's sudden appearance. causing the built-up water to flood out, splashing Mackenzie in the face.
Mackenzie: "Aah!"
Captain: "Sorry, Mackenzie!"
Bluey enters, looking annoyed.
Mackenzie: "What are you doing here?!"
Bluey: "She made me come.."
Mia: "I thought you might like this barky boat?"
Captain: "Aw, thanks! That's a good one!"
Mackenzie: "It's not that good.."
Bluey: "It's gooder than yours!"
Mackenzie: "Is not!"
Mia: "I can find a better one!"
Captain: "I'll help you."
Mia: "Okay!"
Mia & Captain: "We'll be right back!"
The two run off, leaving Bluey and Mackenzie alone.
Bluey & Mackenzie: "Awww..."
Some time passes, Bluey and Mackenzie sulk by the barky boats pond. Just then, Calypso enters!
Calypso: "Aw, Bluey! Mackenzie! Where are your buddies?"
Bluey: "They ran away from us!"
Calypso: "Oh, goodness me."
Bluey: "Don't they like us?"
Calypso: "Of course they do! But, it can be hard being twelve years old, sometimes."
Bluey: "What do you mean?"
Calypso: "Here, give me those barky boats. I'll show you something. Go on, hold the water back."
Bluey and Mackenzie both hold the water back, causing it to build up.
Calypso: "There once were two six year-old buddies floating around, nice and calm, not a care in the world! They turned seven years old, then eight years old, then nine, then ten, and eleven, and then...!"
Mackenzie: "I can't hold it any longer!"
Bluey: "Look out!"
The two let go of the dam, causing the water to flood out at high speeds and for the two barky boats to go travelling down.
Calypso: "Twelve! Off they went, on a big adventure! Hang on, buddies!"
Bluey & Mackenzie:' "Yeah, hang on, buddies!"
Calypso: "They went this way, and that way..."
The boats begin to drift due to the surging rush of water, with them coming close to falling out.
Mackenzie: "Aah! Are they gonna make it?"
Bluey: "I don't know!"
The barky boats continue down the canal, before finally landing in the pond at the end of the path safely.
Bluey & Mackenzie: "Yeah! They made it!"
Calypso: "Hooray!"
Bluey: "And they lived happily ever after."
Calypso: "Just be patient, children. Your buddies haven't forgotten you."
Bluey & Mackenzie: "Okay, Calypso!"
Now back with Captain and Mia, they walk into a empty part of the forest, with a fruit tree.
Mia: "Maybe there's some barky boats around here."
Captain: "Yeah, there usually is."
Mia: "Ooh! Lillie-pillies! Let's pick some for our buddies!"
Captain: "Okay!"
The two pick some lillie-pillies.
Captain: "What's your favorite fruit?"
Mia: "Uhh, lychees! What's yours?"
Captain: "I like mangoes."
The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mackenzie. Now with Calypso gone they're back to waiting for their buddies to return.
Mackenzie: "Are you going to go back to your fairy garden?"
Bluey: "Uh, no. It's not as much fun without my buddy."
Mackenzie: "Yeah, same...Wanna play barky boats with me?"
Bluey: "Ooh, okay!"
Mackenzie: "We can race our buddies!"
Bluey and Mackenzie ready their barky boats.
Bluey: "Ready? One, two, three, go!"
Mackenzie: "Wooo!"
Bluey: "Go, Mia!"
The shot cuts to Mia and Captain, now lying on the forest floor, resting under the sun.
Mia: "Are you nervous about starting high school?"
Captain: "A little."
Mia: "Me too...at least we'll be there together!"
As the two smile and their tails wag, the shouts of their buddies can be heard in the distance.
Captain & Mia: "Our buddies!"
Bluey: "Noo, Mia won!"
Mackenzie: "No she didn't, Captain won!"
Bluey: "No he didn't!"
Mackenzie: "Yes, he did!"
The two blow raspberries at each other. Soon after they burst into laughter with one another. Mia and Captain run back.
Captain: "We're back!"
Bluey & Mackenzie: "Hooray!"
Mia: "We're so sorry, Bluey! I don't know what happened..."
Captain: "We were looking for barky boats..."
Mia: "And went down this way, and that way and--"
Captain: "And we found some lillie-pillies, and then I...I don't know what happened!"
Bluey: "That's okay! You made it back!"
Bluey hugs Mia, and Mackenzie does a fist-bump with Captain.
Mia: "Come on Bluey, let's finish the fairy letter!"
Bluey: "Okay!"
Before Bluey goes to hop on Mia's back, ready to leave for the fairy garden again, she stops and looks over to Mackenzie and Captain. She runs over to hug Mackenzie.
Bluey: "See 'ya, Mackenzie!"
Mackenzie: "See 'ya, Bluey!"
The Pups: "Bye!" 
Bluey and Mia leave. Meanwhile, Mackenzie and Captain run back to the barky boats pond.
Captain: "Alright, come on! Let's do the biggest dam ever!"
Mackenzie: "Yeah!"
The shot cuts back to Bluey and Mia. The fairy garden is complete, and Mia is ready to continue with Bluey's letter to the fairies.
Mia: "Okay, ready Bluey!"
Bluey: "Dear fairies: Dad bought new grass. It had ants! I love my buddy Mia, cause she can do the splits, and she gives me piggybacks."
Mia: "Oh, I love giving you piggybacks!"
Bluey: "Please get the ants out of Dad's grass, and also look after Mia when she goes to big school, even though she isn't scared."
Mia stops writing, and begins tearing up at Bluey's words and the feeling that she is heading off to high school soon.
Bluey: "And make sure she doesn't forget to come and play with me. Kiss kiss kiss, hug hug h-"
Mia hugs Bluey, with Bluey smiling in return.
