Bluey: Ooh, can you write words?
Mia: Yeah.
Bluey: Can you write a message to the fairies?
Mia: Yeah, sure.
Mia: Okay, Go for it.
Bluey: Um, “Dear Fairies…”
Capitan: Hi.
Bluey: Aah! Ugh, Mackenzie, what are you doing here?
Mackenzie: He made me come.
Mia: Explain yourself.
Capitan: Oh, I…
Capitan: I thought there might be some good bark here for our barky boats.
Bluey: Well, there’s not.
Bluey: Now shosh-shosh-shosh-shosh-shosh.
Mackenzie: I told you.
Mackenzie: Come on. Let’s go.
Mia: Bye.
Bluey: Oh, that was close.
Bluey: Okay, “Dear Fairies, Dad bought new grass, but it had ants in it and he couldn’t find the ant powder and Mum was like, ‘Where’d you last have it’ and he said…”
Mia: Oh, look. Do you think this would make a good barky boat?
Bluey: Um, I guess.
Mia: Do you want to just quickly give it to Mackenzie?
Bluey: No.
Mia: Come on, Bluey, I’ll race you.
Mackenzie: Keep letting the water build up.
Capitan: Okay.
Mackenzie: And no running off.
Capitan: Yeah, okay. I don’t know what I was thinking.
Mia: Hi.
Capitan: Aah!
Mackenzie: Aah!
Capitan: Sorry, Mackenzie.
Mackenzie: What are you doing here?
Bluey: She made me come.
Mia: I thought you might like this barky boat.
Capitan: Aw, thanks, that’s a good one.
Mackenzie: It’s not that good.
Bluey: It’s gooder than yours.
Mackenzie: Is not.
Mia: I can find a better one.
Capitan: I’ll help you.
Mia: Okay.
Capitan: We won’t be long, Mackenzie.
Mia: I’ll be right back, Bluey.
Bluey and Mackenzie: Hey.
Bluey and Mackenzie: Aw.
Calypso: Aw, Bluey, Mackenzie, where are your buddies:
Bluey: They ran away from us.
Calypso: Oh, goodness me.
Bluey: Don’t they like us?
Calypso: Of course they do. But it can be hard being twelve years old sometimes.
Bluey: What do you mean?
Calypso: Here, give me those barky boats. I’ll show you something.
Calypso: Go on, hold the water back.
Calypso: There once were two six-year-old buddies floating around, nice and calm, not a care in the world. They turn 7 years old, then 8 years old, then 9, then 10, then 11, then…
Mackenzie: I can’t hold it any longer.
Bluey: Look out!
Calypso: 12! Whoo!
Calypso: Off they went, on a big adventure.
Bluey and Mackenzie: Whoa!
Calypso: Hang on, buddies.
Bluey and Mackenzie: Yeah, hang on buddies!
Calypso: They went this way and that way.
Mackenzie: Aah! Are they gonna make it?
Bluey: I don’t know.
Bluey and Mackenzie: Yay, they made it!
Calypso: Hooray!
Bluey: And they lived happily ever after.
Calypso: Just be patient, children. Your buddies haven’t forgotten you.
Bluey and Mackenzie: Okay, Calypso.
Mia: Maybe there’s some bark here.
Capitan: Yeah, there usually is.
Mia: Ooh, lilli-pillies. Let’s pick some for our buddies.
Capitan: Okay. What’s your favorite fruit?
Mia: Uh, lychees. What’s yours?
Capitan: I like mangoes.
Mackenzie: Are you going to go back to your fairy garden?
Bluey: Um, no. It’s not as fun without my buddy.
Mackenzie: Yeah, same.
Mackenzie: Do you want to play barky boats with me?
Bluey: Ooh, okay.
Mackenzie: We can race our buddies.
Bluey: Ready? One, two three, go!
Mackenzie: Whoo!
Bluey: Go, Mia.
Mia: Are you nervous about starting high school?
Capitan: A little.
Mia: Me too.
Mia: At least we’ll be there together.
Bluey: Go Mia!
Mackenzie: Go Capitan!
Mia and Capitan: Huh? Our buddies!
Bluey: No, Mia won.
Mackenzie: No, she didn’t. Capitan won.
Bluey: No, he didn’t.
Mackenzie: Yes, he did.
Bluey and Mackenzie: Pbht!
Capitan: We’re back.
Bluey and Mackenzie: Hooray!
Mia: I’m so sorry, Bluey. I don’t know what happened.
Capitan: We were looking for barky boats…
Mia: We went down this way and that way…
Capitan: And we found some lilli-pillies and then I don’t know what happened.
Bluey: That’s okay. You made it back.
Mackenzie and Capitan: Huh!
Mia: Come on, Bluey, let’s finish the fairy letter.
Bluey: Okay.
Bluey: See ya, Mackenzie.
Mackenzie: See ya, Bluey.
All: Bye.
Capitan: Alright. Come on. Let’s do the biggest dam ever.
Mackenzie: Yeah!
Mia: Okay, ready, Bluey.
Bluey: “Dear Fairies, Dad bought new grass. It had ants. I love my buddy Mia ‘cause she can do the splits and she gives me piggybacks.”
Mia: Oh, I love giving you piggybacks.
Bluey: “Please get the ants out of Dad’s grass, and also, look after Mia when she goes to big school, even though she isn’t scared and make sure she doesn’t forget to come and play with me. Kiss, kiss, kiss, hug hug, hug”
