Bluey and Snickers: What's the time, Mrs. Wolf?
Coco: 7 o'clock!
Bluey and Snickers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7! What's the time Mrs. Wolf?
Coco: 10 o'clock!
Bluey: Coco!
Bluey and Snickers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!
Bluey: What's the time, Mrs. Wolf?
Coco: Dinner time! Got you!
Snickers: Coco!
Bluey: You always do this!
Coco: Do what?
Bluey: Something to make the game easy for you.
Coco: Do I?
Bluey: Yes.
Coco: Oh, sorry Bluey. I'll try and stop.
Snickers: What if we play Shadowlands instead?
Bluey: Yeah!
(VO: This episode of Bluey is called: Shadowlands.)
Coco: What’s Shadowlands?
Snickers: It’s fun.
Bluey: All the shadowy, grassy bits are the land, and all the bits in the sun is the sea.
Snickers: Yeah, and there’s crocodiles in the sea.
Bluey: Yeah, you can’t touch the water, or you get bitten by a crocodile.
Coco: So you can only walk on the land? These bits?
Bluey: Yeah, and we have to get from here to the picnic blanket.
Coco: Alright!
Bluey: But you can’t just change the rules to make it easy this time, okay?
Coco: No, I won’t.
Bluey: You promise?
Coco: I promise.
Snickers: Okay, let’s go!
Bluey: Yeah!
Coco: This is fun!
Snickers: I told you!
Bluey: You won’t get us, crocodile.
Snickers: Oh, I can’t jump that far. Look at my little legs.
Coco: Well, maybe just this time you can have crocodile-proof shoes.
Bluey: Coco!
Coco: Oh yeah. Sorry. But how is Snickers gonna get over?
Bluey: Um… I know! Come here, Coco!
Bluey: No get on my shoulders.
Bluey and Coco: Go, Snickers! Yeah, we did it!
Coco: Great idea, Bluey!
Bluey: Hey, this bug looks like bird poo!
Snickers: Bluey, look out! Bluey! Bluey!
Coco: You’re trapped!
Snickers: How are you gonna get across the river?
Bluey: I don’t know.
Coco: How about we just pretend in this bit, all the crocodiles are asleep?
Bluey: You can’t change the rules, Coco!
Coco: Aww, why not?
Bluey: Because they’re the rules!
Snickers: Look, a bus! Are you ready, Bluey?
Bluey: I’m ready!
Coco and Snickers: Go! Go, Bluey!
Bluey, Coco, and Snickers: Yeah!
Coco: That was so cool!
Snickers: Come on! We’re almost at the picnic blanket!
Bluey: Be careful, everyone. This bridge is really skinny! Wait! It’s getting windy!
Coco: The wind’s making it move! I can’t stay on!
Bluey: 
Snickers: The crocodiles are gonna get us!
Coco: What are we gonna do?
Bluey: Run! Phew. We made it!
Coco: But look! There’s no way to get across the sea!
Snickers: And we can’t go back this way!
Bluey: We’re trapped on a palm tree island! Oh noooooo!
Chilli: The little critters must be hungry.
Bella: Oh, I brought something for them.
Chilli: Cupcakes! Who wants cupcakes?
Bluey, Coco, Snickers: Cupcakes!
Coco: They’ve got blue icing! And sprinkles!
Snickers: Sprinkles!
Coco: Why don’t we just make it so we can… walk on water?
Bluey: No one can walk on water.
Snickers: Water boatmen can.
Bluey: Well, we aren’t water boatmen. We need to find another way.
Chilli: I’m going to eat your cupcakes!
Bluey, Coco, and Snickers: No!
Coco: That’s it! I’m gonna be a water boatman and walk across this water—and have a cupcake!
Bluey and Snickers: No, Coco!
Coco: But I want a cupcake!
Bluey: You can’t just change the rules!
Coco: But you still haven’t told me why!
Bluey: Well, because… I don’t know!
Coco: See, there’s no reason.
Snickers: Maybe Coco’s right, Bluey. Maybe we can just change the rules an eensy bit? It’ll still be Shadowlands.
Bluey: Okay.
Bluey: Walt!
Coco: What is it?
Bluey: The wind is back!
Coco: Look! It’s blowing the cloud!
Snickers: It’s heading towards the sun!
Bluey: Run! Quick!
Bluey and Coco: Hurry up, Snickers!
Bluey: Run your little sausage dog legs!
Snickers: I can’t run any faster! Oof!
Bluey: Run!
Coco: The crocodiles are coming! We did it!
Snickers: That was so much fun!
Bluey: Yeah!
Coco: That’s why you can’t change the rules—because the rules make it fun!
Bluey: Oh yeah!
Chilli: Kids and cupcakes, eh?
Chilli: A cupcake for each hand, Snickers? You got it made in the shade!
Bluey, Bella, Chilli, Snickers, and Snickers’ Mum: What’s the time, Mrs. Wolf?
Coco: 3 o’clock!
Bluey, Bella, Chilli, Snickers, and Snickers’ Mum: 1, 2, 3! What’s the time, Mrs. Wolf?
Coco: Um…
Chilli: Maybe this one will be dinnertime!
Bluey: It won’t. Coco always waits until we’re right up next to her before she says—
Coco: Dinner time!
