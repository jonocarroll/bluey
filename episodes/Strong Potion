The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heelers' house in daytime. Cut to the hallway outside Bandit and Chilli's bedroom. Bluey sits behind a potion stand, made from an overturned cardboard box with a drawing of a potion on it. Bingo walks in, and Bluey waves to her.
Bluey: "Hello, this is a potion shop."
Bingo stops and faces Bluey.
Bluey: "Can I interest you in a potion?"
Bingo: "No thanks, I just want to go into Mum and Dad's room.
Bluey: "Okay. Goodbye."
Bingo: "Bye."
Bingo walks away.
Cut Bandit and Chilli's room. Bandit is making the bed. Bingo enters. Bandit spots her and turns around. He points sternly.
Bandit: "Hey, you! Out. This is private property."
Bandit holds out his hand at just above his shoulder level.
Bandit: "You have to be at least this tall to enter."
Bingo jumps up and down, trying to reach the level of his arm.
Bingo: "Uh! Eh! Eeh!"
Bingo stops jumping and giggles.
Bandit: "Out."
Bandit pushes Bingo gently out the door as she continues giggling. Bandit dusts his hands and walks away.
Cut back to the hallway.
Bluey: "Oh, hello! You're back. Maybe you'd like to buy a potion now?"
Bingo: "Yes, please!"
Bluey pretends to retrieve a potion from behind the box, and holds it up.
Bluey: "Can I interest you in a strong potion?"
Bingo: "Yes."
Cut back to Bandit and Chilli's bedroom, where Bandit is once again making the bed. Bingo saunters in."
Bandit: "Hey, what're you doing back here?! I told you this is private property. Get out!"
Bingo: "Nope."
Bandit: "What?! That. Is. It!"
Bandit stomps angrily towards Bingo. Bingo pretends to drink a potion.
Bingo: (swallowing) "Dug-dig-dig-dig-dig!"
As Bandit reaches Bingo, she grabs him by the hand and twists, easily bringing him to his knees.
Bandit: (whimpering in pain) "Ugh! A-ah!"
Bingo grunts and shoves Bandit's captive hand. Bandit throws himself onto the bed.
Bandit: "Ugh! What's going on? How'd you get so strong?"
Bingo climbs up on the bed and throws Bandit back the other way. Bandit leaps off the bed, runs across the room, and runs into the doorframe, falling to the floor.
Bandit: "Oof! Ugh!"
Cut to the verandah outside Bandit and Chilli's bedroom. Bandit flies into frame and lands face down on the decking.
Bandit: "Ow!"
Cut to the master bathroom. Bandit leaps in through the door, landing on his back.
Bandit: "Ooh!"
Cut to the hallway just outside the master bedroom.
Bingo: (offscreen) "Yah!"
Bandit flies through the doorway, landing on the floor.
Bandit: "—aah! Ooh!"
The camera pulls back, bringing Bluey's potion shop into frame.
Bluey: "Can I interest you in a potion?"
