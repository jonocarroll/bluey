 BINGO: Bluey, do you want to play 'Ground's Lava'? 
 BLUEY: Ooh, where you can't touch the ground?
BINGO: Yeah! 
BLUEY: Okay, I'll just put my plate back in the kitchen. 
 
 CHILLI: I see what you're saying, I just don't agree.
 BANDIT: How can you not agree? 
BLUEY: Are you two squabbling?
CHILLI: One second, Bluey. 
BANDIT: If you attach the bin to the door, it means I have to deal with the bin bags. 
CHILLI: Yeah, but you don't have to touch the bin. 
 
BANDIT: But I like taking the whole bin out, bin bags are a pain.
CHILLI: You're a pain.
BANDIT: Oh, great. 
 
BLUEY: Stop squabbling, I don't like it. 
BANDIT: We're not squabbling, kiddo. We're just talking. 
CHILLI: Sorry, Bluey. It's okay. 
 
CHILLI: Look, let's talk about this later. 
BANDIT: Can't wait. 
 
BLUEY: This episode of Bluey is called 'Postman.'
BLUEY: This is your letterbox. 
BLUEY: And this is your letterbox, here's some letter writing things, and I'm the postie. 
BANDIT: Oh, great.
BANDIT: What? 
BLUEY: You have to write a letter. 
BANDIT: Oh, okay. Who should I write it to? 
 
BLUEY: The only other person with a letterbox is Mum.
BANDIT: Well, I better write one to Mum then.
 
BLUEY: Yes, write that you're not enemies.
BANDIT: But we're not enemies! 
BLUEY: Yes, yes. Put it in the letter. 
BANDIT: We were just having a discussion. 
BLUEY: It was a squabble. 
BANDIT: Maybe, but we still love each other.
BLUEY: People shouldn't squabble. 
BANDIT: You're probably right. It's good to get to the bottom of things, though. 
BLUEY: Well, I'm not going to squabble with anyone. 
BANDIT: Fair enough. 
 
BANDIT: Here you go. 
BLUEY: Thank you! 
 
BANDIT: Hey! You're reading my mail?! 
 
BLUEY: Ooh, a love heart! 
 
BLUEY: See you! 
 
BINGO: Ah! Bluey, stop! You're in the lava! 
BLUEY: Huh? 
BINGO: We're playing 'Ground's Lava', remember? 
BLUEY: Oh, yeah. But I can't anymore, Bingo. I'm playing 'Postman'. 
BINGO: Awh, you always say you'll play with me, and you never do.
BLUEY: No, I don't. 
BINGO: Yes, you don't. 
BLUEY: No, I don't. Wait, -this is squabbling! Uhm, okay, we can play both, Bingo.
BINGO: Yay! Thanks, Bluey! 
 
BLUEY: Hm, not squabbling is easy! 
 
BLUEY: This episode of Bluey is called 'Postman and Ground's Lava'. 
BLUEY: We need to get to the top deck, so I can deliver this letter to Mum.
 
BINGO: Okay, but we have to do it without touching the lava.
BLUEY: Help me with the bike.
BINGO: It's too heavy! Can we just leave it here? 
 
BLUEY: You can't be a postie without a motorbike. 
 
BINGO: Yeah you can, postie Petunia doesn't have a motorbike.
BLUEY: But she's not real.
BINGO: Yeah she is, she's on TV.
BLUEY: No she's- Wait. Is this a squabble? 
BINGO: Uhm, yes. 
BLUEY: Well, we have to stop it 'cause I'm never squabbling again!
