Bingo: Bluey, do you want to play 'Ground's Lava'? 
Bluey: Ooh, where you can't touch the ground?
Bingo: Yeah! 
Bluey: Okay, I'll just put my plate back in the kitchen. 
 
Chilli: I see what you're saying, I just don't agree.
Bandit: How can you not agree? 
Bluey: Are you two squabbling?
Chilli: One second, Bluey. 
Bandit: If you attach the bin to the door, it means I have to deal with the bin bags. 
Chilli: Yeah, but you don't have to touch the bin. 
 
Bandit: But I like taking the whole bin out, bin bags are a pain.
Chilli: You're a pain.
Bandit: Oh, great. 
 
Bluey: Stop squabbling, I don't like it. 
Bandit: We're not squabbling, kiddo. We're just talking. 
Chilli: Sorry, Bluey. It's okay. 
 
Chilli: Look, let's talk about this later. 
Bandit: Can't wait. 
 
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called 'Postman.'
Bluey: This is your letterbox. 
Bluey: And this is your letterbox, here's some letter writing things, and I'm the postie. 
Bandit: Oh, great.
Bandit: What? 
Bluey: You have to write a letter. 
Bandit: Oh, okay. Who should I write it to? 
 
Bluey: The only other person with a letterbox is Mum.
Bandit: Well, I better write one to Mum then.
 
Bluey: Yes, write that you're not enemies.
Bandit: But we're not enemies! 
Bluey: Yes, yes. Put it in the letter. 
Bandit: We were just having a discussion. 
Bluey: It was a squabble. 
Bandit: Maybe, but we still love each other.
Bluey: People shouldn't squabble. 
Bandit: You're probably right. It's good to get to the bottom of things, though. 
Bluey: Well, I'm not going to squabble with anyone. 
Bandit: Fair enough. 
 
Bandit: Here you go. 
Bluey: Thank you! 
 
Bandit: Hey! You're reading my mail?! 
 
Bluey: Ooh, a love heart! 
 
Bluey: See you! 
 
Bingo: Ah! Bluey, stop! You're in the lava! 
Bluey: Huh? 
Bingo: We're playing 'Ground's Lava', remember? 
Bluey: Oh, yeah. But I can't anymore, Bingo. I'm playing 'Postman'. 
Bingo: Awh, you always say you'll play with me, and you never do.
Bluey: No, I don't. 
Bingo: Yes, you don't. 
Bluey: No, I don't. Wait, -this is squabbling! Uhm, okay, we can play both, Bingo.
Bingo: Yay! Thanks, Bluey! 
 
Bluey: Hm, not squabbling is easy! 
 
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called 'Postman and Ground's Lava'. 
Bluey: We need to get to the top deck, so I can deliver this letter to Mum.
 
Bingo: Okay, but we have to do it without touching the lava.
Bluey: Help me with the bike.
Bingo: It's too heavy! Can we just leave it here? 
 
Bluey: You can't be a postie without a motorbike. 
 
Bingo: Yeah you can, postie Petunia doesn't have a motorbike.
Bluey: But she's not real.
Bingo: Yeah she is, she's on TV.
Bluey: No she's- Wait. Is this a squabble? 
Bingo: Uhm, yes. 
Bluey: Well, we have to stop it 'cause I'm never squabbling again!
Bingo: Oh, okay.
Bluey: So you'll just have to agree with me on everything, okay?
Bingo: Okay, easy.
Bluey: Now, grab the bike.
Bingo: Yes, because posties have motorbikes.
Bluey: I think I can reach the bottom step!
Bingo: But they're lava!
Bluey: What?! The steps are lava too?!
Bingo: Yeah, it's a lava waterfall.
Bluey: But Mum's upstairs. I'm making it so the steps aren't lava.
Bingo: Aw, not fair.
Bluey: You have to agree with me on everything, remember?
Bingo: I think you should agree with me on everything.
Bluey: I don't agree on that.
Bingo: Well, I do.
Bluey: Well, I don't.
Bingo: Ah-ah, we're squabbling.
Bluey: Oh, yeah, okay, I'll agree with you on everything.
Bingo: Splendid, the steps are lava.
Bluey: How are we gonna get up them?
Bingo: Steppie stones!
Bluey: Oh, that's it! Wee, this is fun.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Bluey: Ooh, good thing we left all our stuff on the floor.
Bluey: Okay, let's go this way to the kitchen.
Bingo: No, let's go over the couches.
Bluey: But that's the long way.
Bingo: So?
Bluey: There's no time! I have to get this letter to Mum now!
Bingo: But the couch way's more fun, and you have to agree with me, remember?
Bluey: Well, I think let's try where I agree with me, and you agree with you.
Bingo: Mm, okay.
Bluey: See you at the kitchen!
Bluey: Oh, no! I'm stuck!
Bingo: Me too.
Bluey: Look, a lava boat!
Bingo: But how are we gonna get to it?
Bluey: I know!
Bingo: Go, Bluey!
Bluey: We made it.
Bingo: I guess posties do need bikes.
Bluey: Maybe we should just agree with each other on everything.
Bingo: Okay.
Bluey: Oh, Bingo, this is the only way to travel on lava. Wouldn't you agree?
Bingo: Yes, I would agree. Almost there.
Bluey: Oh! We can't get over the thing!
Bingo: Don't worry!
Bluey: Mail's here.
Bluey: Hey, what, where's Mum?
Bingo: There she is.
Bingo: She must have moved.
Bluey: Aww! We took too long! Now she'll never get my letter.
Bingo: Why do you want to deliver this letter so much?
Bluey: Cause if I don't, Mum and Dad will be enemies forever.
Bingo: What?!
Bluey: That's why I didn't want to play Ground's Lava.
Bingo: Then why did you?
Bluey: Cause you always cry when I don't play with you.
Bingo: Because you always promise to play with me, and then you don't.
Bluey: But I had a reason!
Bingo: But you didn't tell me the reason.
Bluey: Cause I didn't want to upset you. Oh, no! Bingo, we're squabbling!
Bingo: I'm sorry, Bluey.
Bluey: I'm sorry too, Bingo.
Bluey: Hey, that squabble felt good.
Bingo: Yeah, but how do we deliver the letter?
Bluey: Mmm...
Bluey: Bingo, we can make an airplane!
Bingo: Yeah!
Bluey: Open the book.
Bingo: Okay.
Bluey: What's the first step?
Bingo: Fold it down the middle.
Bluey: Okay.
Bingo: Move your foot.
Bingo: And then fold the top bits.
Bluey: Okay, folding the top bits.
Bingo: No, no, the other way.
Bluey: I'm doing it the other way.
Bingo: You're not.
Bluey: Bingo, we're still squabbling!
Bingo: Yeah!
Bluey: Okay, ready?
Bingo: Ready.
Bluey: And fly!
Bluey: Go, love heart plane!
Bluey and Bingo: That's it, that's it!
Bluey and Bingo: What? No!
Bluey: Dad's gonna love Judo's mum!
Bingo: Go back, go back!
Bluey: Whoo...
Bluey and Bingo: Thanks, brother wind!
Bingo: That's it.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
