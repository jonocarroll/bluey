The episode starts outside, with Stripe, Bandit, Bingo and Bluey walking to the squash hall. Bluey sits atop Bandits' head, with Bingo on Stripes', holding onto their ears as if to "guide" them. As they're walking, Bingo pulls up and guides Stripe to ram into Bandit, causing the latter to stumble.
Bluey: "Dad, stay on the path!" 
Bandit: "Oh! Phew!"
Bandit regains his footing, and the four continue walking.
Bandit: "Get 'em, Bluey!" 
Bluey guides Bandit into Stripe, causing him to stumble off the path into a bush.
Bandit: "Yeah! Nice one, Bluey!" 
Stripe: "Get us out of here, Bingo!"
Bingo: "I'm trying!" 
Bingo tugs up on Stripe's ears, attempting to free themselves.
Bandit: "Big brothers always beat little brothers! That's just the way it goes!" 
Bluey: "Yeah, that's just the way it goes!"
Bingo and Stripe groan in annoyance.
EPISODE TITLE: Squash
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Squash." 
The shot cuts to the squash hall, where Bandit and Stripe are warming up. Bluey and Bingo watch on, tails wagging.
Bandit: "I'm gonna pound you."
Stripe: "Yeah right!"
Bluey: "What can we play while you squash?"
Bandit: "Uhh, well, you can still control us!"
Bluey & Bingo: "Hooray!"
Bandit: "Here, this can be the controller!"
He hands Bluey the squash racket bag.
Bluey: "I'll control Dad. He always wins!"
Bingo & Stripe: "Hey!" 
Bandit smirks, and pulls Bluey in to give her a pat.
Bandit: "Such a wise head on such young shoulders."
Bingo: "Okay, I'll control Uncle Stripe."
She reaches out for the squash racket bag, to which Stripe hands her it.
Stripe: "Do your best, Bingo." 
Bingo: "I promise I will." 
The shot cuts to Bandit and Stripe entering the enclosed squash game space.
Bandit: "Alright, let's do this!" 
Stripe: "Yeah!"
As the door closes, Bluey and Bingo run up to spectate...or rather, control the two players.
Bluey: "Come on, Bingo!"
The two sit down, giggling as they ready the "controllers".
Bandit: "Test us out, kids!" 
Bluey: "Okay! This way!" 
Bandit: "Whoa!"
She yanks to the right, sending Bandit to the wall.
Bingo: "Go...up!" 
Stripe: "Aaaah!" 
She yanks straight ahead, sending Stripe to the opposite side of the wall. She giggles as Stripe collides with the wall. The shot then cuts back to Bluey, who is rotating her controller joystick in a circle.
Bluey: "Round and round..." 
Bandit: "Whoa whoa whoa...!" 
Bingo: "And this way!" 
She sends Stripe into the wall...again.
Bingo: "Okay, they work!" 
A dizzied bandit spins over to the center, as Stripe does the same albeit taken aback by the wall slams. Both of them pant, before they get their footing again.
Bandit: "Okay, we're good to go!" 
Bluey: "You ready, Bingo?"
Bingo: "Ready!" 
Bandit bounces the ball, before stancing up as he glances back at Bluey.
Bluey: "Boop!"
She presses the controller, before Bandit goes off to play. He swings at the ball, sending it to the wall.
Bingo: "Aah!"
She yanks on the controller, causing Stripe to miss the ball and to hit his head on the wall again. Bluey and Bandit relish in their point score.
Bandit & Bluey: "Yes!" 
Bandit walks over to pick up the ball.
Bandit: "One, zero." 
Bingo: "Awww.."
Bandit: "Nice one, Bluey!" 
Bluey's tail wags, and she gives a thumbs up to Bandit. She turns to give Bingo a competitive glare.
Bandit: "So it BEGINS!" 
The two continue playing, an intense game unfolding, before Stripe messes up again and runs into the wall, falling to the ground in the process.
Bandit & Bluey: "Yeah!" 
The game continues going, with Bandit managing to hit the ball every time, whereas Stripe struggles. It ends with him tripping over.
Bandit & Bluey: "Yes!"
The shot then cuts to Stripe readying up the start of the game. He throws the ball up into the air, and proceeds to swing and miss.
Stripe & Bingo: "Aw."
And so the game continues. Bandit so elegantly continues to play without fault, while a worn out and sweaty Stripe struggles to keep his head in the game. As he tries to catch his breath, the ball comes flying at him and strikes him in the snout. Bingo looks discouraged.
Bingo: "Something's wrong with this..
Bandit and Stripe continue playing, with Stripe failing to hit the ball once again.
Stripe: "Ugh, why do I keep losing!?" 
Bandit: "Because big brothers always beat little brothers!"
Bingo: "Awwww..." 
Bandit walks over to pick up the ball.
Bandit: "Okay, one more point and we win, Bluey. Make it happen!" 
Bluey: "Okay!" 
The shot cuts over to an out-of-breath Stripe regaining his stamina, as Bingo looks up at him.
Stripe: "Just do your best, Bingo." 
Bingo: "I'm trying, but my controller isn't working properly." 
Bandit: "I don't think it's the controller, kid."
Stripe: "This isn't over!" 
The final match ensues. Bandit and Bluey play flawlessly as he did all previous times, while Stripe and Bingo struggle. Stripe loses the game, as he hits the glass and falls to the ground.
Bandit: "Yes!"
Bluey: "Yeah!" 
Stripe: "Ugh...now it's over..." 
Stripe lies in a pooling puddle of his own sweat (revolting), as Bingo drops her controller, saddened.
Bingo: "Aww....I didn't even win once." 
Bluey: "Big sisters always beat little sisters. That's just the way it goes!"
Bluey and Bandit dance, relishing in their victory over the younger dogs. A discouraged Bingo gets up and leaves.
Bingo: "I'm going to the bubbler." 
Bluey: "Oh, Bingo!" 
Bandit: "Let's go again!" 
Stripe: "Yep, j-just let me get a drink."
An exhausted Stripe leaves for the bubbler. Bandit walks over to sit next to Bluey.
Bandit: "Nice controlling, kid!" 
Bluey: "Dad, can you please let Uncle Stripe win the next squash?" 
Bandit: "What, why?" 
Bluey: "Cause I don't think Bingo's having any fun." 
Bandit: "Aww, you're such a good big sister." 
Bluey smiles and her tail wags a little.
Bluey: "So can you?" 
Bandit: "Nope!" 
Bluey: "What!? Why not?" 
Bandit: "That's not how grown-ups work, kid." 
Bluey: "But it's how kids work!"
Bandit: "Then kids are silly!"
Bluey: "What!? How very dare you!" 
Bandit: "Nyah nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah, kids are silly!" 
Bluey: "That is it! I'm going to make you lose the next squash!"
Bandit: "What? No! I take it back! Kids aren't silly! Please! Don't make me lose!" 
Bluey: "Too late."
The shot cuts to Stripe hastily guzzling down water at the bubbler. Bingo is poking his tail, in an attempt to "fix" him.
Stripe: "What are you doing, Bingo?" 
Bingo: "I'm fixing you." 
Stripe: "Fixing me?" 
Bingo: "Yeah! This is the antenna bit that makes the controller work." 
Stripe: "Oh, is it not working properly?" 
Bingo: "No. You're not doing what I'm controlling you to do, and Bluey keeps beating me!" 
Stripe: "Aw. Look, I'm sorry, Bingo. Maybe you guys should swap for the next game?" 
Bingo: "No, I want to control you." 
Stripe: "Are you sure? You'll probably have a better chance of winning with your dad!" 
Bingo: "No, I want us to win." 
Stripe: "Oh really? Why's that?"
Bingo: "Because big sisters don't always beat little sisters." 
Bingo's optimistic words causes Stripe to tear up a little, as he gives an emotional sniff. Bingo is done adjusting Stripe's tail.
Bingo: "There, I fixed you!" 
Stripe: "Yeah, Bingo. You did." 
The shot cuts back to Bandit and Bluey. Bandit is on his knees begging Bluey to not let him lose.
Bandit: "Oh please, don't make me lose! I'll give you a hundred chocolate koalas!" 
Bluey: "Nope!" 
Stripe and Bingo enter, their confidence reignited and their competitiveness even more so.
Stripe: "You ready?" 
Bandit: "Aah!" 
As Stripe enters, a nervous Bandit is on his last legs in an attempt to continue as a victor in the game.
Bandit: "Bingo, it's your turn to control me instead of Bluey!"
Bingo: "Nope!"
Bandit: "Pleeaaase!" 
Stripe: "Let's do this, Bingo!"
The game begins. Stripe gives a cold, competitive glare, while the nervous Bandit readies up to the best of his abilities. Bingo smiles, and Bluey gives her a wink, indicating their unintentional plans coming together.
Bingo: "Boop."
Stripe yells, before striking the ball with all his might. Bandit attempts to swing, but Bluey's control shifts, causing him to completely miss as it flies by in a slowmo fashion.
Bandit: "Wow."
Stripe picks up the ball.
Stripe: "One, zero."
Bingo: "Yeah!" 
The game continues going, with the two hitting it back and forth before Bandit misses the ball once again.
Bandit: "Bluey!" 
Stripe & Bingo: "Yes!" 
As the game continues going, Bandit becomes more worn out, sweating and out of breath and attempting to chase the ball to the best of his abilities. Stripe sends the ball to him, as it hits Bandit in the back.
Stripe: "Oooh, right in the love handle!" 
Bandit: "Grrrr!" 
More of the game progresses on...Bandit fails once again, giving Stripe another point.
Stripe: "Woo! Okay Bingo, one more point and we've won! You can do this!"
Bingo: "We can do this!" 
The final match ensues. Bandit attempts to catch his breath, but Stripe begins playing straight away. The music begins to crescendo, a satisfying climax reached for the younger dogs overcoming their older siblings.
Stripe: "Strength!" 
Bandit is becoming increasingly worn out...
Stripe: "Agility!"
Even more so...
Stripe: "Determination!" 
Bandit is on his last stand. As he rushes to strike the ball, Bluey suddenly shifts her controller, turning it upside down which throws Bandit off of his footing.
Bandit: "Whoa, whoa WHOA--!" 
Bandit slams into the glass wall, causing Bluey to giggle and wave at him. The match is won by Stripe and Bingo!
Stripe: "YEAAHH!!" 
Bingo: "Woooo! We won!" 
Bandit: "Uuuugh..." 
Stripe holds his hand out for Bandit, as he pulls him up.
Bandit: "Good game, little brother."
Stripe: "Yeah, thanks mate!" 
Bluey: "Good game, little sister." 
Bingo: "Thanks, Bluey!" 
The camera cuts to the four heading home after their game.
Bandit: "What a squash!" 
Stripe: "Yeah man, that was awesome!" 
Bandit: "I guess little brothers can beat big brothers." 
Bingo: "Yep! That's just the way it goes." 
The four laugh.
Stripe: "Good one, Bingo." 
Bandit: "But I still say kids are silly!" 
Bluey: "What!?"
Bluey yanks to the left, sending Bandit straight into a bush.
