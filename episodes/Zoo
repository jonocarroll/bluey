The episode opens in the Heeler house with Chilli and Bandit reading in the living room, until Bluey and Bingo appear into the room.
Bluey: Hey, Mum! Can you play zoo with us? Bingo’s gonna be Snowdrop, the toddler.
Bingo: And Mum’s gonna be Mum!
Chilli: Okay.
Bluey: I’m gonna be Zookeeper! What about you, Dad?
Bandit: I’ll lie on the couch and read the paper.
Bluey: No! We’ve got a special job for you.
Bandit: Uh-oh!
TITLE CARD: ZOO
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called, "Zoo".
Bluey: Good afternoon, Lady Gaberdine! Welcome to the zoo! I'm the zookeeper!
Chilli: Thank you! My precious little Snowdrop just adores animals.
Bingo: Animals! Animals!
Bluey: How about I show you some of them? Follow me.
Bluey: This is a gentle giraffe.
Bluey: He's very friendly.
Chilli: Ooh, how delightful.
Bingo: Giraffe!
Bluey: And if you follow me this way, you'll see our...
Bingo: Kangaroo! Kangaroo!
Bluey: Well, it's like a kangaroo, young lady, but smaller. It's a pademelon. Very friendly.
Bluey: I'm pretty sure they like eating melons.
Bingo: Boing, boing, boing!
Bluey: Now, this next one is definitely NOT friendly: he's a big stinky baboon!
Bandit: Ooh-ooh.
Bingo: Big blue monkey!
Chilli: Well, I rather thought we'd see more movement from the animals.
Chilli: What a brute! Stay back, Snowdrop.
Bluey: Oi, get up, you big ape! Our visitors don't want to see you lying around all day.
Bandit: Ooh.
Bluey: What?!
Bingo: Monkey sleep! Monkey sleep!
Bluey: That's it! Dance for the lady, you lazy ape!
Bandit: Ahhhh!
Chilli: Oh, my!
Bingo: Monkey scratch butt-butt!
Bluey: Ah, forget this guy. Come on, let's go see the kookaburras.
Chilli: Come along, Snowdrop.
Bandit: Ooh-ooh? Ooh-ooh-ooh. Ooh!
Bingo: Big blue monkey!
Bandit: Ooh-ooh! 
Bluey: These kookaburras think everything is funny.
Chilli: Ooh, look at these little darlings, Snowdrop. Snowdrop? 
Bingo: Snowdrop want hug.
Chilli: Snowdrop!
Chilli: That gorilla has Snowdrop!
Bingo: Snowdrop hug monkey! 
Bluey: Ugh! That's it! Don't worry, madam, I'll sort this out straight away! 
Chilli: Ooh! You be careful with that, won't you?
Bluey: He's not allowed to do this. It's against the monkey rules. 
Chilli: Watch out for my darling Snowdrop!
Bluey: Would you like to see our reptile section?
Chilli: No!
Chilli: Zookeeper, this is unheard of. I demand you rescue my little Snowdrop at once.
Bluey: Don't worry, madam, everything's under control. 
Bluey: There you are!
Bandit: Ooh! 
Bluey: Get back here, you big ape! This is not how you treat our visitors!
Chilli: Snowdrop, darling! Are you OK?
Bluey: Everything's OK, madam! Feel free to check out our emus!
Bluey: Vroom-vroom!
Bandit: Ooh-ooh.
Bluey: Vroom-vroom-vroom!
Bandit: Ooh-ooh-ooh.
Bluey: Hey! Get back here, ape!
Bandit: Ooh-ee-ee-ee-ah-ah-ah! 
Chilli: Snowdrop!
Bluey: Would you like to visit our gift shop?
Bingo: Hide in here, monkey.
Bandit: Ooh-ooh-ooh-ee-ee. Ooh? Ooh-ooh! 
Bingo: Me, Snowdrop. You...?
Bandit: Ooh-ooh?
Bingo: No, no. Me Snowdrop, you...?
Bandit: Ooh-ooh?
Bingo: You Ooh-Ooh. Snowdrop. Ooh-Ooh.
Bandit: Ooh-ooh. 
Bluey: That blue ape won't be able to resist this banana. And when he goes for it, we'll trap him!
Chilli: Well, I should say so. Goodness knows Snowdrop will be so worried without me!
Bandit: Ahh...Ooh-ooh! Ahh...Ooh-ooh! 
Chilli: How long will this take?
Bluey: Oh, I can hear them!
Bandit: Ooh-ooh? Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ee-ee-ee-ah-ah! 
Bingo: No!
Bluey: Stay down, you big baboon!
Bingo: Ooh-Ooh!
Chilli: Snowdrop! 
Bluey: I'll have to tickle the big fella to sleep! See? Everything's under control. You're a very lucky little girl, young lady.
Bingo: No! Ooh-Ooh!
Chilli: Snowdrop! 
Bingo: Ooh-Ooh! Ooh-Ooh... 
Chilli: Nighty night, my little Snowdrop.
Bingo: See Ooh-Ooh tomorrow?
Chilli: Goodness, no! I don't think we'll go back to that zoo anytime soon. 
Bingo: Snowdrop miss Ooh-Ooh. 
Bluey: Psst, Snowdrop! You've got a visitor.
Bluey: Hey, come here, you big baboon.
Bandit: Ooh-ooh-ee-ee!
Bingo: Ooh-Ooh!
Bingo: Ooh-Ooh.
Bandit: Ooh-ooh.
