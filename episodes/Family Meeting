The episode opens with a view of the Heeler home, and an argument at breakfast.
Bluey: You did!
Bandit: I didn't!
Bluey: You did!
Bandit: I did not!
Bluey: Did!
Chilli walks in
Chilli: (yawns) What's going on?
Bluey: Dad blew off right in my face!
Bandit: Did not!
Chilli: Ugh. Bandit, that's a new low!
Bandit: I didn't do it! Why doesn't anyone believe me?
Bingo: 'Cause you're the king of fluffies!
Chilli: I know how to settle this.
Chilli picks up a wooden spoon
Bingo: Yeah! Whack him!
Chilli: What? No.
Chilli taps table with said spoon, much like a gavel.
Chilli: Family meeting.
Bluey and Bingo: Oh!
TITLE CARD: "Family Meeting"
Chilli: This episode of Bluey is called "Family Meeting"
END TITLE CARD
Bluey: Time to pay Fluffy King!
Chilli catches up with the rest, with curlers on, looking almost like a judge's wig.
Chilli: Sorry, just had to put my curlers in.
Chilli taps spoon on table
Chilli: Alright, three rules: one person talks at a time, everyone says, "fluffy" when talking about Dad's... fluffy,
Bandit: Alleged fluffy.
Chilli: …and most importantly everyone tells the truth.
Bluey raises hand
Chilli: (points at Bluey) Yes, you.
Bluey: Do we say that Dad "fluffied" or Dad "fluffed"?
Bandit: Allegedly.
Chilli: Either.
Bluey: What about "he was baking brownies"?
Bluey and Bingo laugh
Bandit: Allegedly!
Chilli taps table
Chilli: Enough.
Bingo: What does "allegebly" mean?
Chilli: It means you both get to tell your side of the story and then I decide who's telling the truth, okay?
Bandit: Yes, Your Honour.
Chilli:(interested) Ooh, I like that. Fourth rule, everyone calls me your honour. Okay, Bluey, you first.
Bluey: Yes, Your Honour.
Scene cuts to a reconstruction on the table, starting with a toy bed and bedside.
Bluey: It all happened this morning. (Places a small dog toy on the bed) Mum, this you asleep, this is me (places a smaller dog toy beside the bed).
Chilli: And where was Dad?
Bingo searches through the toy box for a prop, and pulls out a toy skunk. The girls laugh as Bluey gleefully puts it on the bed next to "Mum".
Bluey: Here!
Bandit: (offended) Hey, your honor!
Chilli: I'll allow it.
Bluey: So I was just here, um, doing something, and Dad got out of bed (picks up "Dad"), turned (turns "him" around) and fluffied right in my face! (raspberries to mimic said fluffy, then gags and coughs)
Chilli: Well, I heard enough.
Bandit: (To Chilli) Hey, hang on!
Chilli: Oh yeah. Your side. Make it quick.
Bandit: (To Bingo) Here, give me.
Bingo gives Bandit the box of toys
Bandit: Check it. (Replaces Bluey's prop for Chilli with a prettier one) Mum was here sleeping, looking gorgeous as usual.
Chilli: Oh, well... (giggles)
Bingo and Bluey look annoyed
Bingo: Hey!
Bluey: You're trying to make Mum like you more!
Bandit: I got up, went downstairs, and got embroiled in this mess.
Bluey: Hey!
Bandit: What!
Bluey: You missed the bit where you fluffied!
Bingo: "Allegbly".
Bandit: It just doesn't sound like the sort of thing I'd do.
The rest of the family react in surprise
All but Bandit: Oh-oh-oh, yes it does!
Bandit: What!?
Flashback; the family are in an elevator. Bluey is resting next to Chilli and Bingo looks bored. Bandit, however, has a trick for her
Bandit: Hey Bingo, pull my finger. (shows finger to Bingo)
Bingo reacts to it as Mum and Bluey become startled hearing that
Bingo: Okay! (proceeds to pull said finger as Bandit prepares for the punchline)
Chilli and Bluey: (hopelessly) Bingo, NO!!
End flashback
Bandit: Well, fair enough. But on the morning of this morning, I did not bake a brownie!
Bluey: Ooh, I've got a idea.
Cuts back to table. Bluey pushes a can of beans and toast on a plate on a sign showing that it's exhibit "a".
Bluey: Is this what you had for breakfast yesterday? Baked beans on wheat toast?
Bandit: Yep.
Bluey: (walks to the next exhibit, a jar of sauerkraut) Bingo, what's the fluffy level on this?
Bingo: (doots as she rises the "fluffy meter"). High.
Bluey: Thank you. And then what did you have for lunch, Mr. Heeler?
Bandit: Ah, just some, um... (discretely) Sauerkraut?
Bluey: Excuse me?
Bandit: (clearly) Sauerkraut.
Bluey: Bingo, fluffy level?
Bingo: (doots and rises the "fluffy meter" higher)
Bluey: Now we had dinner at Indy's house, didn't we?
Bandit: Yep.
Bluey: Can you tell us what you ate?
Bandit: Uh, I'm not sure I ate much.
Chilli: Mr. Heeler!
Bandit: (defeated) Okay, I had a vegan nut roast.
Bingo: Poor dear! (rises meter again)
Bluey: Anything else?
Bandit: Uh, nothing comes to mind.
Bluey: Really? Nothing from the petrol station on the way home that might have gone on this tray? (lifts cloth over exhibit "c", revealing a small empty pie tin)
Bingo and Chilli gasp
Bandit: Oh, well, maybe I had a pie!
Chilli: (disappointed) Oh, Bandit!
Bandit: Well, all I had was nut roast!
Bluey: Bingo, where is the fluffy meter now?
Bingo: (doots as she maximizes the meter) At the top!
Chilli: Sounds like you were ready to blow.
Bandit: My food choices are not on trial!
A closeup on Chilli's hand as she bangs the table again, then cuts to the hearing chair of said table with Bingo on it
Bluey: Bingo, on the morning of this morning, did you see Dad fluffy in my face?
Bingo: Yes, I did.
Bandit: Oh, what?! Bingo, you weren't even there!
Bingo: (giggles) Yes, I was!
Bluey: Thank you, Bingo. You can leave. (whispers to her) Here's a lollipop. (gives Bingo said lollipop Bluey conveniently hid on her back)
Bingo squeals in joy as Bandit discovers this dishonesty
Bandit: Hey, Your Honour!
Chilli: (gets up from her chair) Bingo, are you fibbing to get a lollipop?
Bluey looks sheepish,
Bingo: Yes! (giggles)
…then concerned as Bingo dobbed on her
Chilli: Give me that.
Bingo: Aw... (disappointed, as she passes it to Bluey who then passes it to Chilli)
Chilli: Everyone forget that bit. (to Bluey) Bluey, that has not helped your case. Remember, the truth will set you free.
Bluey: Okay, Mum.
Bandit: (coughs) I would like to call on... Mum!
Bluey and Bingo gasp
Chilli: Me!?
Cuts to table with the reconstruction bed, with similar setup as previously, then the hearing chair, this time with Chilli.
Bandit: Mrs. Heeler, on the morning of this morning, you didn't hear me fluffy, did you?
Chilli: No.
Bandit: Let's repeat that, you didn't hear me fluffy.
Bluey: 'Cause she was asleep!
Chilli: Yeah. Well, I wasn't asleep. I was dozing. I mean, (to Bandit) I heard you get up and move the bedside table.
Bandit looks surprised
Bandit: What?
Bluey: Oh, really? (to Chilli) Tell me about this bedside table.
Bandit: (hastily) Um, no further questions, You Honour. You can go now, come on. Get. 
Cuts back to reconstruction bed
Chilli: Well, Dad charges the tablet on his bedside table at night. And sometimes he knocks it off when he gets up. 
Cuts back to hearing chair, as Bandit beside Chilli gets increasingly neurotic
Chilli: And he has to move the table to get it. And it makes this horrible scraping sound like, (tries to vocalize what she heard, then comes realization) oh, no!
Bluey: He didn't move the table! That sound was the fluffy!
Bingo screams as she holds on to her sister.
Chilli: Bandit!
Bandit: (nervously) Well, maybe we should hear from... Uh, that guy? (points to a direction)
All but Bandit: (looking at the direction) What guy?
Bandit makes a run for it
Bluey and Bingo: Ah! He's running away!
Chilli: Get him, kids!
The kids has their dad in pursuit around the house
Bandit: You'll never catch me alive!
Bandit leaps over a couch then tries to hide behind a plant. After he thinks his kids lost him, he makes another run for it. Fortunately, they manage to get to him in time as he was about to get off from the backyard.
Bandit: Freedom!
Bandit jumps to the backyard, followed by the kids. They are finally able to subdue him as they triumphantly giggle and tickle him.
Bandit:: Ah, get off me! (laughs)
Scene cuts to another closeup of Chilli hitting the table, followed by a shot of Dad tied up with a jump rope held by Bingo, all next to Bluey.
Chilli: (to Bandit) Is there something you'd like to say?
Bandit: Whoever smelt it, dealt it?
Chilli: (knocks the table again as all eyes are closer to Bandit) Mr. Heeler!
Bandit: Okay, okay, I fluffied.
Chilli: In your child's face?
Bandit: Her face is at bum level! It's hard not to!
Chilli: Well, I seem to manage.
Bandit: Oh, like you don't bake the odd brownie.
Chilli: Bandit!
Bingo: That could've been me!
Chilli knocks the table as she states the sentence
Chilli: I sentence you to one hour playing "Horsey Ride", with the defendant (points at Bluey), and her sister (points at Bingo).
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Chilli: See, Bluey? The truth will set you free.
Bandit: Well, let's test that out, shall we? I have one last question.
Chilli: Okay.
Bandit: (walks closer to Bluey, Bingo holds him) The truth's gonna set someone free. Bluey, what were you doing at bum level on the morning of this morning?
Bluey: Oh! Uh...
Chilli: Bluey?
Bluey: Okay. I was playing computer games on the tablet.
Chilli gasps
Bandit: Even though Mum said you weren't allowed to play computer games until the weekend?
Bluey: (sheepishly giggles) Yes.
Chilli: Bluey Christine Heeler! (knocks the table again) I sentence both of you to horsey rides. Saddle up, Bingo!
Bingo: Hooray! ("whips" Bandit with a sticky hand then runs off squealing)
Bandit: Hey!
Bandit, now without Bingo, puts down the jump rope around his waist. Bluey walks up to him.
Bluey: I'm sorry, Dad.
Bandit: I'm sorry, Bluey.
They both hug, which is followed by Chilli getting up after pushing the chair away, with a rather strange sound.
Chilli: (knocks table again, hastily) Okay, family meeting over, everyone out!
Bandit: Huh?
Chilli: Come on, quickly! (starts waving her hands to shoo them away)
Bluey: Why do we have to leave so fast?
Bandit: Yeah, what's the hurry?
Chilli: Come on, out!
Bandit: Hang on...
Bandit and Bluey: What's that smell?
Chilli: Out, out, come on!
Bandit and Bluey: (gasp, then point to Chilli, who looks sheepish) Mum fluffied!
(Chilli stops flapping hands and looks sheepish)
