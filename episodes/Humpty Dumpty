TITLE CARD - Humpty Dumpty
The short opens with a view of the Heeler house. Three birds fly across the screen, then we cut to the living room. Chilli sits in the middle of the rug and presses something on her phone. Muffin is trying to get onto a big foam block and Bingo, Bluey and Socks are sitting off to the side, watching.
Chilli: "Sing a song for Grandad and we'll send it to 'im!"
She taps and swipes on her phone.
Chilli: "Ready... go!"
She puts the phone up to Muffin. She struggles to think of something to sing.
Muffin: "Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall! Humpty Dumpty had a great fall! All the kids and mummies... all the kings... and the horses couldn't put Humpty together again!"
Chilli chuckles.
Chilli: "Okay, one more. You ready?"
Muffin nods and Chilli taps a button.
Chilli: "Go!"
Muffin: "Humpty... Dumpty... sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the king's horses and all the king's men! Couldn't... couldn't put Humpty together again."
While Muffin sings, we can hear giggling coming from the other girls. Muffin timidly shrugs to Chilli.
Muffin: (angrily) "Why are you laughing?"
The others can't contain themselves. Bingo falls on the floor while Socks and Bluey giggle to themselves. Muffin crosses her hands and looks sternly at them, but her stern expression turns to silent giggling. It eventually quietens down.
Chilli: "Okay, let's try "Twinkle, Twinkle"."
Chilli hits 'record' again.
Muffin: (confidently and quickly) "Twinkle, twinkle, little star! How I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high! Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star! How... how I wonder what you are!"
Chilli: "That's great!"
Chilli, Bingo and Bluey: "Hooray!"
Everyone stars to laugh again.
