The episode opens on the Heeler family's balcony outside of the kitchen. Bandit is standing on top of the table in front of the patio table and handing dirty leaves from the dirt-covered gutter down to the trash bag that Chilli is holding. As Bandit grabs for a second handful, part of the gutter falls and hits the railing, scattering some stray leaves. Bandit lets out a yelp as Chilli gasps.
Bandit: Ah, that’s no good.
Chilli: (grabs a stray leaf and adds it to her trash bag) This house is falling apart.
Bandit: Well, nothin’ lasts forever.
Chilli: Yeah, I guess.
Bandit: It’s just got character.
Bluey and Bingo enter, each holding a slice of watermelon, the “red” of Bluey’s slice being a somewhat paler color.
Bluey: Dad, Bingo’s watermelon is redder than mine.
Bandit: No, it isn’t.
Bingo: Yeah, it is.
Bluey: See?
Bandit: Oh, yeah. Well, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
Bingo licks her watermelon slice.
Bluey: What does that mean?
Pat: (off screen, calling out) Hey Bandit!
The camera shifts to show the view towards Lucky’s yard, where Pat is standing next to a brick pizza oven. The Heelers move closer to the railing for a better view. The scene zooms in on Pat, surrounded by cardboard, tools, and paper instructions.
Pat: Check it out! (points to oven) New pizza oven! (leans an elbow on the edge of the pizza oven) Pretty sweet, aye?
The scene cuts back to the Heelers observing.
Pat: (off screen) I just got it from Hammerbarn!
Bluey and Bingo: Ooh!
Bandit: We’re going to Hammerbarn.
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah, Hammerbarn!
Chilli: Gee, his lawn’s looking green.
TITLE CARD - Two near identical garden gnome dogs, the left of which has a shovel under its arm, and the episode title.
Bluey : This episode of Bluey is called Hammerbarn.
The scene transitions to a wide view of the parking lot of the Hammerbarn hardware store.
Bluey: (off screen) Will the pizza taste better from the pizza oven?
Bandit: (off screen) Yep.
Chilli: (off screen) Nope.
The scene transitions to the inside of Hammerbarn. As Chilli picks out a trolley, Bluey and Bingo each have a small sausage covered in tomato sauce and wrapped in a slice of bread. Bluey takes a bite of hers.
Bingo: Dad, Bluey got more sauce than me.
Bandit: No, she didn’t.
Bandit approaches a Labrador employee.
Bandit: Hey, mate, where are your pizza ovens?
Employee: Aisle 300, left at the fake grass. If you hit a flamingo, you’ve gone too far.
The scene cuts back to Chilli rolling out a trolley.
Bluey and Bingo: Trolley!
Bandit: I’m going to aisle 300.
Bluey and Bingo quickly scarf down the rest of their sausages as Chilli sets a flat box of tomato wire in the trolley.
Chilli: Okay, we’ll head to the garden center. Come on, kids.
Chilli lifts Bluey, who props up the box in the middle of the trolley, then Bingo into the trolley’s child seat.
Bluey: Ooh Bingo! These can be our houses!
Bingo: Yeah! (gestures to the half of the trolley in front of her) This is my yard (points to the half in front of Bluey) and that’s yours!
Bluey: Yeah!
The scene transitions to Chilli pushing the trolley through the garden center, humming the main theme. She stops and hands a potted plant and a small succulent to Bluey to set in her half of the trolley.
Bluey: Ooh! Hey, Bingo. Look, I’ve got a garden!
The camera zooms out to show that two identical plants are in Bingo’s half as well.
Bingo: Yeah, me too!
Chilli is returning with a garden gnome dog holding a shovel, setting it in front of Bingo.
Chilli: Can’t have too many of these.
Bingo: Ooh, you could be my husband.
Bingo hugs the gnome and pats its head affectionately as Bluey peeks over the barricade.
Bluey: Hey, no fair! I want a husband, too.
Chilli begrudgingly hands another gnome, this one without a shovel, to Bluey.
Chilli: Yes, yes. Here you go. Same as Bingo.
Bluey: (giggles) Hello, husband.
Bingo: (exaggerated masculine voice to voice her gnome “husband”) Hello. My name is Hecuba.
Bluey: (similar masculine voice to voice her “husband”) Ooh, hello, Hecuba. My name’s Gerald.
Bingo: (pointing out “Hecuba”’s shovel, voice as “Hecuba”) I’m going to do some yard work. (normal voice as she moves the gnome around) Dig, dig, dig. Dig, dig, dig, dig. Dig, did, dig, dig.
Bluey looks over at “Gerald”.
Bluey: Hey, Gerald doesn’t have a shovel. Mum, Bingo’s husband is better than mine! (points at “Hecuba”)
Chilli: Just try and be happy with what you’ve got, okay?
Bluey: I can’t be happy with what I’ve got when what she has is better!
Bluey hands “Gerald” over to Chilli, who returns him to the shelf in exchange for a gnome with a shovel. She hands it to Bluey.
Chilli: Here.
Bluey: Thanks, Mum. Hello, new husband.
The scene transitions to another aisle as Chilli pushes the trolley. Bingo is humming.
Bingo: What a lovely veggie patch, Hecuba.
Chilli sets a small box of fairy lights in Bingo’s “yard”.
Chilli: Fairy lights.
Bingo: Ooh!
Bluey: Hey, why does Bingo-
Chilli sets another box into Bluey’s “yard”.
Chilli: And more fairy lights that are just the same.
Bluey: Thank you. These can be our pizza ovens.
Bluey and Bingo hold out their fists as if holding pan handles, shifting them to cook imaginary pizza.
Bluey and Bingo: Cook, cook, cook, cook. Cook, cook.
Chilli sets a pizza cutter with a protector around the blade into Bingo’s “yard”.
Bingo: (grabs the pizza cutter) Oh look, Hecuba, a pizza flipper. (shifts the “flipper” around) Cook, cook, cook. (raises the “flipper”) Flip. (repeats motions) Cook, cook, cook. Flip.
As Bingo continues, the camera zooms out to Chilli checking the price tag of a metal spatula.
Bluey: Mum, can we get two pizza flippers, please?
Chilli: We don’t need two. Try swapping something with Bingo.
Bingo: Cook, cook, cook. (stops when Bluey addresses her)
Bluey: (holds up her small succulent) Bingo, will you swap some of my plants for your pizza flipper?
Bingo: (holds the “flipper” defensively) No thanks. (raises “flipper”) Flip!
Bluey: (picks up “Gerald”) What about for my husband?
Bingo: No thanks! (raises “flipper”) Flip!
Bluey: Aww, but that pizza flipper is all I want in the whole world!
Bingo: (whining) Okay. (hands over the “flipper”)
Bluey: Thanks Bingo. (giggles, repeating Bingo’s motions) Cook, cook, cook. Flip! Cook, cook, cook. Flip!
Cut back to Chilli picking up a pizza stone from a shelf.
Chilli: Ooh, pizza stone!
Chilli sets the stone on top of Bingo’s fairy light box.
Bingo: (gasp) A dining table!
Bluey: Aww! I’ll swap you back the pizza flipper for your dining table!
Bingo: (holds the “dining table” defensively) No way!
Bluey: Bingo! (grabs the “table” and tries to pull it to her side) I want a turn with it.
Bingo: Hey! (pulls it back)
Bluey: (pulls back) Give it to me!
Bingo: (pulls) Bluey!
Bluey: (pulls) Let go of it, Bingo!
Bingo: (pulls) Give it to me, Bluey!
Bluey’s pull on the “dining table” becomes too powerful for Bingo to pull against, her grip quickly slipping off. Her elbow hits “Hecubah”, causing him to fall over the side of the trolley and shatter on the floor. Chilli gasps.
The scene cuts to Aisle 300, where Bandit is standing next to a brick pizza oven identical to Pat’s, conversing with an employee.
Bandit: So, how many BTU’s has this one got?
Chilli: (off screen, yelling distantly) BLUEY!!!
Both Bandit and the employee flinch.
Bandit: Ehh, it’s probably another Bluey.
The scene cuts back to the previous aisle. Bluey and Bingo have been taken out of the trolley seat. Bingo appears glum.
Bluey: I’m sorry!
Chilli: (pointing out the shattered “Hecubah”) This is what happens when you’re unhappy with what you’ve got. (makes a chopping motion into her palm) Someone’s husband eventually gets it!
Bluey: I just wanted the dining room table.
Chilli: (kneels down to Bluey’s level) You can’t just get new stuff all the time.
Bluey: Why not?
Chilli: Because stuff costs money. There’s no magical place where everything’s just free.
Bingo: (pointing off screen) Bluey, look!
The scene transitions to Bingo and Bluey excitedly facing a colorful row of paint samples. The music briefly changes to the tune of Handel’s “Hallelujah” chorus.
Bingo: It’s everything we want!
Chilli approaches as Bluey excitedly points out the samples.
Bluey: Are these all for free?
Chilli: Yes, they’re all for free.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
The scene transitions to Bluey and Bingo in the trolley, decorated with paint samples. Bluey’s “yard” has a green field, while Bingo’s is yellow. Each has a patch of blue bordered by orange to represent pools. Bluey has formed a pizza with some samples with some pieces shredded as toppings on top of her fairy light box. She continues to shred a black-colored square. Bingo is stacking a few colors into a hamburger on top of her “dining table”.
Bluey: (exaggerated posh voice) Hmm, Gerald, I’ll put olives on your half, my dear. (sprinkles her black shreddings on part of the “pizza”, turns to Bingo) Sharralanda, darling, you wouldn’t have some lettuce I could borrow, would you?
Bingo: (posh voice) Of course, Rhonda. (picks up some green shreddings and hands to Bluey)
Bluey: Thanks, darling. (sprinkles the “lettuce” onto the “pizza”)
Bingo: (picks up her “hamburger”) I’m just enjoying this hamburger. Poor Hecuba. He always loved hamburgers.
Bluey: Would you like to try some beetroot? (picks up hot pink shreddings)
Bingo: Oh, thank you, darling. (puts the “beetroot” under the top layer of her “burger”)
Bluey: Isn’t it nice having everything?
Bingo: Yes, it is.
Chilli: Just try not to get used to it, okay?
Bluey: Oh, it’s that lady who said we can’t have everything we want!
Bingo: Don’t listen to her, Rhonda!
The scene cuts to later down the aisle. The trolley has stopped and a distant beeping can be heard.
Bluey: Oh, that pizza was delicious. (returns to her normal voice) Hey, why have we stopped?
Bingo: (normal voice) And what’s that dooting?
The checkout lady takes the succulent from Bingo’s “yard” as Chilli takes both plants from Bluey’s side.
Bingo: Hey!
Bluey: Aah! My plants! What are you doing?
The camera shifts to show the checkout lady scanning the succulent from Bingo’s “yard”.
Checkout Lady: Hi guys! I have to scan all your stuff, okay?
Bingo gasps.
Bluey and Bingo: We’re at the checkout!
Chilli takes the fairy lights box from Bluey’s side, causing the scraps of “pizza” to flutter off.
Bluey: Aah! My pizza oven! Give it back!
The “hamburger” falls apart as the checkout lady tries to take the pizza stone from Bingo, who is trying her hardest to tug it back. Bluey holds “Gerald” defensively.
Bingo: No! Don’t take my dining table!
Bingo loses the tug of war for her “dining table”.
Chilli: We have to pay for it!
The checkout lady takes “Gerald” from Bluey’s arms. She tries to reach out for him.
Bluey: Gerald!
Chilli: Bluey, relax!
Bluey: (squirming in her seat) She’s taking my husband!
The checkout lady hesitatingly scans the garden gnome as the camera zooms out to show Bandit, carrying the box for the pizza oven on a flatbed cart.
Bandit: Uh, I might meet you in the car.
He pushes his cart away. The scene transitions to show the screen at the register with items gradually appearing, the beeping heard in the background. The shot then cuts to the Heelers, sans Bandit. Bluey and Bingo, dejected, are holding small boxes with their paint sample scraps, while Chilli holds a bigger box with the plants and the pizza stone in it.
Bluey: We worked so hard on our houses.
Bingo: I wasn’t ready to take them down.
Chilli: I know. I guess nothing lasts forever.
The scene cuts back to the checkout lady, holding her handheld scanner and four boxes of lightbulbs.
Checkout Lady: Hey, would you kids like to try my beeper gun?
Bluey: (sets down her box) Yes, please!
Checkout Lady: (kneels to Bluey’s level and hands her the scanner) Here you go!
The lady holds out one of the boxes for Bluey to scan. She squeals and giggles as she scans it, plus a second box.
Bingo: (touches Bluey’s shoulder) Can I have a turn? 
Bluey: (hands her the scanner) Yeah. Here you go.
Bingo squeals and laughs as she, holding the scanner with both hands, scans the last two boxes.
The scene fades to later in the evening. Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli are sitting at a picnic table as Bandit retrieves a pizza from the newly set up pizza oven.
Bandit: Okay, kids, are you ready for the best pizza you’ve ever tasted!
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!
Chilli: We’ll see about that.
Bandit: Ta-da!
Bandit sets a pizza stone with a puffy and lopsided pizza on top down on the table. The camera briefly zooms in on it to show that the cheese is oozing off of it, the toppings are falling off, and parts of it are slightly burnt. A piece of ham flops over during the zoom in. The scene zooms back out.
Bandit: Looks a bit bodgy.
Chilli: (sets a hand on Bandit’s shoulder) No. It’s just got character.
Bandit ruffles the top of Bluey’s head as each Heeler grabs a slice. Bingo’s is noticeably bigger than Bluey’s.
Bandit: Tuck in, kids. I’m just gonna give one to Lucky’s dad.
Bandit heads over to the fence as Bingo eats a loose piece of ham off of her slice.
Bluey: Hey! Yours is bigger than mine. But, that’s fine.
Chilli smiles at Bluey. The scene cuts to Bandit approaching Pat at the fence with a slice of pizza in hand.
Bandit: Hey, mate, have a go at this. Ham and pineapple. 
Bandit hands his slice over to Pat.
Pat: Aw, yeah. Swap you for a meat lover’s.
Pat passes a much thinner slice of pizza back over the fence.
Bandit: Nice!
Chilli: (off screen, mouth full) Oh, my goodness.
The scene cuts back to the other Heelers at the picnic table. Chilli is chewing her slice with a smile.
Bluey and Bingo: What is it?
Chilli: (swallows) This is amazing!
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
The scene cuts back to Bandit and Pat at the fence, silently exchanging a high-five.
During the end credits, the episode’s soundtrack plays as Cornelius walks on screen with a sauce-covered sausage in each hand. He finishes the one in his left hand in three bites, a few seconds apart.
