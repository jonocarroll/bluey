we open on a shot of a house owned by a family of Jack Russell Terriers. A few seconds later, a Jack Russell Terrier woman walks in through the door into the house. A young Jack Russell runs in from the left towards the woman, tail wagging. This is Jack, our focus for this episode.
Jack: Mum!
Jack's Mum: Hey, Jack! Oh!
The two share a tight hug while Jack wags his tail..
Jack's Mum: How was your first day at your new school?
Jack: Good.
Jack's mum: Tell me all about it.
Jack: Well, we drove there in the car and I couldn't sit still, as usual.
We cut to a shot inside a car. Jack is in a car seat, fidgeting and kicking his legs. A toddler is on the other side, sucking her thumb. This is Lulu, Jack's little sister. We then cut to the front of the car, where Jack's dad can be seen driving.
Jack's Dad: Come on, Jack. Can you sit still, mate?
Jack: Yes, Dad.
Jack sits mostly still, but ending up tugging on his seatbelt twice instead.
Jack's Dad: Did you remember your hat?
Jack: Um, my hat. Where's my hat?
Jack is distracted by a passing goat.
Jack: Ooh, look, a goat!
A goat can be heard bleating.
Jack's Dad: Jack, your hat?
Jack: I forgot it.
Jack's Dad: Oh, Jack, what are we going to do with you. mate?
Lulu points to her brother, who is back to fidgeting.
Lulu: Dad, Jack's still not sitting still!
Jack's Dad: Jaaaack.
Jack: Sorry, I forgot.
Lulu: Why can't you do as you're told?
Jack gets discouraged by his sister's words and thinks.
Jack: I don't know.
Jack looks out his window sadly.We cut to a zoom-in shot of Calypso's school, where parents can be seen dropping off their kids. We cut to a shot of the entrance to the school, where Calpyso can be seen petting Winton's head. Chloe can be seen riding Bluey as a horse, in the same attire she wore in the episode "The Adventure". Jack, Lulu and their dad walk up to Calypso.
Jack: Then we got to school and I met my teacher, Calypso.
Calypso: Well, hello.
Calypso: You must be my new student.
Jack: I'm Jack.
Lulu: Jack can't sit still or remember anything.
Jack growls while looking at Lulu, annoyed.
Calypso: Well, I think you should go and play with that red kelpie down there.
Calypso points to where Rusty is, offscreen.
Jack: Ok. Bye, Dad!
Jack's Dad: You have fun, mate!
Jack runs off to go play quickly.
Jack: I will!
Jack: And that's when I met Rusty.
Jack walks up to Rusty, who is wearing a camo cap with a crown badge on it. Rusty was fiddling around in a backpack until Jack came up to him.
Jack: What are you playing?
Rusty: I'm playing army.
Rusty: I'm about to go on Patrol.
Jack: Can I be in the army?
Rusty: Well, maybe.
Rusty: Can you do as you're told?
Jack: No. I'm not good at what I'm...
Rusty: Attention!
Jack snaps into a focused pose.
Jack: Ah!
Rusty: On the left! 
Jack turns the other way.
Rusty: Quick march!
Rusty leads Jack on a short distance march.
Rusty: Hup-hup-hup halt!
Jack halts right away.
Rusty: On the right!
Jack turns the other way again.
Rusty: March! 
Rusty leads Jack on another short distance march right back to where they were just standing.
Rusty: Hup-hup-hup halt!
Jack halts again.
Rusty: Salute!
Rusty salutes, and Jack follows suit a second later. Rusty goes back to digging through the backpack.
Rusty: Yeah, you can play.
Jack smiles wide and wags his tail. The title card appears. Jack narrates over the title card, which has a backpack with supplies around it.
Jack: This episode of Bluey is called Army.
We see Rusty explaining something to Jack, the two standing next to a patch of tall grass.
Rusty: You can't just start as a soldier. 
Rusty: You have to go through basic training.
Rusty: Where you learn all the stuff from your drill sergeant.
Rusty: That's me.
Jack: Oh. Ok.
Rusty: Where's your hat, Recruit Russell?
Jack: I forgot it, Sergeant.
Rusty pulls out a spare hat from his backpack.
Rusty: You can use my spare.
Rusty: But from now on, keep track of your own equipment.
Jack: Yes sergeant.
Rusty: Hup!
Jack salutes, but accidentally knocks the hat off his head.
Jack: Hup!
The two laugh at this. Jack and Rusty then enter the grass patch.
Jack: Rusty took me into the bush to learn army stuff.
Jack: The first thing I had to learn was heaps of hand signals.
Rusty puts his fist up to tell Jack to stop.
Rusty: Stop!
We cut to a demonstration of the hand signals, done by Jack in front of coloured backgrounds.
Jack: This one means "stop!"
Next, Jack puts his finger pointing up, then puts it pointing down.
Jack: This means "get down!"
Finally, Jack puts his hand up, then moves it to the side pointing to the right.
Jack: This is "move over there."
This marks the end of the hand singal demos. Rusty does the gesture for them to get down, and they do so, though Jack does so after a couple of seconds.
Jack: Ha!
A red frisbee is thrown into a small clearing around the grass. Coco runs in to grab it.
Coco: I'll get it! Huh?
Coco sees Jack and Rusty, laying on the ground while looking at her with serious expressions. Coco shrugs and runs off.
Jack: Now Rusty and I can talk to each other without talking.
Jack and Rusty give each other a thumbs up. We cut to a shot of Jack and Rusty doing push-ups.
Jack: An important part of the army stuff is doing push-ups.
Rusty: Good push-ups, Recruit Russell.
Jack and Rusty walk up to a view of a valley that has many features in it, including a tree, a bush and a hill.
Jack: Also, everything had a name.
Rusty points to a hill in the distance.
Rusty: Ok. That hill is called Hill Four.
He points to a nearby hill on the left.
Rusty: That one is called Hill Six.
Rusty points to a blue gum that's near them.
Rusty: That blue gum is called Tango Seven.
Rusty: You got that?
Jack looks down sadly.
Jack: Oh Sarge, I'm not good at remembering numbers or words.
Rusty: Well, you better get good if you want to be in the army, Recruit Russel.
Rusty: You need to know these things if we call for a dust-off.
Jack: A dust-off?
Jack appears in front of a purple background to explain what a dust-off is.
Jack: A dust-off is when you call in a helicopter to come and rescue you.
The explanation ends.
Rusty: You have to tell the chopper where to land.
Jack: Rusty loved calling for a dust-off.
The two do some more push-ups. Jack grunts as he does a push-up. Jack is then seen laying on a hill, looking around wgile being focused.
Jack: But the funnest bit was the sentry duty.
Jack: It's when you're a guard.
We zoom out to see that Jack and Rusty are on a hill. Jack is doing sentry duty as Rusty takes a nap.
Jack: You have to be on the lookout when the other soldiers sleep.
Jack: I loved it.
Jack: All the other soldiers are counting on you.
Jack: I was really good at sentry.
Rusty crawls next to Jack.
Rusty: You're really good at sentry.
Jack: Thanks, Sarge.
Rusty pulls out a cracker from his backpack and offers it to Jack.
Rusty: Have some rations, Recruit Russel.
Jack takes it and takes a bite.
Jack: "Rations" is what they call food in the army.
Rusty takes a bite.
Jack: How do you know so much about the army?
Rusty: 'Cause my dad's in the army.
Jack: Is he on patrol like us?
Rusty: Yeah, but not for long.
Jack: Oh, that's good.
Rusty: He said when he comes back, he's going to bring me some condensed milk.
Jack: Ahh, I love condensed milk!
We cut to Jack and Rusty going through the tall grass patch again.
Jack: Then the scariest bit happened.
Rusty gasps and does the gesture to get down. The two quickly get down.and walk up to a clearing where they see some grass rustling nearby. They watch to see who or what will come out. Eventually, a bush turkey pokes its head out of the grass.
Rusty: Contact!
Jack: What do we do?
Rusty: Fall back!
Jack and Rusty run away from the bush turkey.
Rusty: Get down!
They roll down a hill and sit by the bottom.
Rusty: There's too many of them!
Rusty: We have to call for a dust-off!
Rusty pulls out a small dotted cylindrical object from the backpack.
Jack: I told you he loved dust-offs.
Rusty speaks into the object as if it was a walkie-talkie.
Rusty: Six-one, this is six-two! We are surrounded! Request immediate dust-off. Stand by for location, over! 
Rusty looks at Jack.
Rusty: Recruit Russell, what's our location?
Jack looks up at the tree to try and remember.
Jack: It was all down to me.
Jack: I had to remember what that trail was called. Tango Five? No, Tango Six?
Jack squints his eyes, thinking harder until... he finds it!
Jack: Tango Seven!
Rusty speaks into the object again as a walkie-talkie.
Rusty: We're next to Tango Seven, over! 
Rusty gives Jack a thumbs-up.
Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.
Jack smiles at his praise.
Rusty: Oh, no! Negatives on the dust-off, Tango Seven. LZ is no good!
Rusty puts the object back in the backpack and zips it up.
Jack: I think he was saying the chopper had to land somewhere different.
Rusty: Recruit Russell, we've got to get to that field!
Jack: How?
Rusty: Run!
Rusty runs off.
Jack: One thing I can do is run. I'm a Jack Russell!
Jack can be seen running much faster than Rusty, passing him quickly.
Rusty: Whoa!
A treehouse on a hill can be seen. Jack and Rusty run towards it.
Rusty: Get to the chopper!
Jack: Ok!
The two enter the tree house.
Jack: Good thing we did all of those push-ups.
Jack: We made it!
Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.
The two share a laugh. We cut to later, where Jack is shown smiling at the view from the treehouse.
Jack: I can see why Rusty liked calling for dust-offs.
Rusty: Why did you come to this school? Was there something wrong with your old school.
Jack: No. There's something wrong with me. I'm not good at doing what I'm told, I can't sit still, and I can't remember anything, like numbers or letters or my hat.
Rusty: Oh.
The two go back to looking at the view.
Rusty: Well, you're really good at playing army.
We cut to the entrance of the grass where Calypso is seen petting Pretzel as Bluey walks past on all fours still. Rusty and Jack exit from the grass and walk up to Calypso.
Rusty: We're back from patrol, Calypso. You're all safe.
Calypso: Good boy, Rusty.
Rusty: Congratulations, Recruit Russel. You're now Private Russell.
Rusty salutes. Jack follows suit, smiling.
Jack: I was in the army.
Rusty: Come on, you can sit next to me.
Rusty runs off, Jack follows him not far behind.
Jack: And then it was pick-up time.
Parents can be seen picking up their kids at the entrance of the school. Rusty gives Jack a bottle of milk.
Jack: See you tomorrow, Rusty.
We cut back to Jack's house, where Jack finished explaining his day to his mum.
Jack: And now I'm here.
Jack's Mum: Wow, that was a lot of detail.
Jack: Yeah.
Jack's Mum pets her son on the head.
Jack's Mum: Good boy, Jack.
Jack pulls out the bottle that Rusty gave to him.
Jack: Oh, can I have my condensed milk now?
Jack's mum: Where'd you get condensed milk from?
Jack: Rusty gave it to me.
We cut back to the entrance of Calypso's school where Jack is seen waving good-bye to Rusty.
Rusty: See you, Jack!
A voice catches Rusty's attention.
Rusty's Dad: Hey! Rusty!
Rusty quickly runs up to hug his dad tight, with his tail wagging as well.
Jack: His dad brought it back from patrol.
The credits roll. Instead of Bluey dancing, the bush turkey from earlier comes in.
