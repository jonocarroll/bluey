Jack: Mum!
Jack's mum: Hey, Jack! Oh!
Jack's mum: How was your first day at your new school?
Jack: Good.
Jack's mum: Tell me all about it.
Jack: Well, we drove there in the car and I couldn't sit still, as usual.
Jack's dad: Come on, Jack. Can you sit still, mate?
Jack: Yes, Dad.
Jack's dad: Did you remember your hat?
Jack: Um, my hat. Where's my hat?
Jack: Ooh, look, a goat!
(goat maahs)
Jack's dad: Jack, your hat?
Jack: I forgot it.
Jack's dad: Oh, Jack, what are we going to do with you. mate?
Lulu: Dad, Jack's still not sitting still!
Jack's dad: Jaaaack.
Jack: Sorry, I forgot.
Lulu: Why can't you do as you're told?
Jack: I don't know.
Jack: Then we got to school and I met my teacher, Calypso.
Calypso: Well, hello.
Calypso: You must be my new student.
Jack: I'm Jack.
Lulu: Jack can't sit still or remember anything.
Jack: Grr!
Calypso: Well, I think you should go and play with that red kelpie down there. (the red kelpie Calypso is referring to is Rusty)
Jack: Ok. Bye, Dad!
Jack's dad: You have fun, mate!
Jack: I will!
Jack: And that's when I met Rusty.
Jack: What are you playing?
Rusty: I'm playing army.
Rusty: I'm about to go on Patrol.
Jack: Can I be in the army?
Rusty: Well, maybe.
Rusty: Can you do as you're told?
Jack: No. I'm not good at what I'm...
Rusty: Attention!
Jack: Ah!
Rusty: On the left! Quick march!
Rusty: Hup-hup-hup halt!
Rusty: On the right!
Rusty: March! Hup-hup-hup halt!
Rusty: Salute!
Rusty: Yeah, you can play.
Jack: This episode of Bluey is called Army.
Rusty: You can't just start as a soldier. 
Rusty: You have to go through basic training.
Rusty: Where you learn all the stuff from your drill sergeant.
Rusty: That's me.
Jack: Oh. Ok.
Rusty: Where's your hat, Recruit Russell?
Jack: I forgot it, Sergeant.
Rusty: You can use my spare.
Rusty: But from now on, keep track of your own equipment.
Jack: Yes sergeant.
Rusty: Hup!
Jack: Hup!
(both laugh)
Jack: Rusty took me into the bush to learn army stuff.
Jack: The first thing I had to learn was heaps of hand signals.
Rusty: Stop!
(Jack showing hand signals) 
Jack: This one means "stop!"
Jack: This means "get down!"
Jack: This is "move over there."
(Jack stops showing hand signals)
Jack: Ha!
Coco: I'll get it! Huh?
Jack: Now Rusty and I can talk to each other without talking.
Jack: An important part of the army stuff is doing push-ups.
Rusty: Good push-ups, Recruit Russell.
Jack: Also, everything had a name.
Rusty: Ok. That hill is called Hill Four.
Rusty: That one is called Hill Six.
Rusty: That blue gem is called Tango Seven.
Rusty: You got that?
Jack: Oh Sarge, I'm not good at remembering numbers or words.
Rusty: Well, you better get good if you want to be in the army, Recruit Russel.
Rusty: You need to know these things if we call for a dust-off.
Jack: A dust-off?
Jack: A dust-off is when you call in a helicopter to come and rescue you.
Rusty: You have to tell the chopper where to land.
Jack: Rusty loved calling for a dust-off.
Jack: (Grunts while doing push-ups)
Jack: But the funnest bit was the sentry duty.
Jack: It's when you're a guard.
Jack: You have to be on the lookout when the other soldiers sleep.
Jack: I loved it.
Jack: All the other soldiers are counting on you.
Jack: I was really good at sentry.
Rusty: You're really good at sentry.
Jack: Thanks, Sarge.
Rusty: Have some rations, Recruit Russel.
Jack: "Rations" is what they call food in the army.
Jack: How do you know so much about the army?
Rusty: 'Cause my dad's in the army.
Jack: Is he on patrol like us?
Rusty: Yeah, but not for long.
Jack: Oh, that's good.
Rusty: He said when he comes back, he's going to bring me some condensed milk.
Jack: Ahh, I love condensed milk!
Jack: Then the scariest bit happened.
(Rustling in grass)
(Rusty gasps)
(Rustling continues)
Rusty: Contact!
Jack: What do we do?
Rusty: Fall back!
Jack and Rusty: Arrgh!
(Turkey gobbles)
Rusty: Get down!
(Jack grunts)
Rusty: There's too many of them!
Rusty: We have to call for a dust-off!
Jack: I told you he loved dust-offs.
Rusty: (speaking into a dotted cylindrical object) Six-one, this is six-two! We are surrounded!
Rusty: Request immediate dust-off. Stand by for location, over! (stops speaking into object)
Rusty: Recruit Russell, what's our location?
Jack: It was all down to me.
Jack: I had to remember what that tree was called.
Jack: Tango Five?
Jack: No, Tango Six?
Jack: Tango Seven!
Rusty: (speaking into object once again) We're next to Tango Seven, over! (stops speaking into object)
Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.
Rusty: Oh, no! Negatives on the dust-off, Tango Seven.
Rusty: LZ is no good!
Jack: I think he was saying the chopper had to land somewhere different.
Rusty: Recruit Russell, we've got to get to that field!
Jack: How?
Rusty: Run!
Jack: One thing I can do is run.
Jack: I'm a Jack Russell!
(Jack zooms by Rusty)
Rusty: Whoa!
Rusty: Get to the chopper!
Jack: Ok!
Jack: Good thing we did all of those push-ups.
Jack: We made it!
Rusty: Great work, Recruit Russell.
(Both laugh)
Jack: I can see why Rusty liked calling for dust-offs.
Rusty: Why did you come to this school? 
Rusty: Was there something wrong with your old school.
Jack: No.
Jack. There's something wrong with me.
Jack: I'm not good at doing what I'm told, I can't sit still, and I can't remember anything, like numbers or letters or my hat.
Rusty: Oh.
Rusty: Well, you're really good at playing army.
Rusty: We're back from patrol, Calypso. 
Rusty: You're all safe.
Calypso: Good boy, Rusty.
Rusty: Congratulations, Recruit Russel. You're now Private Russell.
Jack: I was in the army.
Rusty: Come on, you can sit next to me.
Jack: And then it was pick-up time.
Jack: See you tomorrow, Rusty.
Jack: And now I'm here.
Jack's mum: Wow, that was a lot of detail.
Jack: Yeah.
Jack's mum: Good boy, Jack.
Jack: Oh, can I have my condensed milk now?
Jack's mum: Where'd you get condensed milk from?
Jack: Rusty gave it to me.
Rusty: See you, Jack!
Rusty's dad: Hey! Rusty!
Jack: His dad brought it back from patrol.
