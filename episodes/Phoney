The episode opens in the living room. Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo descend the last few steps. They climb over the back of the couch and recline on it.
Chilli: "Phew!"
Bluey and Bingo sigh in relief.
Chilli: "What a day!"
Bluey: (simultaneously) "Ch'yeah!"
Bingo: (simultaneously) "Yes!"
Chilli leans over and presses a button on a bluetooth speaker sitting on the coffee table.
Chilli: (enunciating) "Hey Phoney, play some relaxing music."
Phoney: "You got it."
The bluetooth speaker begins to play quiet music with drums and vibrophone.
Bandit, a mischievous look on his face, scuttles across the floor and hides behind the couch. A moment later, Unicorse emerges from behind the couch.
Bandit: (as Unicorse) "Hey Phoney, play some metal."
Phoney: "Okay, now playing metal."
The speaker begins playing a metal track with very loud percussion. Unicorse headbangs to the music, which makes Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: (as Unicorse) "Yaaaaah!"
Chilli: (speaking loudly) "Phoney, stop playing. STOP."
Phoney: "Okay."
The music stops. Chilli swipes at Unicorse with a throw pillow. Unicorse ducks back behind the couch.
Chilli: "Get outta here, you."
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Chilli: "Phoney, play relaxing music."
The relaxing music resumes. Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo all relax and close their eyes."
Bluey, Bingo: "Good one, Mum."
Unicorse pokes his head around the side of the couch.
Bandit: (as Unicorse) "Hey Phoney, play metal!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Hey!"
Unicorse headbangs again as the speaker switches back to metal music.
Bandit: (as Unicorse) "Yeahhh!"
Chilli grabs at the puppet, but she misses as he pulls back behind the couch.
Chilli: "Whup!"
Chilli: "Phoney, play—"
Unicorse pops up behind Bluey and Bingo."
Bandit: (as Unicorse) "—Louder!"
Unicorse resumes headbanging. Bluey and Bingo squeal with laughter.
Bandit: (as Unicorse) "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
He starts humming along with the music as he headbangs. Bingo and Bluey join in on the headbanging.
Chilli: "Kids, get him!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Okay, Mum!"
Bluey and Bingo leap over the back of the couch.
Bandit: "Aah!"
Bluey and Bingo squeal and laugh and Bandit grunts with effort as the three of them struggle; one of them occasionally coming into view over the edge of the couch.
Cut to a shot of the turntable and a potted plant. Bandit grunts with effort.
Bluey, Bingo: (off screen) "Ready?"
Cut to the couch, where Bluey and Bingo have a firm hold on Unicorse. Bluey has a grip on his upper and lower jaw.
Bluey, Bingo: (off screen) "Go!"
Bandit: (as Unicorse, nasally and resigned) "Hey Phoney, play relaxing music."
Bluey and Bingo laugh as the relaxing music resumes. Chilli lays back on the couch, looking satisfied.
Unicorse struggles as Bluey continues to hold his mouth shut.
Bandit: (as Unicorse, muffled) "Rrrgh, I hate it!"
