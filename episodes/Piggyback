Bingo: Aww.
Bandit: If it helps, I wouldn't have bought you one anyway.
Bluey: Dad! (rides her scooter offscreen)
Bingo: Can I have a piggyback?
Bandit: No, you can walk yourself. We're only going up to the river and back.
Bingo: Aw, that's too far.
Bandit: It's not too far.
Bingo: Why do we have to walk? Why can't we just drive?
Chilli: Because it's good exercise.
Bandit: Tell you what, when your legs really can't go any further, I'll give you a piggy back.
Bingo: Okay.
Bluey rides her scooter back to the family.
Bluey: Come on, Bingo, let's race!

Bluey: Hey, finish line, come back!
Bingo: (giggles) Wait, finish line.
Bluey: Go, Bingo.
Bandit starts running out of breath and beings to slow down. He continues to say "Finish line" tiredly. The girls eventually pass Bandit.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray! (they get off their scooters) We win! (they giggle)
Bandit: (pants) That's good exercise. Come on, let's keep going.
Bluey gets on her scooter and rides away.
Bingo: Can I have a piggyback yet?
Bandit: Well, can you walk another step?
Bingo: No, I can't walk another step.
Bluey: (offscreen) Hey Bingo, look at this.
Bingo: Okay.

Bluey: It's an itchity grub family.
Bingo: Ooh, hello, itchity grubs.
Bluey: They're out for a walk.
Bingo: I wonder if their legs get tired from walking too.
Indistinct talking can be heard in the background.
Bluey: Oh no.
The camera zooms out to reveal a mother with a stroller is on the footpath walking towards the girls and itchity grubs. The mother is listening to her phone.
Bingo: The little itchities will be hurt.
Bluey gasps.
Bingo: Excuse me, look out for the little itchity grubs.

Bingo: I did it.
Chilli: Good girl, Bingo.
Bingo: (singing happily) Doot-do-do-do-do-do-do.
Bandit: Bingo, are your legs still tired?
Bingo stops walking and opens her eyes wide. Her face then becomes gloomy.
Bingo: Aww, yes.
Bandit: Aw, bummer. I wanted to give some of those pine cones to your mum.
Bingo: Ooh, I'll get 'em!
Bingo runs ahead of Bandit and Chilli, leaving them behind. When she gets to the pine cones, Bluey can be seen hitting a tree with a stick.
Bluey: Hey Bingo, give me a hand.
Bingo: Two seconds.

Chilli: Well, how about we play chariots? (she picks up a palm branch and wraps it around Bingo's scooter while she holds the two ends of the branch)

Chilli: Oh, Bingo...
Bingo: I need a piggyback!
Chilli: You know what I've noticed?
Bingo: What have you noticed?
Chilli: I've noticed that your legs don't get as tired when you're having fun.
Bingo: Ooh! (lifts her legs) Can I notice that too?
Chilli: Sure can. Watch. Gingerbread Man!
