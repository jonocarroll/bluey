Script
The episode opens in Pat's back yard. Over the fence, the Heelers' house can be seen with Christmas decorations up. Bingo tries to do a handstand, while Lucky runs back and forth on a backyard cricket pitch, counting runs.
Lucky: "Forty-eight... forty-nine... fifty! Woo!"
Bluey enters with a red tennis ball, and Lucky takes his place by the stumps, ready to hit. She bowls.
Bluey: "Hup!"
Lucky hits the ball over Bluey's head.
Bluey: "Whuh!"
She turns to get the ball, which has landed behind her. As she walks up to it, she accidentally kicks it. Faint piano music starts to play.
Bluey: "Ugh."
Bluey notices the piano music.
Bluey: "Huh? Whoah, Bingo!"
Bingo completes her handstand.
Bingo: "Huh?"
Bingo gasps and stands upright.
Bingo: "Music!"
Bluey and Bingo run inside, squealing.
Lucky: "Hey, bowler!"
Lucky rolls his eyes, then drops the cricket bat and follows them.
Cut to Pat's living room, decorated with a Christmas tree, cards hung from a string, a Santa-themed throw on the couch, and a drawing of a dinosaur in a santa hat. Pat and Chucky sit at a piano.
Pat: "You're getting the hang of it now, Chucky!"
Cut to an overhead shot of the piano keys. Pat and Chucky both play the melody of Jingle Bells with their right hands.
Pat: "Nice one!"
Cut to a shot of the living room from the back porch. Bluey and Bingo run up to watch, followed by Lucky a moment later. They finish playing. Chucky's tail wags.
Pat: "Ah, too good, Chucky! Well done!"
Bluey: "Woo-hoo!"
Pat and Chucky turn to look at Bluey, Bingo, and Lucky.
Pat: "Hey, squirts! Come and sing, you know the words!"
Bluey, Bingo, and Lucky run into the living room, laughing.
Pat: "You ready? Let's go a little faster."
Pat nudges Chucky with his elbow.
Chucky: "Okay."
Pat: "And a one, two, three, four!"
Pat and Chucky begin to play as all five sing.
All: ♫ "Jingle Bells, Batman smells" ♫
All: ♫ "Robin ran away!" ♫
All: ♫ "He lost his pants down in France" ♫
All: ♫ "And found them in Norway, hey!" ♫
The children giggle between verses.
All: ♫ "Jingle Bells, Batman smells" ♫
All: ♫ "Robin laid an egg!" ♫
All: ♫ "The Batmobile lost a wheel" ♫
All: ♫ "And the Joker got away!" ♫
Pat: "Woo-hoo!"
Pat breaks into a ragtime arrangement of Jingle Bells, as the children look on, astonished.
Pat: "Look out, kids! Whooaa, here we go!"
The kids start dancing.
Chucky: "Go, Dad!"
Pat: "Tell Santa to stand aside, Pat's comin' to town!"
Pat finishes. The kids cheer.
Pat: "The old man's still got it."
The ragtime arrangement of Jingle Bells plays over an end card showing the drawing of a dinosaur in a Santa hat and the message "Merry Christmas!"
