END TITLE CARD
The scene cuts to Bluey, Bingo and Muffin with Bandit, Stripe and a tree stump.
Bluey: (confused) What's Stumpfest?
Bandit: Well, we're gonna rip up this stump, and then, that stump.
Bluey, Bingo and Muffin: Ooh!
Stripe: Put on some tunes, you kids'll play...
Pat appears, climbing over his fence.
Pat: And the ladies watch us get all sweaty! Right, ladies?!
The scene cuts to Chilli and Trixie on the balcony, looking down on the event.
Chilli: You got it, Lucky's dad!
Chilli and Trixie cheer the boys on, to which they reply with another cheer. Bandit reveals his axe.
Bandit: Now, let's kick this off!
Bandit makes a mark in the stump with his axe. The girls run away screaming and laughing, finding another stump to hide behind.
Bingo: What do we play?
Bluey: Ooh, I know! Let's set up a nail salon on this stump.
Bingo and Muffin: Yeah!
Bluey: Dad! We're just gonna use this stump for our nail salon.
Bandit: That's fine, Bluey, but you've got 'til we've finished with this stump, okay?
Bluey: Okay!
In the background, Pat and Stripe are working on removing a stump.
Bandit: 'Cause then, we're gonna come and do that one.
Bluey: Yep.
Bandit: So, you understand that eventually, we're gonna come and rip up that stump.
Bluey: Yes, I got it!
Bandit: 'Cause it's Stumpfest, and that's a stump.
Bluey: Got it; Stumpfest.
The scene cuts to the stump that the girls plan to build a nail salon on.
Bluey: Okay, let's start the nail bar.
Bingo and Muffin: Hooray!
The girls set up their nail salon, painting and decorating the stump in the process.
Meanwhile, Pat and Stripe are playing around while Bandit works on removing a stump.
The scene then cuts to Chilli getting her nails painted by Bluey at the salon stump.
Chilli: Oh, great finish.
Trixie: Thanks, ladies.
Chilli: I told you this place was great.
Chilli and Trixie leave the salon as the walk back to the balcony.
Bluey: Come back soon!
Bingo: We need more customers.
Bluey turns to Bandit, seeing as him and the boys are the only ones around that haven't visited.
Bluey: Dad! Can you be our customer?
Bandit: Nah; stump.
The scene cuts to Pat and Stripe, who have almost removed the first stump.
Stripe: (to Pat) Oh, you've almost got it, you've almost got it!
Pat successfully lifts the stump, and the boys cheer in celebration. Chilli and Trixie cheer for the removal as well,
Bandit: Yes!
Stripe: Take that, stump!
Back at the salon stump, Bluey reconsiders her plan.
Bluey: (to Muffin) We'll just do your toenails.
Muffin: Okay!
Bluey: (as she paints) So, been up to much?
Muffin: No.
Bluey: Oh, that's very interesting.
Bandit, Stripe and Pat arrive, looking to remove the salon stump.
Bandit: Hi.
Bluey: Ooh, hello! Are you here to have your nails done?
Bandit: Well, no; we're not here to have our nails done.
Stripe: We're here for that stump.
Bandit: As I'm sure you are aware.
Bluey: (in shock) Excuse me? It's the first I've heard about all this.
Bandit: You guys need to move the beauty parlour so we can rip up that stump.
Bingo: It's not a beauty parlour; it's a nail salon.
Muffin: And it's our nail salon!
Bluey, Bingo and Muffin: Yeah!
Bandit: Bluey, I was pretty clear: you could use this stump for your nail bar for as long as it took us to rip up that stump.
Bluey: I don't remember agreeing to that!
Bandit: Well, I do. Now, come on. Vamoose!
The girls rush to protect their salon stump.
Bluey, Bingo and Muffin: No!
Bandit: Get outta the way!
Bluey: (to Bingo and Muffin) Everyone, link arms!
Bluey, Bingo and Muffin: Hmm!
Bluey: Save our stump!
Bluey, Bingo and Muffin: (chanting) Save our stump!
Bandit: Outta the way, kids!
The girls keep chanting as they block the boys' path.
Bandit: (yelling) Chilli!
The scene cuts to the ladies on the balcony.
Chilli: (joking) Oh, leave them alone!
Trixie nods to that statement.
Bandit, Stripe and Pat: What?!
Chilli: They're just trying to run a small business!
Trixie: Go and destroy the planet somewhere else!
Stripe: Destroy the planet?
Pat: It's a stump!
Chilli: Oh, leave that poor stump alone.
Bandit: You're the one who wanted it gone!
Chilli: (to Trixie) Oh, yeah, that's true; I want to put in a fish pond.
Trixie: Oh!
Chilli: (to the boys) Booooo!
Trixie: Save our stump!
Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, Chilli and Trixie: (chanting) Save our stump!
Bandit: Okay, the optics on this aren't good.
Stripe: We can take 'em!
Bandit: Nup, nup. Back up, fellas. Back up! (to the girls) Kids, let's calm this down. Is there anything we can do to settle this?
Bluey: Hmm... One second.
The girls huddle to figure out a negotiation.
Bluey: (whispering) What do you reckon?
Bingo: (whispering) They should be our customers.
Bluey: (to Bandit) Okay, we'll let you have the stump if you'll be our customers.
Bandit: You mean, you'd do our nails?
Bingo: Fingers and toes.
Bluey: And face make-up.
Bandit: Oh, man. The boys aren't gonna like this.
Bluey, Bingo and Muffin: (all giggling)
Stripe: Oh, man!
Pat: What?! No way! I don't wanna get my nails done!
Bandit: This is the best we're gonna get.
