The episode opens with a view of the Heeler home. A trio of Eurasian Tree Sparrows fly past. In the yellow living room, Bandit is lying on the couch, reading the newspaper.
Bandit: (sighs) Ahhh.
Bluey and Bingo stick their heads under the bottom of the newspaper.
Bluey and Bingo: Daaaaad!
Bandit: What do you hillbillies want?
Bluey and Bingo crawl up onto Bandit's stomach.
Bluey: (sadly) We want a pet.
Bandit: What? Pets end up taking over the place. I've already got you two animals for that.
Bandit rubs Bluey's head, she giggles.
Bluey: I can train it! Animals listen to me.
Bandit sits up with a grunt, dislodging the two kids.
Bingo: Please, can we have a pet?
Bandit: But you've already got one -- Shaun.
Bandit holds his hand up, holding his fingers and thumb together in a vague imitation of a bird's head, which he moves as though he was operating a sock puppet.
Bandit: (as Shaun) Marp!
Bluey: Aaaaah!
Bluey screams and jumps over the back of the couch, falling to the floor with a thud.
Bingo: (joyfully) Shaun!
Shaun: Marp!
TITLE CARD - Shaun
Bluey : This episode of Bluey is called Shaun.
Shaun: Marp!
Bingo: Hello, Shaun!
Shaun: Marp!
Bluey cautiously peeks out from behind the couch, then slowly creeps back to the front of the couch.
Bingo: It's good to see you again.
Shaun: Marp!
Bluey: (rolling her eyes) Daaad! We want a real pet.
Shaun pecks Bluey on the forehead.
Shaun: Marp!
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: Shaun doesn't like kids saying he isn't real.
Bingo: Oh, you're a cute emu, Shaun.
Shaun lowers his "neck" and Bingo pets it. Shaun nuzzles Bingo's face.
Shaun: Marp!
Bingo: (giggles) Shaun likes me.
Bluey: He doesn't like me.
Bandit: You just need to show him you're in charge. Watch. Shaun?
Shaun turns to look at Bandit.
Shaun: Marp!
Bandit: Sit.
Shaun repeatedly pecks Bandit in the face. Bluey and Bingo laugh
Bandit: Ow! Shaun! No!
Bandit holds Shaun back with his free hand.
Shaun: Marp! Marp!
Bandit: It's harder than it looks.
Bingo: Maybe he's just hungry.
Bluey: Yeah! Let's give him some food!
Cut to the kitchen. We see an establishing shot focusing on a box of cereal.
Shaun: (offscreen) Marp, marp, maaaarp!
Cut to the kitchen counter. Bingo has a handful of cereal, and Bluey has a handful of sunflower seeds. Bandit and Shaun are seated on the other side of the counter.
Shaun: Marp!
Bingo: Okay, try this, Shaun.
Shaun pecks at the cereal without "eating" any.
Marp, marp, marp!
Shaun knocks Bingo's hand away, scattering the cereal.
Shaun: Maaarp!
Bingo: Aah! Shaun! 
Bingo ducks out of frame to pick up cereal. Bluey comes forward, and offers Shaun the sunflower seeds.
Bluey: What about some sunflower seeds?
Shaun: Marp!
Shaun pecks at the sunflower seeds, picking them up in his "beak".
Shaun: Marp, marp, marp...
Bluey: It's working!
Shaun: Marp!
Shaun "spits" the seeds in Bluey's face.
Bluey: Aah! 
Bandit: Geez, he's a picky eater.
Cut to Bingo in front of the fridge.
Bingo: Maybe something from the fridge.
Shaun: Maaarp!
As soon as Bingo opens the fridge, Shaun lunges across the counter, dragging Bandit behind him.
Bluey: Bingo, noooo!
Shaun sticks his "head" in the fridge, and Bingo slams the door on it. Bandit continues to try to force the door closed, but Shaun won't budge.
Bluey: Bingo, noooo!
Bingo: (angrily) Shaun!
Bandit: He's eating everything!
Bingo: Get out of the fridge!
Bandit: Stop him, Bluey!
Bluey: Bad Shaun!
Bingo: (simultaneously) Shaun, no! Shaun!
Bandit: Oh, no! He's into the flan!
Bingo: Aah! Shaun, that's not how we eat!
Bluey and Bingo grab onto Bandit to help him pull Shaun out of the fridge.
All three: (grunt)
They finally extract Shaun from the fridge, falling over with a thud. Shaun emerges from the fridge, covered in sauce and holding a slice of pizza in his "beak".
All three: Phew!
Bingo: Oh, Shaun, look how dirty you are!
Bluey crosses her arms and scolds Shaun.
Bluey: Bad Shaun! Now you need a bath!
Bluey stomps her foot for emphasis. Shaun pecks her in the forehead again, getting food all over her face.
Shaun: Marp!
Bluey: Aah! 
The scene changes to an establishing shot of a bathroom door.
Shaun: (offscreen) Marp, marp, marp!
Water splashes.
Bluey: Daddy, still Shaun!
The scene changes to inside the bathroom. Bluey and Bingo are bathing Shaun in the sink. Shaun splashes Bluey in the face.
Shaun: Marp!
Bluey: Aah!
Bingo: (giggles)
Bluey: (laughing) I'm trying to get you clean, Shaun!
Bandit: Geez, emus hate being washed.
Shaun: Marp!
Shaun splashes Bluey in the face again.
Bluey: Aaah! That's it! Raaah!
Bluey grabs Shaun with both hands; they struggle for a second.
Bingo: Here, Bluey.
Bingo hands bluey a bottle of shampoo. Bluey squirts some on Shaun's face. Shaun begins to thrash around even harder, and Bluey struggles to keep her hands on him.
Bingo: Oh, no! You got shampoo in his eyes!
Shaun gets free. Everyone pauses for a beat. The scene cuts to the outside of the bathroom. Shaun busts out of the door and drags Bandit screaming down the hall.
Bandit: Aaah!
Bingo and Bluey chase them, laughing.
Bandit: Oh, no! He did not like that!
The scene changes to the green living room. Shaun charges into the scene and starts digging in a pile of pillows on the couch
Shaun: Maaarp! Marp!
Bluey: Sit!
Shaun throws a pillow on the floor.
Shaun: Marp!
Bluey: Sit!
Shaun: Marp!
Shaun throws a pillow across the room, landing at Chilli's feet.
Chilli: (gasps) My couch! What's going on here?!
Shaun's head pops up out of the pile of pillows, with another one held in his mouth.
Shaun: Marp!
Chilli: (rolling her eyes) Oh. Shaun's back.
Bluey: Mum, he's not listening to me.
Chilli: Oh, really? Shaun, sit.
Shaun goes quiet, drops the pillow, and sits.
Bingo: Wooow.
Bluey: Wow!
Chilli: Good Shaun.
Chilli pets Shaun's head.
Bluey: How did you do that?
Chilli: Just stay calm and controlled. (smugly) He's a simple creature, really.
Shaun pecks Chilli on the bum.
Shaun: Mmmarp!
Chilli: Ooh! Shaun!
Bandit: (laughing) Oh, you shouldn't have done that, Shaun.
Chilli: Shaun, that is not acceptable behavior.
Shaun: Maaarp!
Bandit: Wow, this emu just can't be tamed.
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Chilli: You know what this emu needs?
Bluey and Bingo: What?
Bandit: Yeah, what?
Chilli: (sing-song) Walkies!
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!
Bingo: Walkies!
Bluey and Bingo giggle as they run out of the room.
Bandit: Well played.
Cut to the front steps. Bluey has Shaun (and thus Bandit) on a pink leash with a rhinestone collar. Bingo and Chilli come out of the house behind them.
Chilli: Remember, Bluey, calm and controlled.
Bluey: Calm and controlled -- got it.
Shaun: Marp!
Shaun takes off at a run, dragging a screaming Bandit and Bluey out of frame behind him. Bingo laughs as she follows.
Chilli: Oh, dear.
The scene changes to the front of an unfamiliar house. Shaun drags Bandit and Bluey into frame, still screaming. Shaun sticks his head into the letterbox.
Bluey: Stop, Shaun! Stop!
Shaun: Maaarp!
Shaun whips his head around, scattering mail everywhere.
Bluey and Bingo: Nooo!
Bingo: Shaun, no!
Bluey: Look at this mess!
Shaun: Marp!
Bandit: This isn't going well, kids. I say we just turn around and go home.
Bluey: No. I can do this.
Bluey yanks on the leash, forcing Shaun to face her.
Bluey: Shaun, that is not acceptable behavior. Do you understand?
Bluey flinches, covering her face with her arms.
Shaun: Marp.
Bluey relaxes.
Bingo: He listened!
Bluey: Good boy, Shaun. That's more like it.
Pat walks into the frame.
Pat: Hey, Bandit. How ya goin'?
Shaun pounces on him, knocking him to the ground.
Bluey and Bingo: No!
Shaun: Marp marp marp!
Shaun pecks Pat in the ribs, as Pat laughs and screams.
Bluey: Shaun, get off him!
Bandit: Sorry, mate! He doesn't like dogs!
Bluey: Get off Lucky's Dad!
Pat: Janeeeelle! Shaun's back!
Bandit: (whispering) Go limp! Go limp!
Shaun: Marp! Marp! Marp!
We hear a screech, and Shaun's head snaps up, focused on something offscreen. We pan over to see: an Australian white ibis. Shaun and Bandit take off in hot pursuit.
Bluey: (screaming) He's chasing the bin chicken!
The camera follows Shaun and Bandit chasing the bin chicken, with Bluey and Bingo trailing behind.
Shaun: Marp! Marp! Marp!
Bin Chicken: (squawk)
Bluey: Shaun, come back!
Bingo and Bluey: Shaun, no!
Bandit: He's heading for the prickle bush!
Bingo: He'll get prickles! Pleeease make him stop, Bluey!
Bingo and Bluey stop running.
Bluey: Okay. Calm and controlled. Shaun, stop.
Shaun: Marp!
Shaun stops just shy of the prickle bush. The bin chicken makes a right turn and gets away.
Bingo: (gasps) He stopped!
Bandit: Whoa.
Bluey: Come.
Shaun and Bandit calmly walk over.
Bingo: He came!
Bluey: Sit.
Shaun and Bandit sit.
Bingo: He sat!
Bluey pats Shaun on the head.
Bluey: Good boy, Shaun.
Shaun: Marp!
Bingo: Woooow! You did it, Bluey.
Bluey: Calm and controlled. Now, walkies.
Shaun: Marp!
The scene changes, the three are now in a park.
Bluey: Sit.
Shaun: Marp!
Shaun and Bandit sit. Bluey removes Shaun's collar, and points out into the park.
Bluey: Go!
Shaun and Bandit run around erratically.
Shaun: Marp, marp, marp, marp, marp, marp, marp!
Cut to an elephant slide. Shaun and Bandit slide down the slide while Bingo giggles.
Shaun: Maaaarp!
Cut to a different part of the park. Bluey is chasing Shaun, and tags him.
Shaun: Marp!
Bluey: You're it! (screams)
Shaun chases Bluey, but Bandit is panting and can only make it a few steps. Shaun turns around and starts pecking at his face.
Shaun: Marp, marp, marp, marp, marp, marp!
Bandit sighs and resumes the chase.
Cut to another part of the park. Bandit looks worn out and his chest is heaving. Bingo is holding a stick.
Bingo: Ready? Fetch!
Bingo throws the stick, and Shaun and Bandit run after it. They return after a moment, Bandit panting.
Shaun: Marp!
Yet another part of the park. Shaun is giving Missy an emu ride.
Missy: (laughs)
Shaun: Marp! Marp!
Shaun returns to a line of kids. Missy jumps off and Winton takes her place.
Shaun: Marp!
Bluey: Here ya go!
Shaun and Bandit set off at a walk. Bandit looks miserable.
Bluey: Next!
Cut back to Bingo and Shaun playing fetch. Bandit's chest is still heaving.
Bingo: Ready?
Shaun: Marp!
Bingo fakes a throw.
Bingo: Go get it!
Shaun: Marp!
Shaun stops after a few steps, looking around in confusion. Bingo laughs.
Shaun: Marp! Marp!
Cut back to the house. Shaun is picking up mail and putting it back in the box.
Shaun: Marp! Maaarp! Marp!
Cut to the Heelers' front lawn. Pat is petting Shaun, who is back on the leash.
Pat: No hard feelings, mate.
Shaun: Marp!
Cut to Chilli and Bandit's bedroom. Shaun walks in with an exhausted Bandit.
Shaun: Marp!
Bluey: Up!
Bandit and Shaun get up on the bed.
Bluey: Lie down.
Bandit lies down. Shaun keeps his head up.
Bluey: Good boy. Sleepy time now.
Shaun: Maaarp.
Bluey and Bingo walk up next to Shaun. Bluey starts to pet Shaun's head as they sing.
Bluey and Bingo: (singing) Go to sleep, go to sleep / Go to sleep, little emu / In the morning, in the morning / We will do it again
Shaun: Marp!
Shaun goes limp. Bandit immediately begins to snore. Bluey and Bingo laugh.
A brief cutaway shot of the sun setting behind the Heeler house, with birds flying past. Then we return to the bedroom, with much brighter light. Bandit hasn't moved. Chilli walks in.
Bandit: (yawning) Oh, man. Is it morning?
Chilli: Yep!
Bandit: (concerned) Where's Shaun?
Chilli: Well, while you were asleep, Shaun left for a long holiday to the bush to see his friends.
Bandit examines his hand, and wiggles his fingers.
Bandit: Oh. Well, good for him.
Chilli: Yes, but...
Bandit: What?
Four emu-hands pop up from the edge of the bed. These belong to Bluey and Bingo.
Bluey and Bingo: (as emus) Marp! Marp, marp marp...
Bandit: Aaah!
Bandit flinches and covers his face. The emus continue to marp.
Chilli: He's had babies!
Bandit: Oh, no!
Emus: Maaarp!
All four emus peck Bandit in the stomach simultaneously.
Emus: Marp!
Bandit: Oww!
The credits music is the episode theme "Shaun". Chilli laughs over the first few seconds, and then emus marp over the rest of it.
