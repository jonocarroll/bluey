Bluey: She's here!
Bluey: Hooray, Muffin's here! Mum, you remember your promise?
Chilli: Yes I do. Because it's a special night and Cousin Muffin's sleeping over, you get to stay up a little later.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray! (chanting) Stay up late! Stay up late!
Bluey: Muffin, we're gonna stay up...
Muffin: Coconuts have water in them! (roars)
Bluey: Whoa! What's up with you Muffin?
Chilli: Oh boy, I think Muffin's skipped a sleep.
Muffin: I am a llama! Eating a banana! Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!
Bluey: Did she say she's a llama?

END TITLE CARD
Muffin: (pointing at doorstop, exhausted) You stop doors, doorstop. (giggles as she lifts it, Chilli has to hold the door open)
Bluey: What's going on, Uncle Stripe?
Stripe: (goes down his knee on his nieces' level) Remember when you dudes were younger, and you used to have a little sleep during the day?
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah.
Stripe: Well, as you got older, you stopped having that little sleep, didn't you?
Bluey: Yeah, now we just sleep once.
Bingo: Yeah, at night.
Stripe: Well, Muffin is right in the middle of stopping that second little sleep during the day.
Bluey and Bingo: Oh.
Stripe: Ow!
Muffin: Daddy-stop!
Stripe: (chuckles as he removes the doorstop and stands up) Okay, Muffin. Early bed for you.
Bluey: Wait, no. We get to stay up late, though.
Stripe: Uh... well... Gotta run! (laughs nervously)
Bandit: Hey, Muffin!
Bandit: Ow!
Muffin: Coconut!
Bluey: Mum, you promised we could stay up late!
Chilli: I know I did. But we have to do the right thing by Muffin. (picks up Muffin and puts her feet on the floor. Muffin then runs again normally) She skipped her sleep.
Bluey: But you promised!
Chilli: One game, then bed.
Bluey and Bingo: (disappointed) Ooh!
Meanwhile, Muffin returns to her cousins' side with an...
Muffin: Inflatable guitar! ("plays" with it)
Bluey: Oh, I know! Let's make it a very long game, so we have to stay up late to finish it!
Bingo: Yes!
Bluey: (to her mum) Okay. One game, then bed.
Chilli: Great. Now, which game?
Bluey and Bingo: "Restaurant"!
Bluey: So, husband and Sheila, should we have a nice, slow, dinner at the restaurant?
Bingo: Sure thing, babe.
Chilli: Good evening. Welcome to our restaurant, known for its speedy service. How many will be dining tonight?
Bluey: Three.
Chilli: Very good. One, two.... Where's the other one?
Bluey and Bingo: Yaaah! Wake up, Sheila!
Muffin: My name is Bububabu!
Chilli: Bububabu needs to go to bed.
Bluey: Uh, no she's fine! She just likes plants.
Muffin: I... hate... plaaant! 
Bluey and Bingo: Aaaah! 
Bingo: Get it together, Sheila!
Bluey: We are ready.
Muffin: Choo-Choo!
Muffin: Brmmm! Ding! Next stop, the museum!
Bluey: Sheila, this isn't a bus.
Chilli: Here are the menus.
Bluey: Yes, just warning you. I think we'll take a long time deciding.
Chilli: No you won't.
Bingo: Oh, it all looks so good, babe.
Muffin: Coconuts have water in them.
Bluey: Sheila, what are you doing?
Bingo: Let her go!
[Then Muffin jumps on the table, laughing hysterically as she shakes around on it. Bluey and Bingo look at each other rather awkwardly.
Chilli: My restaurant!
Bluey: Ahh! This doesn't mean the we're finished!
Chilli: Bluey.
Bluey: Maybe we'll just go to the chip shop. Come on, family.
Muffin: Chippies!
Bandit: Chips! Get your chips, here! (Looks at the kids) Oh, hello. Would you like some chip--
Bandit: Hey!
Muffin: Chippies!
Bandit: Who-o-a! Okay, okay! Please, madam, don't shake my shop!
Bluey: (pulls Muffin off) We'd love some chips, please, and take your time.
Bandit: Your friend looks like she should be in bed.
Bluey: Oh, no, she's fine.
Bandit: Well, that'll be 4 dollarbucks, please.
Bluey: If we pay him, the game's finished.
Bingo: What are we gonna do babe?
Bluey: I know! Run, Sheila!
Muffin: Okay! Raaah!
Bandit: Hey! Stop! Thief!
Bluey: The game's still going!
Bingo: That's great, babe.
Bandit: Police!
Chilli: Did someone call the police?
Bandit: Yes she went that way!
Chilli: Stop! Police!
Muffin: Ride, flamingo, riiide! Raah-raah-raah-raah-rararaah!
Bluey: Whoa, Muffin. You really are tired.
Muffin: Arrahlahalba!
Chilli: Freeze!
Bluey, Bingo, and Muffin: Aah!
Chilli: Thank you for your time, sir.
Bandit: I want you to throw the book at her! 
Chilli: Now, listen up. If friend buys chippies, she has to pay for chippies.
Bluey: Yes police lady.
Bingo: Sorry, police lady.
Chilli: Okay, girls, bedtime.
Bluey: Oh, it's not fair. You said we could stay up late.
Chilli: Bluey it is late. Look! It's eight-o-clock.
Bluey and Bingo: We stayed up late! Hooray!
Chilli: No hooray, Bluey. If your cousin has skipped a sleep, it's up to you to look after her. Muffin should have have been in bed long ago. Look at her. 
Muffin: Bad cop!
All: Sheila!
Bluey: Come back!
Chilli: This doesn't mean the game is still going!
Muffin: I'm coming, flamingo! 
Bluey: You okay, Muffin?
Muffin: I'm the flamingo king queeen! 
Bingo: Bluey, this means the game is still going! Come on, let's stay up even later!
Bluey: No Bingo, do what I do. Ah, Sheila look! The police lady is coming. Follow me! You won't catch us police lady!
Chilli: Bluey!
[Bluey winks at Chilli. Eventually, Chilli understands what Bluey is up to.
Chilli: I'm gonna catch you!
Bluey: Hide under here, Sheila.
Muffin: Okay, Bluey.
Bluey: They'll never find you here.
Muffin: Thanks, Bluey.
Bluey: Now stay quiet. I'll check if the coast is clear.
Chilli: Good work, Bluey.
Muffin: Morning, Bluey!
Bluey: Ohh! I'm so tired.
Muffin: Maybe you should go to bed earlier.
Bluey: Yeah, probably, Muffin.
Muffin: Bluey.
Bluey: Yes, Muffin?
Muffin: Why is there a flamingo in my sleeping bag? 
Bluey: It's a long story.
