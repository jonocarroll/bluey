The episode starts with a view of the Heelers' front door from inside. The doorbell rings and Bluey and Bingo quickly rush to the door with Chilli coming up from behind.
Bingo: She's here!
Bluey: Hooray, Muffin's here! (points to Chilli). Mum, you remember your promise?
Chilli: Yes, I do. Because it's a special night and Cousin Muffin's sleeping over, you get to stay up a little later.
Both Bluey and Bingo wag their tails. Obviously excited that they will stay up late.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray! (chanting) Stay up late! Stay up late!
Bluey opens the front door.
Bluey: Muffin, we're gonna stay-
Muffin runs into the hallway screaming and grabs Bluey's arms. Bluey yelps in shock.
Muffin: Coconuts have water in them! (Yells) Hu-wa-waa-RAAA!!!
Bluey: Whoa! What's up with you Muffin?
Chilli: Oh boy, I think Muffin's skipped a sleep!
A nervous Stripe walks in.
Muffin: I am a llama! Eating a banana! Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!
Bluey: Did she say she's a llama?
Bluey: (voiceover) This episode of Bluey is called The Sleepover.
The scene cuts to the outside house. The view is zoomed in on Muffin, still very sleepy and exhausted.
Muffin: (pointing at doorstop, exhausted) You stop doors, doorstop. 
She giggles at this as she lifts the door stopper, Chilli has to hold the door open. Muffin then drops the stopper on the porch.
Bluey: What's going on, Uncle Stripe?
Stripe: (goes down onto his knee on his nieces' level) Remember when you dudes were younger, and you used to have a little sleep during the day?
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah.
Stripe: Well, as you got older, you stopped having that little sleep, didn't you?
Bluey: Yeah, now we just sleep once.
Bingo: Yeah, at night.
Stripe: Well, Muffin is right in the middle of stopping that second little sleep during the day.
Bluey and Bingo: (Nodding) Ohhh.
Muffin runs over to Stripe carrying the doorstop while screaming and drops it on her dad's tail.
Stripe: Ow!
Muffin: Daddy-stop!
Stripe: (chuckles as he removes the doorstop and stands up) Okay, Muffin. Early bed for you.
Bluey: Wait, no. We get to stay up late, though. (Bingo nods in agreement).
Stripe: Uh... well... Gotta run! (laughs nervously)
Stripe runs out of the house and quickly drives off. Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli watch with Bingo and Chilli looking unimpressed while Bluey looks in confusion. Muffin groans while holding the doorstopper again. Bandit comes outside to greet Muffin.
Bandit: Hey, Muffin!
Muffin screams and throws doorstop on Bandit's foot.
Bandit: Ow!
Muffin: Coconut!
The scene returns to inside of the house. Muffin runs down the hall screaming and crashes into an umbrella stand. She laughs and continues the running motion with her back on her floor. Bluey's family walk in.
Bluey: Mum, you promised we could stay up late!
Chilli: I know I did. But we have to do the right thing by Muffin. (picks up Muffin and puts her feet on the floor. Muffin then runs again normally) She skipped her sleep.
Muffin crashes into some blocks off screen. Screaming again.
Bluey: But you promised!
Chilli: One game, then bed.
Bluey and Bingo: (disappointed) Ooh!
Meanwhile, Muffin returns to her cousins' side with an...
Muffin: Inflatable guitar! ("plays" with it)
Bluey: Oh, I know! Let's make it a very long game, so we have to stay up late to finish it!
Bingo: Yeah!
Muffin: BEE BOOOO!! (mimicking playing the guitar)
Bluey: (to Chilli) Okay. One game, then bed.
Chilli: Great. Now, which game?
Bluey and Bingo: "Restaurant"!
Muffin bites into the guitar, popping it, surprising everyone.
The scene now changes to the back of the veranda as the kids walk towards the playroom. Bluey and Bingo act as wife and husband respectively whereas Muffin acts as their kid Sheila, who tiredly knocks into a pot plant as she makes her way.
Bluey: So, husband and Sheila, should we have a nice, slow, dinner at the restaurant?
Bingo: Sure thing, babe.
Chilli: Good evening. Welcome to our restaurant, known for its speedy service. How many will be dining tonight?
Bluey: Three.
Chilli: Very good. One, two...where's the other one?
The view is expanded to show Muffin sleeping while snoring on a potted plant.
Bluey and Bingo: Gaaah! Wake up, Sheila!
Muffin: My name is Bububabu!
Chilli: Bububabu needs to go to bed.
Bluey: Uh, no she's fine! She just likes plants.
Muffin: UGGGGGGH! I-HATE-PLAAANTS!!! 
Bluey and Bingo: Aaaah! 
Bingo: Get it together, Sheila!
Eventually they have their cousin under control as they carry her back to the restaurant's front door
Bluey: We are ready.
Muffin: Choo-Choo!
Bluey and Bingo look at each other rather nervously.
The scene then cuts to inside the restaurant where Muffin makes bus noises. There are also stuffed animals at tables resembling customers at the restaurant.
Muffin: Brmmm! Ding! Next stop, the mus~eum!
Bluey: Sheila, this isn't a bus.
Chilli: Here are the menus.
Bluey: Yes, just warning you. I think we'll take a long time deciding.
Chilli: No, you won't.
Bingo: Oh, it all looks so good, babe.
Muffin bites the cloth on the table and carries it with her teeth. Bluey and Bingo scream.
Muffin walks up to a table, makes a beep, and then grabs a yellow stuffed bear with a pink bowtie. Then she looks at it in the eye as if to tell it something.
Muffin: Coconuts have water in them!
All sounds are echoed to reflect Muffin's state of mind as the camera switches from Muffin's to the toy's face. The scene returns to the overall scene and normal sound effects.
Bluey: Sheila, what are you doing?
They pull on the bear until it gets out of Muffin's hands.
Bingo: Let her go!
Then Muffin jumps on the table and body slams on it as all the plates, cups and silverware fly off. She turns over and starts laughing and screaming hysterically as she shakes around on it.
Muffin: 
Bluey and Bingo look at each other rather awkwardly.
Chilli comes with a plate, on is two slices of bread.
Chilli: My restaurant!
Bluey: Ahh! This doesn't mean we're finished!
Muffin can be seen briefly shutting her eyes on the table.
Chilli: Bluey.
Bluey: Maybe we'll just go to the chip shop. (Waves her arm) Come on, family.
Muffin: CHIPPIES!
Chilli looks at the camera, unimpressed. They walk out of the restaurant as the scene cuts to the chip shop with chip vendor Bandit.
Bandit: Chips! Get your chips, here! (Looks at the kids) Oh, hello. Would you like some chip--
Muffin grabs one of the poles of the sign and violently shakes the chip shop.
Bandit: Hey!
Muffin: CHIP-PIES! (still continues to aggressively shake the chip shop).
Bandit: Who-o-a! Okay, okay! Please, madam, don't shake my shop!
Bluey: (pulls Muffin off) We'd love some chips, please, and take your time.
Bandit: Your friend looks like she should be in bed.
Bluey: Oh, no, she's fine.
Bandit: Well, that'll be 4 dollar bucks, please.
Bluey: Ah! If we pay him, the game's finished.
Bingo: What are we gonna do babe?
Bluey: I know! Run, Sheila!
Muffin: OKAY! Raaah!
Bandit: Hey! Stop! Thief!
Bluey: The game's still going! (wags her tails)
Bingo: That's great, babe.
Bandit: Police!
The girls run off from the back porch, then the police (Chilli) comes over to the stand.
Chilli: Did someone call the police? (Tips her hat to Bandit)
Bandit: Yes, she went that way!
Chilli: Stop! Police!
The kids flee from the grown-ups. Muffin is seen screaming, but Bluey and Bingo are laughing while running. Muffin then spots a plastic flamingo. Intrigued, she drops her chips and jumps on it.
Muffin: Fly, flamingo, fllllly!!! Raah-raah-raah-raah-rararaah!
Bluey: Whoa, Muffin. You really are tired!
Muffin: Arrahlahalba!
Chilli: Freeze!
Bluey, Bingo, and Muffin: Aah!
The scene changes to Muffin sitting in the back seat of the toy car, modified to look like a police car. She is struggling to stay awake. The view then widens to show Bandit talking to Chilli while Bluey and Bingo sit on the porch, listening on their conversation.
Chilli: Thank you for your time, sir.
Bandit: I want you to throw the book at her! 
Chilli: Now, listen up. If friend buys chippies, she has to pay for chippies.
Bluey: Yes, police lady.
Bingo: Sorry, police lady.
Chilli: Okay, girls, bedtime.
Bluey: Oh, it's not fair. You said we could stay up late.
Chilli: Bluey it is late. Look! It's eight-o-clock.
Bluey and Bingo: We stayed up late! Hooray!
Chilli: No hooray, Bluey. If your cousin has skipped a sleep, it's up to you to look after her. Muffin should have been in bed long ago. Look at her. 
Muffin: Bad cop!
All: Sheila!
Bluey: Come back!
Bluey quickly runs to catch Muffin, Bingo giggles at this and does the same. Chilli however, is not amused and facepalms herself.
Chilli: This doesn't mean the game is still going!
Muffin: I'm coming, flamingo! 
Bluey: You okay, Muffin?
Muffin: I'm the flamingo queen! 
Bingo: Bluey, this means the game is still going! Come on, let's stay up even later!
Bluey takes a good look at her cousin who is struggling to stay awake and thinks for a while. She figures out a plan.
Bluey: No Bingo, do what I do. Ah, Sheila look! The police lady is coming. Follow me! You won't catch us police lady!
Chilli: Bluey!
Bluey winks at Chilli. Eventually, Chilli understands what Bluey is up to.
Chilli: I'm gonna catch you!
The girls run into the house and into Bluey and Bingo's bedroom.
Bluey: Hide under here, Sheila. (She lifts up Muffin's sleeping bag for her to hide underneath).
Muffin: Okay, Bluey.
Bluey: They'll never find you here.
Muffin: Thanks, Bluey.
Bluey: (She puts down the sleeping bag). Now stay quiet. I'll check if the coast is clear.
Chilli runs into the bedroom shouting then Bluey shushes her. Bluey motions Chilli and lifts up the sleeping bag, showing her that Muffin is fast asleep. Hugging the flamingo with her and she snores.
Chilli: (patting Bluey's head) Good work, Bluey.
The scene changes into the morning view of the house. Then cuts to Bluey's bed where we see her sleeping. Muffin is sitting on the foot of her bed, now completely normal. She wakes up her cousin by saying:
Muffin: Morning, Bluey!
Bluey: Ohh! I'm so tired.
Muffin: Maybe you should go to bed earlier.
Bluey: Yeah, probably, Muffin.
Muffin: Bluey.
Bluey: Yes, Muffin?
Muffin: Why is there a flamingo in my sleeping bag? 
Bluey: It's a long story.
