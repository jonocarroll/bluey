Bandit: Yes I am! Chilli!
Chilli: Come on, kiddos. You have to let your dad go to work.
Bluey and Bingo: Aww.
Bandit looks behind him as he is leaving, noticing his kids looking on sadly. He stops for a second.
Bandit: Sorry, kids. I really do have to go. 
A mother bird is leaving her babies in the nest. Bandit puts his laptop in his backpack and zips it up. Bluey exits the house.
Bluey: Dad...
Bandit: Yes, mate?
Bluey: I don't want you to leave.
Bandit: Come here, kid.
Bluey: I want you to stay and play with us.
Bandit: I know you do. I have to go do my job, though. And you have to do yours.
Bluey: What? I don't have a job.
Bandit: Yeah, you do.
Bluey: Really? What is it?
Bandit: Making up games.
Bluey: Oh.
Bandit: And making the bed, doing the dishes, and setting the table! But making up games is more important than you think.
Bluey: OK, dad. Bye, dad. 
Bingo: Bluey, I don't know what to play.
Bluey puts her hands on her sides and looks around. She notices a sandbox, a tennis ball, and a sprinkler.
Bluey: I know. Come with me. 
Bingo: I'll kink the hose. 
Bluey: Good one, Bingo. 
Bingo: What's going to happen? 
Bluey: I don't know. Ready?
Bingo: Yeah!
Bluey: Unkink! 
Chilli is weeding the garden, humming, when she hears Bluey and Bingo squealing and laughing. She looks over to see them bouncing on the trampoline, with water from the sprinkler squirting all around them.
Bingo: I know, we can be lettuce, and this is a big salad spinner.
Bluey: Yeah, getting washed! Ready to eat! 
Chilli: That looks like a fun game.
Bluey: Mum, come and have some salad for lunch. We know how much you like salad.
Chilli: Yeah, alright. Whoa! Who made up this game?
Bluey: Me!
Chilli: Nice job, Bluey!
