Script
The episode opens with Chilli and Bandit in the living room, feeling fatigued from last night’s New Year’s party.
Bandit: (groans) "Man."
Chilli: "I don't ever wanna leave this couch."
Bandit: "Where are the kids?"
Chilli: "They're on the phone to Muffin."
Bandit: (groans) "Happy New Year's."
Chilli: (exhales) "I do not have the energy for games today."
Bluey: "This way, customer!"
Bandit and Chilli open their eyes in shock.
Bandit: "Oh man."
Bluey and Bingo arrive to the living room. Bluey pushes a skateboard to Bandit.
Bluey: "This will be the most amazing trip you've ever been on!" (steps on Bandit's leg)
Bingo: "Or, I get my money back!"
Bluey: "On you get! Watch your step!"
Bingo crosses the skateboard and walks on Bandit's leg then on his back. Bandit groans in pain.
Bandit: "Hey! Ow! What's going on?"
Bluey: "Oh, yeah." (pretends rowing) "Dad, can you be our boat?"
Bandit: "Okay, can't your mum do it?"
Chilli: "Hey!"
Bluey: "You're already on the floor!"
Bandit: "Sorry, I haven't got any me today."
Bingo: "Are you sick?"
Bandit: "Uh, no, just um, uhh..."
Chilli: "Sleepy."
Bandit: "Yeah, sleepy! We went to bed a bit late last night."
Bluey: "Because you went to the New Year's party at Muffin's."
Bingo: "She saw you dancing on her barbecue table."
Chilli: "What? Why wasn't she asleep?"
Bingo: "She woke up when Uncle Stripe yelled, "Cannonball!" and jumped into the pool."
Bandit: "Ha. Classic Stripe."
Bluey: "Please can you be our boat?"
Bandit: (groans) "Chilli?"
Chilli: "You make a much better boat than me."
Bandit: (grumbles) "Fine. One boat game. Then you kids play by yourselves."
Bluey and Bingo: "Hooray!"
Chilli: "Enjoy!"
Bluey: "Oh, and, Mum, you're going to be the whale."
Chilli: "What?!"
Bandit laughs.
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Whale Watching."
