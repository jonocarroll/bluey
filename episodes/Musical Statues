Script
(The scene starts with Chilli opening the door with two bags, a grocery bag with loafs of bread, chips and celery and a training bag with a hockey stick. Bingo rushes to Bandit for a hug.)
Bingo: Dad! We're back!
(Bluey boredly groans as she crawls with her hands)
Chilli: Come on, Bluey. I have to get dinner started.
(Bluey sticks her legs to the door for a moment and goes back to the floor. Chilli pushes her a bit with her leg and closes the door.)
Bingo: Dad!
Bandit: (groans) Ooh.
(Bandit picks up Bingo and rests her in his arm)
Bandit: Hey, Bingo.
Bingo: Can you play Crazy Pillow with me?
(Bandit puts Bingo back down and ruffles her head as he is preparing (possibly broccoli powder) for his bottle for the run)
Bandit: I'd love to, kid, but I've been sitting down all day. I just need to go for a run.
Bingo (sad): Oh...
Bandit: I'll play with you after dinner, okay?
Bingo: Yay!
(Chilli comes into the kitchen and opens the fridge door)
Chilli: No, we're having a bath after dinner.
Bingo: (sad again) Oh.
Bandit: Well, Crazy Pillow will have to wait for the weekend.
Bingo: Will there ever be a time when the weekend is forever?
(Bandit turns on the tap water for the bottle until he hears Bingo's question, confused)
Bandit: Um...
(Meanwhile, Chilli is thinking what they should have for dinner)
Chilli: Dinner? Dinner? What's for dinner?
(Bingo pops out)
Bingo: Cereal!
Chilli: You can't have cereal for dinner.
Bingo (pretty mad): Oh!
Chilli: I know. Meatballs.
(picks up a pack of raw meat(balls))
Bingo: Alright, meatballs.
(Bluey then appears out of nowhere below them)
Bluey: I don't want meatballs.
(Chilli squeals in surprise for a second)
Chilli: Bluey, you love meatballs.
(Bluey leans onto her other side, groaning)
Chilli: Well, then, what do you want?
Bluey: I don't know what I want but I know I want something!
(falls back to the floor again, Chilli turns to Bandit)
Chilli: I could use some help here.
(Bandit looks at Chilli while shaking his bottle)
Bandit: Babe, I HAVE to move my body.
Bingo: Like, you could call it a forever weekend.
Chilli: Spaghetti?
(Bluey groans in disagreement)
Bluey: No!
Bandit: See ya.
(As Bandit is about to head out, Chilli puts the pack back and slams the fridge door)
Chilli: That's it! Everyone stop.
Bluey and Bingo: Huh?
(Chilli points at Bandit)
Chilli: Including you!
Bandit: What?
(Chilli closes her eyes and crosses her arms)
Chilli: We're playing Musical Statues.
Bandit and Bluey: Oh.
Chilli (sarcastically): Hooray, Musical Statues!
Chilli (titlecard): This episode of Bluey is called: Musical Statues.
Bluey: I don't wanna play Musical Statues.
Bandit: Neither do I.
Chilli: Too bad, I need someone to do the music stopping.
(Both Bandit and Bluey groan and mutter in boredom, Bandit sits in a chair as Chilli does a cross body shoulder stretch for preparation, rolling her eyes)
Chilli: Oh. I can see where Bluey gets it.
Bandit: Okay, ready? Go.
(Taps on the phone and jaunty music begins to play)
Bandit: And stop. 
(Bandit taps the phone and again and points at Bingo, Chilli and Bluey each)
Bandit: You blinked. You blinked. You blinked. You're all out. See ya.
(He stands up from his chair about to go on his run, Bingo giggles)
Chilli: Come on, do it properly.
Bingo: Or don't do it at all.
(Bandit goes back to the chair and sits)
Bandit: Okay, okay.
(JAUNTY MUSIC PLAYS)
No. Give me that.
Let's put some real music on.
(DOO-WAP MUSIC PLAYS)
Alright!
That's what I'm talking about.
Get that body moving.
(GIGGLES)
Come on, Bluey. Shake it out.
Stop!
Whoop.
Mmm.
No-one.
OK. Here we go again.
(DOO-WAP MUSIC PLAYS)
Oh, yeah, shake it, Chilli.
Come on, Bluey. Copy my moves.
Yeah! That's it, Whoo!
Raise the roof!
ALL: Whoop-whoop, raise the roof!
Whoop-whoop!
Stop!
Whoop-whoop. Oop.
Bingo!
(GIGGLES)
You kept raising the roof!
Come on, kid.
Help me with the music.
OK. Go.
Whoo!
(DOO-WAP MUSIC PLAYS)
Bingo, if this was a dance-off,
who would you say is winning?
Mum. Definitely.
I agree. Come on, Bluey.
(GROANS)
Oh, Dad, I know. Play I Love Cereal.
Hold it right there, music fans.
We've just had a song request
come in from Ringo Heeler.
Bingo Heeler.
Who do you dedicate this song to,
Ringo?
It's for my sister, Bluey.
It's her favourite.
Well, alright, this one's going out
to Ringo's sister, Louey!
ALL: Bluey!
(TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS)
Ooh.
Ooh, look out.
Yeah, that did it.
Ooh!
Oh, yeah, go, Bluey!
Yeah!
(LAUGHS)
Stop!
BOTH: Argh!
Ooh, this is tough.
Sorry for the hold-up, folks.
We just have to check on
some Musical Statues.
Sit tight.
Mm.
Pretty frozen.
They're pretty frozen out there.
Mmm.
No-one's out.
And we're back on.
(TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS)
BOTH: Boop.
(GIGGLES)
Bingo, get outta there!
I can't!
(GIGGLES)
Oh, no!
Bingo's trapped in the boogieing!
It's a boogie trap!
How do I get out of the boogie trap?
I don't know!
Push stop.
Oh, good idea.
(SQUEALS AND GIGGLES)
Sorry again, dance fans.
A small child
was stuck in a boogie trap.
Alright, this is getting serious.
Oh, this song's intense.
Mum, you can pick up your game
a bit.
Oh, easy to say from the sidelines.
Yeah.
Whoa, you hear that, Bingo?
That sounded like a dance challenge.
Take the reins,
my honour is at stake.
(BREAK DANCE MUSIC)
Here we go.
Time to cut up a rug. Mm-mm.
Ooh, yeah.
Give it some of these ones.
Whoo-hoo!
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.
Whoo!
Stop!
Hmm.
(BLOWS)
Ah! (LAUGHS). Hey!
Mum!
Oh, ref. Come on.
Tell it walking, love.
Here, Bingo.
Let me put a song on.
Just this little blue one
to beat now.
(GIGGLES)
(FUNKY MUSIC PLAYS)
Oh, wow, OK, back to the glory days.
(GIGGLES)
Watch and learn, Bluey.
Time to take it to the floor.
(GRUNTS)
Dad, what are you doing?!
(GRUNTS) Oh, man.
Could use a rap mat.
Time to dust off the worm roll.
(GRUNTS) Live it!
(GIGGLES)
Oh, Bingo, now!
Stop!
What? Ooh.
ALL: Dad!
Oh, no fair. I was mid worm roll.
Bluey wins!
BOTH: Hooray!
Can we keep playing?
No, Bluey.
We'd better let Dad go for his run.
(GROANS) Nah, I'm cool.
This is actually better
than running.
OK, let's do it.
BOTH: Hooray.
Who's doing the music stopping?
ALL: Not me!
Oh. We all wanna dance.
What do we do?
Is there a way to play
where the music doesn't stop?
Oh. Let me check the rule book.
Hmm.
Oh, yeah, look.
It says,
"If it's been the sort of day where
you don't know what you want
"but you know you want something,
"then you can play Musical Statues
without stopping the music."
That's the sort of day we've had!
Sweet. We're good to go.
But how are you supposed to know
who wins?
Oh, yeah.
Um, oh, look, it's got different
rules written here.
Shall I read them?
ALL: Yeah.
"In this version of Musical
Statues, there's no winner or loser.
"It's not about getting to the end
"or getting to the weekend,
"or the forever weekend.
"It's a musical thing.
"You're just supposed to dance
while the music's being played."
(BOTH GIGGLE)
(SIGHS)
Oh, man.
I need a pillow.
(GIGGLES)
That was fun.
Do you think that's the thing
you wanted?
I think so.
(GIGGLES)
Oh, no, this is a crazy pillow!
Wait, Mum, what's for dinner?
Cereal!
(ALL CHEER)
