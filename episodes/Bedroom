The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler Family House, The sun is setting and it is getting dusky.
Cut inside the nursery room full of packed-up baby items and closed cardboard-boxes.
Chilli is holding up an open box over a sealed one. The open box contains a rattler with a blue baby bib decorated with a white heart in the middle; two multi-coloured sleeve-books; and one large brown teddy bear.
Bingo is examining an on-floor baby carousel which has been already boxed.
Bluey is strumming a ukulele.
Bandit enters the room heading towards the box-pile Chilli is holding up.
Chilli: That one can go.
Bandit: Yes, boss.
Bandit heaves up the box pile with a grunt and transports the items out of the room.
Chilli: Thanks, babe.
Chilli side-eyes at the baby crib before turning and leaning towards it. She continues brushing the railing in tiny motions. 
Bingo and Bluey take notice of this and walk next to her.
The view changes to show from the crib when Chilli sniffles and a single tear appears on her eye just as Bluey and Bingo arrive at the scene.
Bluey: Why are you crying?
Chilli wipes away the tear.
Chilli: Oh, it's just this room, sweetheart.
Bluey: How does a room make you cry?
The view changes back to show the whole nursery room.
Chilli steps away from the crib into the centre of the room.
Chilli: Well, I guess it's not the room: It's who's been in it.
Bluey: Ohh...
Chilli presents the baby crib.
Chilli: This was your first bed...
Bluey: Yeah. Then I moved into my room.
Chilli: ...And then it was Bingo's first bed...
Bluey: Then she moved into my room?
Chilli: ...And now it's no-one'sâ€¦
Chilli's eye tears up once again and her tail flops down.
Bluey looks in consoling manner and gently takes Chilli's paw into a hold.
Banit enters the room again and points at the crib.
Bandit: Alright, so we're dumping the cot?
Chilli looks at the crib again and cringes.
Chilli: (whimpering) Ouh!
Cut to the hallway outside the nursery room where Bluey is whispering into BIngo's ear.
Bluey: (hushed) Okay, okay. You're going to do the working- Bingo: (overlayed-whisper) No, you do it-
Chilli walks out of the nursery room holding a guide-book for baby raising: a wooden dumbbell; and a wooden bead bracelet.
Bingo: (whispering) She's here!
The pups step to position in the front the doorway of their own bedroom.
Bluey: Mum, what's this room going to be now?
Bluey points at the nursery room.
Chilli: It'll just be a spare room.
Bluey: Can it be my bedroom?
Chilli: What, you two want to change bedrooms?
Bluey: No-no, just me. I'll move into this room, and Bingo will stay in that room.
Bluey and Bingo point at their own bedroom.
Bingo: Then we'll each have our own bedroom.
Chilli: Well okay.
Bluey and Bingo: Hurray!
Chilli: As long as you're sure.
Bandit walks out of the new spare bedroom and continues walking down the hallway while dusting off his paws.
Bandit: Okay, done.
Chilli catches the attention to stop Bandit.
Chilli: Dad, can you move Bluey's bed into here, please?
Bandit: Oh, what?!
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called "Bedroom".
Cut the bedroom of the pups.
Bandit is attempting to wedge Bluey's bed past the doorway into the hallway.
Bandit: (grunting) Come on! You...
The view changes to a close-up focus on the pups.
Offscreen, sounds of thuds indicate Bandit manages to get the bed past the doorway and is now dragging the bed across the hallway.
Bluey: Bingo, can the watermelon rug go in my room?
Bingo: Um, okay. But can we have a rug race first?
Bluey: Yeah!
View changes to observe above over the watermelon rug from the doorway.
BIngo and Bluey set up for a (sprint) start.
Bingo: Ready-set-go!
The pups spring for the race clockwise around the rug while giggling and squealing.
Bluey stumbles a little and slightly falls behind but soon overtakes Bingo.
Bluey: I'm in the lead! I'm in the lead!
Bingo: Change!
Bingo turns around and begins to run the rug counterclockwise.
Bluey: Argh, no!
Bluey skids to halt falling on her paws but soon resumes chasing Bingo.
Cut to Bluey's new bedroom.
The items left from earlier are the armchair and the reading-lamp. The shelf now only has a potted plant.
Bandit is in the process of giving the one last nudge to set Bluey's bed against the wall.
Bandit: (grunts)
The bed jumps the last inch to be against the wall and Bandit loses his grip causing him to fall on his knee.
Bandit: Ouf.
Bluey backpedals into the room while dragging the watermelon rug.
Bandit: Okay, bed's in.
Bandit stands up to rub his bicep and roll the elbow of the same arm.
Bluey: Thanks, big fella.
Still rubbing the same bicep, Bandit begins to walk towards the doorway.
Bandit: Don't call me big fella.
Bingo rushes into the room, stopping Bandit on this path.
Bingo: Hey big fella, can you move my bed?
Bandit: Oh, man...
Cut to the now Bingo's bedroom.
Bandit is sitting on the floor grunting and is in a process to back-shove BIngo's bed towards the balcony window.
Bingo's bed soon slides the last half-a-metre against the outer wall.
Bandit: Phew.
Bandit stands up and begins to walk out the bedroom.
Bandit: Done.
Bandit rolls his elbow as he exits the scene to the left.
Bingo: Thanks, Dad.
Bingo climbs up on her bed.
Bluey enters Bingo's bedroom running and passing Bandit who is massaging his bicep now leaving the room.
Bluey: Hey, Bingo, you moved your bed to where mine was.
Bingo: Yeah, is that okay?
BIngo pats the mattress of her bed.
Bluey: Sure, that's fine.
Bingo: I did it so we can still watch Malcolm.
The pups climb up on Bingo's bed so that they can look out the window.
On the tree, there is a nest with a white-headed pigeon resting inside and seemingly unaware of the presence of the pups.
Bluey: Oh, yeah, good one. What's he doing?
Bingo: Not much.
Bluey:Come on, Malcolm, do something.
The pigeon ruffles a little after a moment..
Bluey and Bingo: Ooh, he heard us!
Cut back to the hallway between the bedrooms of the pups.
Bluey and Bingo have equally stuffed their doorways with plushies. 
Bluey: Okay, these teddies are all mine.
Bingo: And these are all mine.
Bluey: Yes, now. What about Gloria?
Bluey picks up Gloria.
Bingo: Yes, what about Gloria?
Bluey: She was a Christmas present to me from Grandad. But you didn't get a Christmas present from Grandad.
Bingo: 'Cause he forgot I was born.
Bluey: Yes, he forgot you were born.
Bingo: So you said, "It's okay, Bingo, she can be both of ours."
Bluey: Yes, that's right.
Bingo: So whose room should she go in?
Bluey: Hmm, she can go to yours.
Bingo smiles and takes Gloria.
Bingo: Thanks, Bluey. But how about she sleeps over at yours tonight?
Bluey: Oh, okay.
Bluey takes the plush back. Cut back to Bluey's new room, where Bluey is rocking Gloria while humming. She puts Gloria back in her crib. When Bluey heard Bingo call for her, she ran over to Bingo's room.
Bingo: Bluey! Who keeps Lampy?
Bluey: Oh, um, you can keep her.
Bingo: No, it's okay. You take Lampy.
Bluey: Thanks.
Bingo: But can we play Asleep Awake?
Bluey: Ooh, okay.
Bluey: A...sleep.
Bingo lays down and pretends to sleep, complete with fake snoring. Bluey turns Lampy on again.
Bluey: Awake!
Bingo: Ah!
 Bluey turns off the lamp again. Bingo lays back down and falls asleep again.
Bluey: Asleep.
Bingo pretends to snore. Bluey turns the lamp on again, and Bingo gets right back up.
Bluey: Awake.
Bingo: Ah!
They repeat this process a couple more times, with Bingo laying down and getting up again whenever the lamp is switched on or off.
Bluey: Asleep. Awake.
Bingo: Ah!
Bluey: Asleep. Awake. Asleep. Awake. Asleep. Awake.
A montage starts with Bluey continuing to decorate her new room, placing Lampy on a nightside table. Cut to Bingo's room, where she places Floppy on her bed. Later on, the Heeler family has dinner, where Bluey is telling everyone about something. Next, the Heeler pups have a bath, with Chilli washing Bingo's head. Bluey blows some bubbles, causing her and Bingo to giggle. Finally, it's bedtime, where Bandit herds Bluey and Bingo into their rooms.
Bandit: OK, kids, into bed. Come on. Big D's ready for knock-off. Hey, hey, hey, where you going?
Bluey was just about to go into Bingo's room, but Bandit stops her.
Bluey: Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Bingo: 'Night, Bluey.
Bluey: 'Night, Bingo.
They run towards each other and embrace in a warm hug.
Bingo: Sleep tight.
Bluey: You too.
Bingo: Don't let the bed bugs bite. Take care of Gloria. And Lampy.
Bandit doesn't seem amused that this emotional sisterly hug is taking a bit too long to wrap up.
Bluey: Yes, I will. And...
Bandit: Alright. Come on, come on.
Bandit forcibly seperates them and gets them to their rooms. Cut to a shot of the moon with a cloud slightly covering it. A fruit bat flies off towards the moon. Cut to Bluey's room, with Bluey getting ready to go to sleep. Chilli wnters the room.
Chilli: You all set, Bluey?
Bluey: Yep.
Chilli: Exciting!
Bluey: Hee-hee!
Chilli: 'Night.
Bluey: 'Night.
Bluey: Ooh, tell Bingo to say goodnight to Malcolm for me.
Chilli: OK.
Cut to Bingo's bedroom where Bandit is tucking Bingo in for bed.
Bandit: Night, Bingo.
Bandit gives Bingo a kiss on the head.
Bingo: Goodnight Daddy.
Bandit: Clear!
He puts his hands up and starts walking away.
Chilli:Bingo, Bluey wants you to say goodnight to Malcolm for her.
Bingo: Ooh, OK. Goodnight from Bluey, Malcolm.
Bingo went over to her bedroom window, looking out the window to see Malcolm, already asleep. Bluey pokes her head in from the hallway to talk to Bingo.
Bluey: Because he might be wondering where I am.
Chilli: OK, come on. Into bed. 'Night, Bingo.
Bingo: 'Night.
Cut back to Bluey's bedroom, where she climbs back into bed. Chilli pokes her head in.
Chilli: Now off to sleep, honey.
Bluey: OK, Mum.
Bluey tries to fall asleep, but finds herself unable to. She opens her eyes. Cut to the living room, where Bandit lays on the couch on his stomach. Chilli grabs a purple tablet and starts using it.
Bandit: Oh, yeah, couch.
Some footsteps could be heard from upstairs.
Bandit: Bags not!
Chilli: Bags not! Ah, biscuits.
Cut to Bingo's room, where Bingo is helping Bluey moves some books in a red wagon.
Bingo: Ooh, careful.
Chilli is at the door, watching them.
Chilli: What's going on?
Bluey: It's OK. Bingo said I can have them.
Chilli: It's bedtime, kids, come on. You should have done this earlier.
Bingo: But Bluey needs books.
Chilli: Ugh. Come on, hurry up. 
Chilli brings the wagon full of books into Bluey's room and leaves them there.
Chilli:There. Done. 'Night.
Bluey: 'Night!
Chilli walks out of the room. She enters the hallway, where Bingo is moving a bookcase towards Bluey's room.
Chilli: Bingo!
Bingo: It's OK, she can have it.
Cut back to Bluey's room, where Chilli is finishing setting up the bookcase.
Chilli: OK, that's the last thing. No more leaving your rooms, OK? It's bedtime.
Bingo runs out of the room, and Bluey stands at the door.
Bluey and Bingo: OK, Mama.
Bluey waves goodnight at Bingo, who returns the wave. They smile at first, but their smiles quickly fade. They go back into their bedrooms. Bluey tries to fall asleep again, but she suddenly wakes up.
Bluey: Ooh!
Bluey runs over to a stool with some drawing materials on it. She grabs a paper and some markers, then she gets on the floor and starts drawing. When she finishes, she slides over a folded paper over to Bingo's room. Bingo wakes up and checks the note: it's a drawing of a baby bottle with a question mark.
Bingo: Huh? Oh, yeah!
Bluey lays in bed awake, waiting for a response. After a few seconds, a baby bottle rolls into the room. She grabs it and feeds Gloria with it.
Bluey: Sorry, Gloria, I forgot your bottle.
Another message comes in from Bingo. She runs over and checks it: it's a picture of a red heart. Bluey smiles and wags her tail, running over to her drawing materials to add to it. After a few seconds, the message slides back into Bingo's room. She opens it: many pink hearts were added to her original message. Bingo smiles and wags her tail. Downstairs, Bandit is on his phone while Chilli is on a tablet. Some footsteps from upstairs could be heard again, alerting the parents.
Bandit: Bags not!
Chilli:Bags not! Arghh! Again.
Bandit: Hahaha, Too good.
Upstairs, Bingo is preparing to send a message to Bluey.
Bingo: Ehh... Eh! Arghh!
The message hits Chilli, who is not amused with her daughters still being up and sending messages to each other. Chilli walks into Bluey's room, where she is drawing another message for Bingo.
Chilli: What is going on here?
Bluey: I didn't leave the room.
Chilli: Well, no messages either. Come on, it's bedtime.
Bluey: OK.
Bluey begrudingly gets back into bed.
Chilli: Are you OK, sweetie?
Bluey: I'm just not sure I've got everything I need.
Cut to a zoomed-out shot of the entirety of Bluey's room.
Chilli: What? You've got your bed, you've got your books and the rug. You've even got the ladder. What else do you need?
Bluey looks away, then whispers something to Chilli.
Chilli: How about one last message?
Cut to Bingo's room, she's laying in bed, tucked in while holding Floppy.
Bingo: Goodnight, Missy. Goodnight, Lila. Goodnight, Grandpa Bob, wherever you are.
 A message suddenly slides into Bingo's room.
Bingo: Ooh.
Downstairs, Chilli returns and lays down on the couch again. Bandit is still on his phone.
Bandit: All good?
Chilli: All good, big fella. But you'll have to move Bluey's bed back in the morning.
Bandit: Oh, what? Does she miss her old room?
Chilli: No. It's not the room.
Cut to Bluey and Bandit laying together in Bluey's bed, Bluey having her hand around Bingo. 
The credits roll. Instead of Bluey dancing, a message slides in from the left.
