The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler Family House, The sun is setting and it is getting dusky.
Cut inside the nursery room full of packed-up baby items and closed cardboard-boxes.
Chilli is holding up an open box over a sealed one. The open box contains a rattler with a blue baby bib decorated with a white heart in the middle; two multi-coloured sleeve-books; and one large brown teddy bear.
Bingo is examining an on-floor baby carousel which has been already boxed.
Bluey is strumming a ukulele.
Bandit enters the room heading towards the box-pile Chilli is holding up.
Chilli: That one can go.
Bandit: Yes, boss.
Bandit heaves up the box pile with a grunt and transports the items out of the room.
Chilli: Thanks, babe.
Chilli side-eyes at the baby crib before turning and leaning towards it. She continues brushing the railing in tiny motions. Bingo and Bluey take notice of this and walk next to her.
The view changes to show from the crib when Chilli sniffles and a single tear appears on her eye just as Bluey and Bingo arrive at the scene.
Bluey: Why are you crying?
Chilli wipes away the tear.
Chilli: Oh, it's just this room, sweetheart.
Bluey: How does a room make you cry?
The view changes back to show the whole nursery room.
Chilli steps away from the crib into the centre of the room.
Chilli: Well, I guess it's not the room: It's who's been in it.
Bluey: Ohh...
Chilli presents the baby crib.
Chilli: This was your first bed...
Bluey: Yeah. Then I moved into my room.
Chilli: ...And then it was Bingo's first bed...
Bluey: Then she moved into my room?
Chilli: ...And now it's no-one'sâ€¦
Chilli's eye tears up once again and her tail flops down.
Bluey looks in consoling manner and gently takes Chilli's paw into a hold.
Bandit enters the room again and points at the crib.
Bandit: Alright, so we're dumping the cot?
Chilli looks at the crib again and cringes.
Chilli: (whimpering) Ouh!
Cut to the hallway outside the nursery room where Bluey is whispering into BIngo's ear.
Bluey: (hushed) Okay, okay. You're going to do the working- 
Bingo: (overlayed-whisper) No, you do it-
Chilli walks out of the nursery room holding a guide-book for baby raising: a wooden dumbbell; and a wooden bead bracelet.
Bingo: (whispering) She's here!
The pups step to position in the front the doorway of their own bedroom.
Bluey: Mum, what's this room going to be now?
Bluey points at the nursery room.
Chilli: It'll just be a spare room.
Bluey: Can it be my bedroom?
Chilli: What, you two want to change bedrooms?
Bluey: No-no, just me. I'll move into this room, and Bingo will stay in that room.
Bluey and Bingo point at their own bedroom.
Bingo: Then we'll each have our own bedroom.
Chilli: Well okay.
Bluey, Bingo: Hurray!
Chilli: As long as you're sure.
Bandit walks out of the new spare bedroom and continues walking down the hallway while dusting off his hands.
Bandit: Okay, done.
Chilli catches the attention to stop Bandit.
Chilli: Dad, can you move Bluey's bed into here, please?
Bandit: Oh, what?!
(voiceover) Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called "Bedroom".
Cut the bedroom of the pups.
Bandit is attempting to wedge Bluey's bed past the doorway into the hallway.
Bandit: (grunting) Come on! You...
The view changes to a close-up focus on the pups.
Offscreen, sounds of thuds indicate Bandit manages to get the bed past the doorway and is now dragging the bed across the hallway.
Bluey: Bingo, can the watermelon rug go in my room?
Bingo: Um, okay. But can we have a rug race first?
Bluey: Yeah!
View changes to observe above over the watermelon rug from the doorway.
BIngo and Bluey set up for a (sprint) start.
Bingo: Ready-set-go!
The pups spring for the race clockwise around the rug while giggling and squealing.
Bluey stumbles a little and slightly falls behind but soon overtakes Bingo.
Bluey: I'm in the lead! I'm in the lead!
Bingo: Change!
Bingo turns around and begins to run the rug counterclockwise.
Bluey: Argh, no!
Bluey skids to halt falling onto her hands but soon resumes chasing Bingo.
Cut to Bluey's new bedroom.
The items left from earlier are the armchair and the reading-lamp. The shelf now only has a potted plant.
Bandit is in the process of giving the one last nudge to set Bluey's bed against the wall.
Bandit: (grunts)
The bed jumps the last inch to be against the wall and Bandit loses his grip causing him to fall on his knee.
Bandit: Ouf.
Bluey backpedals into the room while dragging the watermelon rug.
Bandit: Okay, bed's in.
Bandit stands up to rub his bicep and roll the elbow of the same arm.
Bluey: Thanks, big fella.
Still rubbing the same bicep, Bandit begins to walk towards the doorway.
Bandit: Don't call me big fella.
Bingo rushes into the room, stopping Bandit on this path.
Bingo: Hey big fella, can you move my bed?
Bandit: Oh, man...
Cut to the now Bingo's bedroom.
Bandit is sitting on the floor grunting and is in a process to back-shove BIngo's bed towards the balcony window.
Bingo's bed soon slides the last half-a-metre against the outer wall.
Bandit: Phew.
Bandit stands up and begins to walk out the bedroom.
Bandit: Done.
Bandit rolls his elbow as he exits the scene to the left.
Bingo: Thanks, Dad.
Bingo climbs up on her bed.
Bluey enters Bingo's bedroom running and passing Bandit who is massaging his bicep now leaving the room.
Bluey: Hey, Bingo, you moved your bed to where mine was.
Bingo: Yeah, is that okay?
BIngo pats the mattress of her bed.
Bluey: Sure, that's fine.
Bingo: I did it so we can still watch Malcolm.
The pups climb up on Bingo's bed so that they can look out the window.
On the tree, there is a nest with a white-headed pigeon resting inside and seemingly unaware of the presence of the pups.
Bluey: Oh, yeah, good one. What's he doing?
Bingo: Not much.
Bluey:Come on, Malcolm, do something.
The pigeon ruffles a little after a moment..
Bluey and Bingo: Ooh, he heard us!
Cut back to the hallway between the bedrooms of the pups.
Bluey and Bingo have equally stuffed their doorways with plushies. 
Bluey: Okay, these teddies are all mine.
Bingo: And these are all mine.
Bluey: Yes, now: What about Gloria?
Bluey picks up Gloria.
Bingo: Yes, what about Gloria?
Bluey: She was a Christmas present to me from Grandad. But, you didn't get a Christmas present from Grandad.
Bingo: 'Cause he forgot I was born.
Bluey: Yes, he forgot you were born.
Bingo: So you said, "It's okay, Bingo: She can be both of ours."
Bluey: Yes, that's right.
Bingo: So, whose room should she go in?
Bluey: Hmm...she can go to yours.
Bingo happily takes Gloria into hold.
Bingo: Thanks, Bluey. But how about she sleeps over at yours tonight?
Bingo offers Gloria back to Bluey.
Bluey: Oh, okay.
Cut to Bluey's room.

Bingo: Who keeps Lampy?
Bingo points at their salt rock lamp.
Bluey: Oh, um...you can keep her.
Bingo: No, it's okay: You take Lampy.
Bluey: Thanks.
Bingo: But can we play Asleep-Awake?
Bluey: Ooh, okay.
Bluey: A...sleep.
Bingo lays down on the floor pretending to sleep and snoring deeply.
Bluey: (quickly) Awake!
Bluey turns Lampy on again.
Bingo: Ah!
Bingo wakes up and flings herself up on her feet looking very attentive.
Bluey: Asleep.
Bluey turns off the lamp again and Bingo lays back down and falls asleep once more managing to snore nasally.
Bluey: Awake.
Bluey flicks the lamp on again, and Bingo gets right back up.
Bingo: Ah!
Bluey shortens the time between Asleep and Awake for Bingo no longer being able to be fully awake or asleep but instead appears to be doing push-ups while loudly giggling.
Bluey: Asleep. Awake. 
Bingo: Ah!
Bluey: Asleep. Awake. Asleep. Awake. Asleep. Awake.
A musical montage with no vocals starts.

Bandit: Okay, kids, into bed.

Bandit: Come on, Big D's ready for knock-off.
Bluey is just about to go into Bingo's room before Bandit puts on his hand on Bluey's shoulder to halt her.
Bindit: Hey-hey-hey, where you going?
Still holding on Bluey, Bandit points at Bluey's room with his free hand.
Bluey: Oh yeah, I forgot.
Bluey scurries towards her room tittering. stopping at the doorway and turning towards Bingo's room.
Bingo: 'Night, Bluey.
Bluey: 'Night, Bingo.
Bluey and Bingo rush towards each other and embrace in a warm hug.
Bingo: Sleep tight.
Bluey: You too.
Bingo: Don't let the bedbugs bite. Take care of Gloria. And Lampy.
Bluey: Yes, I will. And...
Bandit, not being amused of this emotional sisterly hug taking too long to wrap up, forcibly separated the pups from each.
Bandit: Alright; come on, come on...
With a small squeal of amusement, Bluey and Bingo rush into their personal respective bedrooms.
A shot of a bat fluttering towards the Moon is shown,
