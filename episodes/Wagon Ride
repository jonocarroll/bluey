Script
The episode starts out early in the morning, stars are still seen in the sky. Bluey and Bingo are wide awake, and are on top of Bandit who is still asleep. He opens his eyes.
Bluey: Monkey bars? 
Bandit: Ugh, Chilli.
Chilli: Asleep. 
Bandit: Ugh, alright. Let's do this.
Bluey: Hooray! 
It cuts, Bandit is washing his face while Bluey cheers. Bingo is playing with Bandit's tail.
Bluey: Monkey bars! Monkey bars! 
Bingo: I know! Let's go in the wagon! 
Bluey: Yeah! 
Bandit: Oh, not the wagon. 
The title card appears, it's a red wagon with Bingo's doll, Jasmine, inside it.
Bluey (reading): This episode of Bluey is called 'Wagon Ride'. 
Bandit is holding the wagon out while Bluey sits inside it. Bingo walks out the house carrying Jasmine.
Bingo: Jasmine is coming, too. 
Bandit: The more the merrier. 
Bluey: Okay, let's go! 
Bandit: Seatbelts.
Bingo: Dad! There are no seatbelts! 
Bandit: Oh, yeah. Off we go. 
Bingo giggles as the three set off.
Bluey: First, I'm going to go across, and then back. Then, I'm going to do skip bar one way, and then double skip bar on the way back. 
Bingo: Oh, Jasmine. Your hair is so knotty. 
Rocko is out for a run, and greets Bandit.
Rocko: Morning, Bandit. Hey kids. Oh, you're up early. 
Bandit: Gotta be done. 
Bluey: Hey, why have we stopped? This isn't the monkey bars! Dad, come on. 
Bandit: Bluey, I'm talking. 
Rocko: I'll leave you guys to it. Bye, girls. 
Bandit: Oh, okay. See you, Rocko. Bluey, if I'm talking to another grown up, you don't interrupt like that. Okay? 
Bluey: Dad, I've got a plan. You're not allowed to stop the wagon and chat to your friends. You have to take us straight to the monkey bars. No stopping. 
Bandit: Hm. Interesting plan. I know, how about this plan. I'll do what I want, and you don't tell me what to do. 
Bluey: No, I don't like that plan. We'll stick with mine, thanks.
Bandit: Okay, no problem.
He hums, and turns the wagon around to head backwards, back to home.
Bluey: Wait, no! 
Bingo: Yeah! We're going home again. 
Bluey: Okay, your plan.
Bandit: Good decision. 
He starts walking back in the direction of the monkey bars.
Bluey: Ugh! 
Bandit: Okay, how about this. If I'm talking to a grown up, and you want me, you just come up and put your hand on my arm. 
Bluey puts her hand on Bandit's arm.
Bandit: So now I know that you want to talk to me. Then, I'll do this, to show you that I know you're there, and that you want to talk to me. 
Bandit puts his other hand on Bluey's hand.
Bandit: What do you think?
Bluey: Yeah! 
Bandit: Alright! High-five! 
He pretends to hold his arm out for a high-five, as Bluey tries to give him one, he pretends to have something in his eye.
Bluey: Hehe! Let's go! 
Bandit is seen pulling the wagon down the path.
Bluey: So then, after I do skip bar, I'm going to go upside down and be a fruit bat. 
Bingo: Oh, Jasmine. Is it really your birthday today? I'll have to get you something nice. 
Chloe's Mum: Morning Bandit, you're up early.
Bandit: Gotta be done. 
Bluey: Ugh.
Bandit: How's the little fella? 
Chloe's Mum: Yeah, he's good. He's just learning to roll over. 
Bandit: Oh wow, good boy. 
Chloe's Mum: Yeah, we're all stoked. 
Bluey puts her hand on Bandit's arm, Bandit puts his hand over hers.
Chloe's Mum: Hey, Bluey.
Bluey: Hi. 
Chloe's Mum: He keeps me up all night, Bandit. My word. 
Bandit: Yes, Bluey?
Bluey: Can you please finish talking now, so we can go to the monkey bars? 
Chloe's Mum: Oh, you're heading to the monkey bars? I better let you get back to it. Have fun, Bluey,
Chloe's Mum walks off.
Bluey: Thank you. Okay, let's go! 
Bandit: Now that was much better, Bluey. You didn't interrupt, you let me know you wanted to talk, and you waited till I was ready. Well done! 
Bluey: Thanks! 
Bandit: I still just need you to be more patient, though. Okay? 
Bluey: Okay. I just find it hard to be patient. 
Bandit: I'll give you a hint, next time, just watch what your sister does.
Bluey: Okay.
Bandit: High-five! 
Bluey tries to high-five him, he moves his hand away and scratches his neck.
Bandit: Ooh! Itchy neck! 
Bluey: Dad!
Bandit: Come on, Bingo. Let's roll. 
Bingo: Coming. Jasmine, I've got some birthday ferns. 
Bandit is walking the wagon down a hill, then across the road, and on the sidewalk. Mackenzie's Dad is riding his bike. He stops to greet Bandit.
Mackenzie's Dad: Morning, Bandit. G'day, kids. 
Bingo: Hi. 
Mackenzie's Dad: You're up early. 
Bandit: Gotta be done. 
Bingo gets out the wagon.
Bingo: Come with me, Jasmine. We need to get dressed for the party. 
Bluey: Ugh! Come on. 
Bluey is sitting in the back of the wagon waiting for Bandit to be finished talking to Mackenzie's Dad.
Bluey: Why is it taking so long? 
The music echos, Bluey remembers what Bandit said about watching what Bingo does.
Bingo: Jasmine, my dear. We really must get going. 
Bluey watches Bingo playing in a sunny patch of grass.
Bingo: Oh no! Our wagon has broken down. How are we going to get to the party? 
Bluey smiles, she looks at the bus arriving at the bus stop. She looks back at Bingo, she runs over.
Bluey: Hey Bingo, I know how you can get Jasmine to her party on time. Come with me! 
Bingo: Okay! 
A bird is on the bus stop sign, Bingo is sitting on the bench. Bingo barks as Bluey drags the wagon to the stop.
Bluey: Bus is stopping. This stop is the art gallery. 
Bingo gets off the bench, and onto the 'bus'.
Bluey: Don't forget to tap off! Please show me your ticket. 
Bingo grabs a leaf.
Bingo: Beep. 
Bluey: Thank you. 
Bingo: Can I sit wherever I want? 
Bluey: Yes, wherever you want. This bus is heading to the party place. 
Bingo giggles, as Bluey struggles with dragging the wagon with Bingo inside.
Bingo: Bye! 
The old lady sitting waves goodbye to Bingo.
Bluey: Bingo, you're heavy! 
Bingo: Again! Bus stop! 
Bluey: Yeah! 
Bandit: Alright, let's go, kids. We're almost there. 
Bluey: Oh, okay.
They cross a bridge with a river flowing under it. Bandit is laughing. The three are pretending there is a 'bridge troll' under the bridge.
Bluey: You won't get us today, bridge troll! 
Bandit: Yeah, bridge troll. Eat some other kids! 
They cross the bridge and arrive at the monkey bars.
Bandit: Right, we're here. The monkey bars. 
Bluey quickly crosses the monkey bars.
Bluey: Can you take us back to the bus stop, now? 
Bandit: What? We just got here! 
The bird is seen again, still on the bus stop sign. Bluey and Bingo are sitting on the bench.
Bluey: Oh my! This bus certainly is late. 
Bingo: Oh, yes. 
Bluey: I simply have to get home soon to feed my pets. 
Bingo: Here it is! 
Bluey: Oh, finally. 
Bandit pulls the wagon over.
Bandit: Pssh. Tickets, please. 
Bluey and Bingo get in the 'bus'.
Bandit: Anyone else? 
Bus Stop Dog: I'll get the next one, mate. 
Bluey: Off we go, bus driver. 
Bandit starts pulling the wagon.
Bandit: You ladies are certainly up early. 
Bluey: Oh, yes. It's got to be done. 
The episode ends, the credits roll.
