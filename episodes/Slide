The episode opens with an aerial view of the Heelers' front lawn. Bandit is just exiting the car. Bingo and Lila are playing paper-scissors-rock on the front steps.
Bingo, Lila: "Paper, scissors, rock."
Bingo throws scissors, Lila throws rock.
Lila: "I win."
She taps her rock sign on top of Bingos scissors sign, symbolically crushing it.
Bingo: "Lucky."
Bandit walks up to them, holding a large, colorful package.
Bandit: "It's your lucky day, kids. Look what I just bought."
Bingo: "What is it?"
He shows them the box. It's a plastic backyard water slide.
Bandit: "A water slide!"
Bingo, Lila: "HOORAY!"
The scene changes to a close-up of the lawn. The blades of grass are still dewy. A green, horned caterpillar climbs a blade of grass. Bandit's immense foot crashes down nearby; the vibration knocks the caterpillar off the blade of grass.
The scene changes to an aerial view of the back yard. The waterslide has been unrolled along the back of the yard. Lila waits by the waterslide as Bandit brings the hose. Bingo waits by the tap.
At the start of the slide, Bandit hooks up the hose. He gives her a thumbs-up.
Bandit: "Good to go, Lila."
Lila gives Bingo a thumbs-up.
Lila: "Good to go, Bingo."
Bingo turns on the tap.
Bingo: "Good to go, me."
Bingo giggles and runs to the slide. As she arrives, the water jets start to squirt.
Bandit: "Whoa! There you go."
Bingo and Lila squeal in anticipation. Their tails wag furiously.
Bandit: "Have fun, squirts."
The scene cuts back to the close-up of the lawn. The caterpillar is once again climbing the blade of grass. Bandit's huge foot crashes down, again knocking it from its perch.
TITLE CARD - Slide
Bingo: (voiceover) "This episode of Bluey is called: Slide."
Lila stands at the end of the waterslide, Bingo stands a few feet away from the start.
Bingo: "Watch me, Lila!"
Lila: "Okay."
Bingo takes a running start...
Bingo: "Whoo!"
...and leaps onto the waterslide. The scene cuts to a face-cam of Bingo sliding on her belly. She squeals in joy.
As Bingo slides, Lila runs to the start, watching Bingo go. The both laugh.
Lila takes a running jump...
Lila: "Yah! Whoo!"
... and lands in a sitting position. She spins as she slides.
Lila: "Whaa!"
The scene cuts to a face cam; she laughs as she spins.
She reaches the end of the slide, where Bingo is waiting.
Lila: "Whoo-hoo!"
Bingo: "We are the luckiest kids in the world!"
They run back around to the start.
Lila: "Let's go down together."
They clasp hands.
Bingo: "Ready?"
Lila: "Ready."
Bingo, Lila: "Let's gooo!"
They take a running leap, and slide on their bellies.
Bingo, Lila: "Whoo!"
They both laugh.
Bingo: "Oh, no! Stop! Stop!"
Bingo tries to brake with her free hand.
Lila: "What? Why?"
Bingo: "Just stop!"
Lila: "Okay."
They both use both hands to stop. They imitate squealing brakes.
Bingo, Lila: "Rrrrr!"
Lila: "Why did we stop?"
Bingo: "There's a leaf bug in the way."
Bingo points to a tiny walking leaf, slowly crossing the slide.
Lila: "Aw! She's so cute."
Bingo: "You have to be more careful, Leaficus."
Lila: "You're lucky we didn't squash you."
Bingo: "I'll move her off the slide."
Bingo fetches a twig from the lawn. She places it in the leaf bug's path, and it climbs on.
Bingo: "Come on, little fella."
The close-up shot of the lawn returns. The caterpillar crawls from one blade of grass to another. Behind it, a massive stick sets the leaf bug down.
Back at the regular scale, Bingo puts down her twig and gives Lila a thumbs-up.
Bingo: "Okay. You can go, Lila."
Lila: "Hooray!"
Lila takes a running start.
Bingo: "Bye, Leaficus."
Bingo waves goodbye to the leaf bug. She turns around, and spots a ladybird in the slide.
Bingo: "Ah, wait! STOP!"
Lila: "Hey, what?"
Lila already has one foot on the slide. She tries to stop but falls over backwards, sliding down the slide on her back.
Lila: "Whaa!"
Further down the slide, Lila coasts to a stop, just short of the insect.
Lila: "Ooh..."
Bingo crouches down to look at it.
Bingo: "It's a ladybird."
Lila: "Ooh, I love ladybirds. We can't squish them."
The scene cuts to a close-up of the ladybird. Bingo puts her index finger in front of it.
Bingo: "Come on, ladybird."
It climbs onto her finger. The scene goes back to regular scale, as Bingo stands up and puts it in the grass. Meanwhile, Lila turns over and spots an ant.
The scene cuts to a close-up of the ant. Lila's finger points at it.
Lila: "Hey. Now there's an ant on the slide."
The scene goes back to regular scale again.
Lila: "Bingo, can we squish ants?"
Bingo: "Well..." 
Bingo scratches the back of her head.
Bingo: "I don't like them as much as ladybirds, but I still don't think we should squish them."
A second ant wanders into frame.
Lila: "Me neither. Come on."
Lila puts down her finger in front of the ant. The ant turns the other way.
Lila: "Oh, there's another one."
Bingo: "What are we gonna do?"
Lila: "Ooh, I know."
The scene cuts back to a close-up of the grass. The caterpillar has almost reached the edge of the waterslide. With a rubbery noise, the edge of the slide moves out of frame.
Back at regular scale, Bingo and Lila are rolling up the edges of the waterslide.
Lila: "If we make walls, the little bugs won't be able to get over them."
Bingo: "Oh, yeah!"
Bingo giggles as they finish.
Lila: "There."
Bingo: "Lucky you're so smart, Lila."
Laughing, Bingo takes a running start and jumps onto the slide, sliding down on her bottom. Lila runs alongside her. Bingo howls.
Ahead of her, a grasshopper leaps onto the slide.
Bingo: "Ahh! Grasshoppers can fly?! I can't stop!"
Bingo shrieks. She manages to hop over the grasshopper. She reaches the end of the slide.
Bingo: "Whew. That was close."
Lila attempts to get the grasshopper to climb onto a stick.
Lila: "Yeah, grasshopper. You're lucky Bingo can fly too."
Bingo: "The walls aren't working. The bugs just fly over them."
The grasshopper suddenly flies away.
Lila, Bingo: "Ahh!"
Back at the close-up of the lawn, the caterpillar has one again reached the edge of the waterslide. It begins climbing the side.
Bingo and Lila stand at the start of the waterslide. Bingo looks a bit frustrated.
Lila: "Bingo, what if we just close our eyes and slide down?"
Bingo: "What would that do?"
Lila: "Well, we wouldn't see if we squished any bugs."
Bingo: "Mmm...I'm not sure about that."
Lila shrugs.
Lila: "Should we just try it?"
Bingo: "Okay."
Lila: "Here I come."
Bingo takes a running start. She drifts left, towards where Lila is standing.
Lila: "Bingo! Look out! Ahh!"
Bingo bowls over Lila.
Lila, Bingo: "Oof!"
They both giggle.
Bingo: "That didn't work."
Lila: "Well, lucky it didn't. Look!"
Lila points at an iridescent beetle on the slide.
Bingo: "Whoa. He's all rainbowy."
The shot briefly cuts back to the caterpillar, now climbing the side of the slide. When we cut back to Bingo and Lila, they're both sitting down at the start of the slide.
Lila: "I don't think we can waterslide at all."
Bingo: "This isn't fair, little bugs!"
Lila: "They can't understand you."
Bingo: "I know."
Lila: "We definitely can't squish them, can we?"
Bingo: "My nana squishes bugs."
Lila: "Mine, too.
Bingo: "But my mum doesn't."
Lila: "Neither does mine. She says they have a mummy and a daddy who would miss them."
Bingo: "But we can't just not slide."
Lila: "I think we're unlucky and it's the bugs that are lucky."
Bingo: "Can bugs be lucky?"
Lila: "Well, they're lucky my nana isn't here."
The caterpillar continues to crawl up the side of the slide. Bluey and Lila are now lying on their backs, looking up at the sky.
Lila: "Ooh, I know!"
Bingo: "What?"
Lila: "How about one person slides down slowly and checks for bugs? And if there was no bugs, she yells 'No bugs!' And then the other person can slide down."
Bingo: "Yeah! And pretend it's a job."
Lila: "Yeah! Bug inspector.
Bingo laughs.
Bingo: "Okay."
Lila: "I'll go first."
The shot cuts away to the tap. Water leaks from the hose connection. Back at the waterslide, Lila lies on her stomach, holding a small stick in each hand. Bingo gives her a push.
Bingo: "Off you go, bug inspector."
Lila slowly slides down the slide. She squints, looking closely for bugs. She spots a brown and blue spotted beetle.
Lila: "Oop. Bug."
She scoops it up with a twig. After a moment, the beetle flies off.
Lila: "Bug's gone!"
Bingo: "Good one bug inspector."
Lila reaches the end of the slide. She stands up, and holds her sticks aloft.
Lila: "Okay. No bugs. Go, Bingo! Quickly!"
Bingo: "Okay."
Bingo takes a running start, and leaps onto the slide.
Bingo: "Whoo!"
Bingo slides on her belly, squealing and giggling. She reaches the end of the slide.
Bingo: "Thanks, bug inspector."
Lila: "Your turn."
Lila hands Bingo the sticks.
The scene cuts to the caterpillar. It's now climbing down one of the slide walls. It loses its footing, and slides down onto the main slide. It shakes its head and resumes crawling forward.
Back at the start of the slide, Lila gives Bingo a push.
Lila: "And go! Hee-hee!"
Bingo slides slowly down the slide, sticks at the ready. She squints, looking carefully for bugs.
Bingo: "No bugs... Wait!"
She brakes with her hands.
Bingo: "Ooh, a caterpillar."
She comes to a stop.
Bingo: "Lila, come and see."
Lila gets down on her hands and knees to look.
Lila: "Wow. He's so beautiful."
Bingo: "You're lucky we have a bug inspector, Mister Caterpillar."
Bingo puts a stick in front of it. The caterpillar turns aside.
Lila: "Yeah. Or you..."
Bandit: (offscreen) MAKE WAY!
Bingo, Lila: "Huh?"
Bandit runs across the yard towards the start of the slide.
Bandit: "Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
Bingo: "Ah!"
Bingo, Lila: "Stop!"
Bandit discards his hat as he rounds the corner of the yard.
Bandit: "Can't stop the big blue guy!"
Bingo: "Dad! NOOO!"
Lila: "Move Mister Caterpillar!"
Bingo keeps moving the stick in front of the caterpillar. Lila waves it towards the stick. It continues to turn away.
Bingo: "I'm trying!"
Bandit: "Whoo! Yeah!"
With a ninja kick, Bandit enters the waterslide, sliding on his back.
Bandit: "Ho-ho!"
Lila: "Hurry up, Bingo!"
Bingo: "He's not getting on!"
The scene cuts to Bandit's bum, bearing down on them.
Bandit: "Yah-ha-ha!"
Bingo: "Quick! Grab the wall!"
They abandon the caterpillar and get off the slide.
Bandit: "Whoo-hoo!"
Bingo and Lila grab the side of the slide and start to pull it aside.
Bandit: "Hey. What? What are you doing?"
Bingo and Lila have pulled the end of the slide into a ninety-degree turn.
Bandit: "Ah!"
He goes right over the wall of the slide, then skids groin-first into a garden gnome—and then the bushes.
Bandit: "Ough!"
Bingo: "Phew!"
Oblivious, Mister Caterpillar continues crawling across the end of the slide.
Lila: "That was close."
Bandit: "What was that about?"
Bingo: (emphatically) "You have to wait for the bug inspector!"
Bandit: "I don't know that is."
Bingo sets down a leaf, which the caterpillar crawls onto. Bingo carries it over to an agapanthus.
Lila: "There you go, little fella."
The caterpillar crawls from Bingo's leaf to the agapanthus leaf.
Bingo: "Bye."
Bingo and Lila run off. The caterpillar crawls to the underside of the leaf, and hangs from its tail. In a time-lapse, it spins a cocoon and pupates. A butterfly with bright blue wings with black edges emerges. It flies upwards and vanishes into the sky.
The camera pans back down to Bingo's kindy. Bingo and Lila sit on the front steps, playing paper-scissors-rock.
Bingo, Lila: "Paper, scissors, rock."
Bingo throws paper, Lila throws rock. Bingo covers Lila's rock sign with her paper sign.
Bingo: "I win!"
Lila: "Oh, lucky!"
The blue butterfly lands on their clasped hands. Bingo and Lila gasp.
Bingo, Lila: (awed) "Whoa!"
The butterfly takes flight again. They watch it leave.
Bingo: "That's lucky."
The episode's "bug" theme, a sweet melody on recorder and strings, continues as the end credits play. Mister Caterpillar crawls across the screen from left to right.
