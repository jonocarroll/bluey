Script
Cut to the house, just inside the front door. Chilli moves Bluey and Bingo's delivery device out of the way, and they plan to head to the park.
Chilli: Come on, kids. We have to go. Quick sticks.
Bluey: Oh, why?
Chilli: We're meeting Judo at the park. If we don't get a move on, we'll be late.
Bluey: Oh, can we not go just yet?
Chilli: Why not?
Bluey: Just...because?
Chilli: That's not a reason. Now, where's your hat?
Bluey: I don't know.
Chilli: Well, find it. We're leaving in one minute.
Bingo: (stretches her arms out) Is one minute this long?
Chilli: (pushes her arms in) More like this long. Have you cleaned your teeth?
Bingo: Yeah.
Chilli: Show me.
Bingo opens her mouth to reveal teeth that definitely aren't clean.
Chilli: When did you clean them?
Bingo: Last night.
Chilli: Okay, go and clean your teeth.
Bingo: Aww!
Chilli: Go on. I'll time you. Ready, set, go!
Chilli imitates a clock and Bingo runs away only to be interrupted by Bluey.
Bluey: Bingo, package!
Bingo runs into Chilli.
Chilli: Ah! Hey! Bluey, hat. Bingo, teeth.
Bluey: I just need to deliver this.
Chilli: Deliver what?
Bingo: Sticky gecko!
Chilli: Oh, no.
Bingo throws the sticky gecko on the ceiling.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!

END TITLE CARD
Bingo: Come to mama, little Gecky.
Chilli: I'm still timing you, Bingo! (imitates clock)
Bingo: But I have to catch Gecky.
Bluey: You brush your teeth. I'll catch Gecky.
Bingo: Okay.
Chilli: No, you find your hat. I'll catch Gecky.
Bingo: (offscreen) Keep timing!
Chilli: (imitates clock)
Bluey: I can't find it.
Chilli: Have you looked?
Bluey: Yeah, I've looked everywhere.
Chilli: (groans and points to hat rack) There it is.
Bluey: Oh, yeah!
Chilli: Come on, Gecky.
Bluey: (looking at a photo of Granddad) What was it that Granddad used to say when he was a soldier?
Chilli: Hurry up and wait.
Bingo: (walks in holding a banana) Heehee! Hurry up and wait.
Chilli: Bingo, teeth!
Bingo: Oh, yeah! (runs off and throws banana to Chilli)
Bluey drops the hat rack, startling Chilli.
Chilli: Whoa!
Bluey: Sorry.
Chilli: Are you okay?
Bluey: Yeah, I'm okay.
Chilli: Good. Now, help me tidy this up.
Bluey: Oh, why do I have to help?
Chilli gives her a death glare.
Bluey: Ooh, okay.
Bingo: Aah! Who's catching Gecky?
Chilli: Uh, I am!
Bingo: My banana!
Bluey: I'll get it! Here it comes! (uses device to deliver banana to Bingo)
Bingo: (with a mouthful of toothpaste) Thanks, Bluey! (bites banana) Blah! Toothpaste-y!
Chilli: Okay, let's go. I need you out the door in one minute.
Bluey: Can I have my hat like Granddad's, with the side bit up like that?
Chilli: Oh, look, Bluey...
Bluey: Please?
Chilli: Okay. Go and get a badge, but hurry up!
Bluey: (knocks over hat rack again) Sorry!
Chilli: Ughhh!
Bingo: Time for rollerskates! (drops rollerskates)
Chilli: Aah!
Bingo: Mum, Gecky!
Chilli: Sorry! Come on, Gecky!
Bingo shows Chilli her now-clean teeth.
Chilli: (imitates clock) Stop! Woah, one minute. Well done! Now, let's get going.
Bingo: I'm just gonna put on my rollerskates.
Chilli: Bingo, there's no time!
Bingo: Aww!
Chilli: Oh, alright, let me put them on for you.
Bingo: No, you have to time me.
Chilli': Okay. Ready, set, go. (imitates clock)
Bingo: And we can't leave before Gecky falls off.
Chilli: Oh, look. I'm gonna give him a hand, alright?
Bluey: I found a badge!
Chilli: Great. Bluey, can you please grab me my hockey stick? I need to get Gecky down.
Bluey: Okay.
Bingo: The rabbit goes round the garden...nope, nope, try again.
Bluey brings in a squawking Chattermax.
Bluey: Look who I found!
Bingo: Chattermax!
Chilli: Bluey, hockey stick!
Bluey: I couldn't find it!
Chilli: Did you look? Oh, never mind. Give me that. I'll use Chattermax.
Chilli repeatedly hits Chattermax's head on the ceiling in an attempt to get Gecky down.
Chilli: Dammit! (removed in US version) Really stuck!
Bingo: Gecky doesn't like being rushed.
Chilli falls off the stool and Chattermax runs off. Bingo finishes tying her rollerskates.
Bingo: Finished!
Chilli: They're on the wrong feet, darl.
Bingo: Are they? I'll start again.
Chilli: Oh, Bingo, there's just no...(steps on badge) OW!
Bluey: Mum, have you seen my hat?
Chilli's stress level finally maxes out and she snaps on Bluey and Bingo. Having finally reached her limit, she slams the front door shut.
Chilli: Alright, that's it! We're not going to the park! We're just staying here, then!
Chilli aggressively flips through a magazine.
Bluey: So...we're not going anywhere?
Chilli: No, we'll just stay here forever!
Bluey: Oh.
Bluey sits on the floor and plays with Floppy. Chilli snaps again and flings the front door open.
Chilli: That's it! Come on! Out, out, out!
Bluey: I don't understand!
Chilli: We're leaving now!
Bluey: Okay, okay! I just have to find my hat.
Chilli: Ughhh! The door. It is right here. All we need to do is walk out of it. It's so easy.
Bluey: Why do we have to go right now?
Chilli: Because I don't wanna be late.
Bluey: But why?
Chilli: Because it's not nice to keep people waiting. Especially Judo's mum. She can get a little funny if you're not on time.
Bluey: Oh. Why?
Chilli: Well, I guess she thinks it's rude. But it just takes ages getting out of the house.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because you kids don't care about being on time.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because you're too busy having fun. In fact, that's why we're going to the park. Judo's been asking for a playdate for ages.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because you're a lovely little kid.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because I put a lot of work into making sure you're a lovely little kid.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because lovely little kids turn into lovely grownups. Like Judo's mum. She really is lovely, actually.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Well, when you were born, she made us five lasagnas.
Bluey: Mmm!
Chilli: It meant so much to me. That's the sort of person I want you to be.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because I want you to have a happy life.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because I love you!
Bluey: But why?
Chilli: Just...because!
Bluey and Bingo: That's not a reason!
Chilli: Oh, okay, you win! (embraces Bluey) So what's going on, Bluey? Why can't you get out the door?
Bluey: I'm just nervous about seeing Judo.
Chilli: I hear you. It's been a long time since you've seen her. Just be brave, okay? Like your granddad. (militaristic voice) Attention! Forward, march! Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!
Bingo: Stop!
Chilli: Huh? Oh, oh, oh! (imitates clock) Click!
Bingo: Was that one minute?
Chilli: Pretty much.
Bingo pumps her fist.
Chilli: You have no idea what a minute is, do you, sweetheart?
Bingo: Nope.
Chilli: Ahh, that must be nice. (phone goes off) It's Judo's mum. She's running late! Oh, well, take your time, kids.
Bingo: I'm hungry. (Chilli hands her a banana) Ooh, banana! (they both walk out the door)
Chilli picks up the hat rack and walks out, only for Gecky to almost fall. She dives in just in time to catch him.
Chilli: Ooh! Gotcha.
Credits roll.
