The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler house. It is a windy day, and someone is flying a kite. The scene cuts to the entryway. A toy cable car system has been set up between the table at the front door and the staircase landing. The cableway has two baskets on it, that can be sent from one end to the other by cranking a handle.
Chilli ducks under the cable to grab her keys, a bag, and a picnic blanket. She ducks it again as she opens the front door.
Chilli: Come on, kids. We have to go. Quick sticks!
Bluey pops her head over the stair railing.
Bluey: Oh, why?
Chilli: We're meeting Judo at the park. If we don't get a move on, we'll be late.
Bluey: Oh, can we not go just yet?
Chilli: Why not?
Bluey: Just...because?
Chilli: That's not a reason. Now, where's your hat?
Bluey: I don't know.
Bingo walks in.
Chilli: Well, find it. We're leaving in one minute.
Bingo stretches out her arms.
Bingo: Is one minute this long?
Chilli pushes Bingo's hands together; to about the width of Bingo's muzzle.
Chilli: More like this long. Have you cleaned your teeth?
Bingo: Yeah.
Chilli: Show me.
Bingo opens her mouth -- her teeth are stained green and yellow, and have vegetables stuck in them.
Bingo: Aaaah!
Chilli: When did you clean them?
Bingo: Last night.
Chilli: Okay, go and clean your teeth.
Bingo: Aww!
Chilli: Come on. I'll time you.
Chilli gets down on one knee and pantomimes holding a stopwatch. Bingo wags her tail excitedly.
Chilli: Ready, set, go!
Chilli: (imitating a stopwatch) Chik-chik-chik-chik-chik!
Bingo Ahhhh!
Bingo runs off screaming.
Bluey: Bingo, package!
Bingo: Aah!
Bingo skids to a stop, turns around, and runs to the door, ducking between Chilli's legs. Meanwhile, Bluey is sending something down the cableway.
Chilli: Ah! Hey! Bluey, hat. Bingo, teeth.
Bluey: I just need to deliver this.
Chilli: Deliver what?
Bingo pulls a purple gel gecko out of the cableway basket.
Bingo: Sticky gecko!
Chilli: Oh, no.
Bingo throws the sticky gecko on the ceiling.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
TITLE CARD - Sticky Gecko
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Sticky Gecko.
END TITLE CARD
Cut to a close-up of the gecko, stuck to the ceiling. One leg comes unstuck with a squelch.
Cut back to the entranceway. Bingo is waiting underneath the gecko, arms raised to catch it.
Bingo: Come to mama, little Gecky.
Chilli: I'm still timing you, Bingo! (imitates stopwatch) Chik-chik-chik-chik!
Bluey runs down the stairs.
Bingo: But I have to catch Gecky.
Bluey: You brush your teeth. I'll catch Gecky.
Bingo: Okay.
Bingo runs offscreen.
Chilli: No, you find your hat. I'll catch Gecky.
Chilli shoos Bluey over to the hatrack, and puts her arms out to catch Gecky. Bingo looks over the railing.
Bingo: Keep timing!
Chilli: (imitates stopwatch) Chik-chik-Chik-chik!
Bluey: I can't find it.
Chilli: Have you looked?
Bluey: Yeah, I've looked everywhere.
Chilli groans and points to the hat rack.
Chilli: There it is.
Bluey: Oh, yeah!
Bluey climbs on a bench to reach the hat rack.
Chilli: Come on, Gecky.
Bluey looks at the photo of Mort in uniform that hangs by the front door.
Bluey: What was it that Granddad used to say when he was a soldier?
Chilli: Hurry up and wait.
Bingo walks in eating a banana.
Bingo: Heehee! Hurry up and wait.
Chilli: Bingo, teeth!
Bingo: Oh, yeah!
Bingo throws the banana to Chilli and runs off.
Bluey knocks over the hat rack.
Chilli: Whoa!
Bluey: Sorry.
Chilli: Are you okay?
Bluey: Yeah, I'm okay.
Chilli: Good. Now, help me tidy this up.
Bluey: Oh, why do I have to help?
Chilli gives her a death glare.
Bluey: Ooh, okay.
Bingo appears at the railing, mouth full of toothpaste foam. She points with an electric toothbrush.
Bingo: Aah! Who's catching Gecky?
Chilli drops the hats and banana to hold her arms out to Gecky.
Chilli: Uh, I am!
Bingo: My banana!
Bluey: I'll get it! Here it comes! 
Bluey puts the banana in the basket and cranks it up to the landing. Bingo takes it while brushing her teeth.
Bingo: (with her mouth full) Thanks, Bluey!
She bites into the banana.
Bingo: Blah! Toothpaste-y!
She puts the banana back in the basket; gravity carries it back down. Bluey is now wearing her hat. Chilli rapidly tidies up the hats.
Chilli: Okay, let's go. I need you out the door in one minute.
Bluey: Can I have my hat like Granddad's, with the side bit up like that?
Chilli: Oh, look, Bluey...
Bluey: Please?
Chilli: Okay. Go and get a badge, but hurry up!
Bluey runs off. She trips over the hat rack, knocking it over again.
Bluey: Aaah! Sorry!
Bluey's hat falls off.
Chilli: Ughhh!
Chilli starts to pick up hats.
Bingo: Time for rollerskates!
Bingo drops a pair off rollerskates from the landing with a loud thud, startling Chilli.
Chilli: Aah!
Bingo: Mum, Gecky!
Chilli resumes gecko-catching position.
Chilli: Sorry! Come on, Gecky!
Bingo shows Chilli her now-clean teeth.
Chilli: (imitates stopwatch) Chik-chik Stop! Woah, one minute. Well done! Now, let's get going.
Bingo: I'm just gonna put on my rollerskates.
Chilli: Bingo, there's no time!
Bingo: Aww!
Chilli: Oh, alright, let me put them on for you.
Bingo: No, you have to time me.
Chilli': Okay. Ready, set, go. (imitates stopwatch) Chik-chik-chik-chik-chik!
Bingo: And we can't leave before Gecky falls off.
Chilli: Oh, look. I'm gonna give him a hand, alright?
Bluey appears at the railing. She's holding up a gold Australia badge.
Bluey: I found a badge!
She places a badge in the cable basket and starts cranking it down.
Chilli: Great. Bluey, can you please grab me my hockey stick? I need to get Gecky down.
Bluey: Okay.
Bluey stops cranking halfway and runs off. Bingo is just starting to tie her laces.
Bingo: The rabbit goes round the garden...nope, nope, try again.
Bluey brings in a squawking Chattermax.
Bluey: Look who I found!
Bingo: Chattermax!
Chilli: Bluey, hockey stick!
Bluey: I couldn't find it!
Chilli: Did you look? Oh, never mind. Give me that. I'll use Chattermax.
Chilli drags over a foot stool and stands on it. She repeatedly bashes a squawking Chattermax against the ceiling in an attempt to knock down Gecky.
Chilli repeatedly hits Chattermax's head on the ceiling in an attempt to get Gecky down. Her line while she does so was changed for Disney releases.
Chilli: (Australian version) Dammit! Really stuck!
Chilli: (Disney version) This thing is really stuck!
Bingo: Gecky doesn't like being rushed.
Chattermax: Poo poo! Poo poo!
Chattermax fires a barrage of chattersnax out of its bum, right in Chilli's face. Chilli falls off the stool, bounces off the cable way (knocking the badge to the floor), and lands on the floor. Chattermax dances out of the shot. Bingo finishes tying her rollerskates.
Bingo: Finished!
Chilli: They're on the wrong feet, darl.
Bingo: Are they? I'll start again.
Chilli: Oh, Bingo, there's just no--
Chilli steps on the Australia badge.
Chilli: OWW!
Bluey: Mum, have you seen my hat?
As Chilli reaches her breaking point, the camera performs a dolly zoom on her face.
Chilli: Oooooooo-AH! Alright, that's it!
Chilli plucks the badge out of her foot and slams the front door.
Chilli:We're not going to the park! 
Chilli plops down in am armchair and angrily opens a magazine.
Chilli: We're just staying here, then!
Chilli aggressively flips through the magazine. Bluey approaches timidly.
Bluey: So...we're not going anywhere?
Chilli: No, we'll just stay here forever!
Bluey: Oh.
Bluey sits down on the floor and hugs Floppy. Chilli flips through the magazine. Her eye twitches. She throws the magazine to the floor and opens the front door.
Chilli: That's it! Come on! Out, out, out!
Bluey: I don't understand!
Chilli: We're leaving now!
Bluey: Okay, okay! I just have to find my hat.
Chilli: Ughhh! The door. It is right here. All we need to do is walk out of it. It's so easy.
Bluey: Why do we have to go right now?
Chilli: Because I don't wanna be late.
Bluey: But why?
Chilli: Because it's not nice to keep people waiting. Especially Judo's mum. She can get a little funny if you're not on time.
Bluey: Oh. Why?
Chilli: Well, I guess she thinks it's rude. But it just takes ages getting out of the house.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: (amused) Because you kids don't care about being on time.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because you're too busy having fun. In fact, that's why we're going to the park. Judo's been asking for a playdate for ages.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli taps Bluey on the nose.
Chilli: Because you're a lovely little kid.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because I put a lot of work into making sure you're a lovely little kid.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because lovely little kids turn into lovely grownups. Like Judo's mum. She really is lovely, actually.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Well, when you were born, she made us five lasagnas.
Bluey: Mmm!
Chilli: It meant so much to me. That's the sort of person I want you to be.
Chilli ruffles Bluey's hair.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because I want you to have a happy life.
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: Because I love you!
Bluey: But why?
Chilli: Just...because!
Bluey and Bingo: That's not a reason!
Chilli: Oh, okay, you win! 
Chilli picks up Bluey and hugs her tight.
Chilli: So what's going on, Bluey? Why can't you get out the door?
Bluey: I'm just nervous about seeing Judo.
Chilli: I hear you. It's been a long time since you've seen her. 
Chilli puts Bluey's hat on her, and pins up the side with the Australia badge.
Chilli: Just be brave, okay? Like your granddad. (militaristic voice) Attention! 
Chilli and Bluey salute each other.
Chilli: Forward, march! 
Chilli shoos Bluey out the door.
Chilli: Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!
Bingo: Stop!
Chilli: Huh? Oh, oh, oh! (imitates stopwatch) Chik-chik-chick! Click! Oh!
Bingo: Was that one minute?
Chilli: Pretty much.
Bingo pumps her fist.
Bingo: Uss!
Chilli: You have no idea what a minute is, do you, sweetheart?
Bingo: Nope.
Chilli rolls Bingo out the door.
Chilli: Ahh, that must be nice. 
Chilli's phone goes off.
Chilli: It's Judo's mum. She's running late! Oh, well, take your time, kids.
Chilli twangs the cable line, launching the banana into the air. She catches it.
Bingo comes back in the door.
Bingo: I'm hungry. 
Chilli hands her the banana.
Bingo: Ooh, banana!
Bingo exits. Chilli picks up the hat rack, ducks under the cable, and walks out, closing the door behind her. The camera pans up -- Gecky slowly peels off the ceiling. As he hangs by a single foot, rapid footsteps approach. The door opens, and Chilli dives in, catching Gecky at the last second.
Chilli: Ooh! Gotcha.
The most energetic segment of the background music plays over the end credits. Instead of Bluey dancing, Bingo throws Gecky on the ceiling again, then runs offscreen.
