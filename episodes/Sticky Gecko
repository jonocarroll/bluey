The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler house on a windy day. Someone is flying a kite up high. And the wind gusts are so strong that leaves of palm-trees bend sideways.
Cut to the foyer. A toy hand-crank ropeway conveyor with two small baskets has been set up between the console table next to the entrance door and the staircase landing.
Chilli ducks under the rope to grab her keys from the tray. And picks up a bag and a picnic blanket roll on the floor in front of the table. 
Chilli: (vociferously) "Come on, kids; we have to go."
Chilli ducks under the rope again and opens the front door.
Chilli: "Quick sticks!"
Bluey pops her head above the guardrail of staircase landing.
Bluey: "Aw, why?"
Chilli: "We're meeting Judo at the park. If we don't get a move on, we'll be late."
Bluey: "Aww, can we not go just yet?"
Chilli: "Why not?"
Bluey: "Just...because?.."
Chilli: "That's not a reason. Now where's your hat?"
Bluey: "I don't know."
Bingo enters from right, padding towards and stopping next to Chilli.
Chilli: "Well, find it; we're leaving in one minute."
Bluey starts eyeing, looking around for something on the staircase landing.
Bingo: "Is one minute this long?"
Bingo stretches out her arms high and wide.
Chilli: "More like -
Chilli gently shorters the gap between Bingo's paws to about the width of Bingo's snout.
Chilli: - this long. Have you cleaned your teeth?"
Bingo: "Yeah."
Chilli: "Showw meEE."
Bingo audibly opens her mouth wide open -- her teeth are covered in stains of yellow and green accompanied by stuck pieces of vegetables.
Chilli: "When did you clean them?"
Bingo: "Last night."
Chilli: "Okay, go and clean your teeth."
Bingo: "Aww!"
Chilli: "Come on; I'll time you!"
Chilli gets down on one knee and pantomimes holding a stopwatch. Bingo wags her tail excitedly.
Chilli: "Ready-set-go!"
Chilli clicks and imitates the ticking of a stopwatch.
Chilli: "Chik-chik-chik-chik-chik!"
Bingo runs off to the right screaming in excitement.
Bluey, still standing next to the staircase landing crank, points at the previously empty basket now loaded with something.
Bluey: "Bingo, package!"
Bingo skids to a stop, turns around, and after a short yell runs to the door, crawling between Chilli's legs. Meanwhile, Bluey is operating the crank to deliver the loaded basket.
Chilli: "Hwargh! Hey! Bluey, hat. Bingo, teeth."
Bluey: "I just need to deliver this."
Chilli: "Deliver what?"
Bingo pulls a purple gel gecko out of the ropeway basket.
Bingo: "Sticky gecko!"
Chilli: "Oh no..."
Bingo run-ups towards Chilli who retreats next to the staircase landing wall. With a grunt, Bingo flings up the sticky gecko on the spot of the floor where Chilli previously was standing under.
Bluey, Bingo: "Hooray!"
TITLE CARD - STICKY GECKO
(voiceover) Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Sticky Gecko."
Cut to a close-up of the gecko still stuck to the ceiling, the front-right leg soon peeling loose with a squelch.
Cut back to the full view of the foyer. Bingo is waiting underneath the gecko, arms raised up to catch it.
Bingo: "Come to mama, little Gecky."
Chilli: "I'm still timing you, Bingo; Chik-chik-chik-chik!"
Bluey runs down the stairs and arrives next to Bingo.
Bingo: "But I have to catch Gecky."
Bluey: "You brush your teeth. I'll catch Gecky."
Bluey raises her arms now ready to catch Gecky.
Chilli puts the picnic items she was still carrying on the floor.
Bingo: "Okay."
Bingo skitters to the right off the scene.
Chilli: "No, you find your hat. I'll catch Gecky."
Chilli gently pushes Bluey over to the hat rack and puts her arms out to catch Gecky.
Bingo appears at the staircase landing high-heeling from behind the railing.
Bingo: "Keep timing!"
Bingo runs up the stairs.
Chilli: "Chik-chik-Chik-chik!"
Bluey: "I can't find it."
Chilli: "Have you looked?"
Bluey: "Yeah, I've looked everywhere."
Chilli groans loudly while rolling her eyes.
Chilli: "There it is."
Chilli points at the hat rack.
Bluey: "Oh, yeah!"
Bluey climbs up on the upholstered bench next to the hat rack while Chilli resumes to hold her open arms up towards Gecky.
Chilli: "Come on, Gecky."
Bluey looks at the photo of soldier Mort that hangs above the bench she is now standing atop of.
Bluey: "What was it that Granddad used to say when he was a soldier?"
Chilli: "Hurry up and wait."
Bingo walks in eating a banana.
Bingo: "Hehee! Hurry up and wait."
Chilli: "Bingo, teeth!"
Bingo: "Oh, yeah!"
Chilli promptly catches the banana Bingo flings up into air as she turns around and runs off chuckling nervously.
While reaching for her hat, Bluey knocks over the hat rack which falls right next to Chilli who yelps and jumps up a little due being startled.
Bluey: "Sorry!"
Chilli: "Are you okay?"
Bluey: "Yeah, I'm okay."
Chilli: "Good. Now help me tidy this up."
Chilli kneels down and starts putting the hats back on the rack.
Bluey: "Oo-uh, why do I have to help?"
After a small shock, Chilli swiftly turns her head to look at Bluey; the now visibly very indignant Chilli glares at Bluey in silence.
Bluey: "...Ooh, okay..."
Bluey climbs down from the bench.
Bingo soon is at the staircase landing; her chops and mouth covered in blue shaded toothpaste foam. She points at Gecky with an electric toothbrush.
Bingo: "Aah, who's catching Gecky?!"
Chilli: "Uh, I am!"
Chilli drops the hats and banana to hold her arms out to Gecky.
Bingo: "My banana!"
Bingo is now pointing at the banana with the toothbrush.
Bluey: "I'll get it! Here it comes! "
Bluey puts the banana in a conveyor basket and cranks it up to the landing. Bingo takes it while brushing her teeth.
Bingo: (mouthful) "Thanks, Bluey!"
She bites into the banana.
Bingo: "Blah! Toothpasty!"
Bingo puts the banana back in the basket; gravity carries it back down.
Bluey puts on her hat.
Chilli finishes putting the hats back on the rack which is still laying on the floor; Chilli soon juggles up the rack with her foot.
Chilli: "Okay, let's go. I need you out the door in one minute."
Chilli points to the outside. Bluey side-eyes and turns towards the earlier photos of soldier-Mort.
Bluey: "Can I have my hat like Granddad's, with the side bit up like that?"
Bluey points towards the spot in the photo where part of the flap of the hat Mort is wearing is pinned upwards.
Chilli: "Oh, look, Bluey..."
Bluey: "Please?"
Chilli: "Okay. Go and get a badge, but hurry up!"
As Bluey springs forward, her left shoulder knocks over the hat rack."
Bluey: (yips) "Sorry!"
Bluey's hat falls off.
Chilli groans loudly and picks up Bluey's hat.
Bingo appears at the staircase landing, her mouth is no longer covered in toothpaste foam. 
Bingo: "Time for roller-skates!"
Bingo holds a pair of roller-skates over the railing and drops them down with a loud thud, startling Chilli.
Chilli: "Aah!"
Bingo: "Mum, Gecky!"
Bingo points at Gecky and Chilli slides back to resume her gecko-catching position.
Chilli: "Sorry! Come on, Gecky!"
Bingo soon arrives next to Chilli, and audibly grins wide to show the now cleaned teeth.
Chilli: "Chik-chik Stop! Woah, one minute well done now let's get going."
Bingo: "I'm just gonna put on my roller-skates."
Bingo plops down next to her roller-skates she dropped.
Chilli: "Bingo, there's no time!"
Bingo: "Aww..."
Chilli: (sighs) "Alright, let me put them on for you."
Chilli Starts walking towards Bingo who puts up her arm to stop her.
Bingo: "No, you have to time me."
Chilli rolls her eyes and steps back to her Gecky-catching-spot to hold up her one arm while pantomiming a stopwatch again with another.
Chilli': "Ou-kay. Ready-set-go. Chik-chik-chik-chik-chik!"
Bingo: "And we can't leave before Gecky falls off."
Chilli: "Oh, look. (sighs) I'm gonna give him a hand, alright?"
Bluey appears at staircase landing now holding up a gold Australia badge.
Bluey: "I found a badge!"
Bluey puts the badge into the upper-rope basket and starts cranking it down.
Chilli: "Great. Bluey, can you please grab me my hockey stick? I need to get Gecky down."
Bluey: "Okay."
Bluey stops cranking halfway and runs off. Bingo is just starting to tie her laces.
Bingo: "The rabbit goes round the garden...no-no, try again."
Bluey brings in a squawking Chattermax.
Bluey: "Look who I found!"
Bingo: "Chattermax!"
Chilli: "Bluey, hockey stick!"
Bluey: "I couldn't find it!"
Chilli: "Did you look?...Gurh, never mind. Give me that; I'll use Chattermax."
Chilli drags over the footstool from underneath the console table and stands on it. She repeatedly hops bashing the squawking Chattermax into Gecky.
Chilli: (grunting) "Come, on! (muttering) This thing is, really, stuck!"
Bingo: "Gecky doesn't like being rushed."
Chilli kneels down a little to wind up for a much stronger hop; she then hops up and bashes Chattermax into Gecky with much greater force than before. Chattermax freaks out.
Chattermax: "Ah! Poo-poo! Poo-poo!"
Chattermax fires a barrage of chattersnax out of its bum right into Chilli's face.
Chilli loses her footing on the stool, falling backwards onto the conveyor ropes. The ropes fling her back up and she lands barely past the hat rack that is still laid flat on the floor alongside the hats.
Chattermax lands near the console table and dances off from the scene to the left.
In the midst of all this the Australia badge has fallen down from the basket landing on the floor between Chilli and Bingo.
Bingo finishes tying her roller-skates and stands up proudly.
Bingo: "Finished!"
Chilli: "...They're on the wrong feet, darl."
Bingo: "Are they?...I'll start again."
Bingo plops down again just before Chilli stands up and starts walking towards Bingo.
Chilli: "Oh Bingo, there's just no--"
Chilli steps on the Australia badge."
Chilli: "OWWW!"
Bingo continues putting on her roller-skates unfaced.
Bluey arrives to the scene from the right while Chilli is jumping on one foot holding up the foot with the dug-in Australia badge.
Bluey: "Mum, have you seen my hat?"
Chilli freezes.
The camera performs a dolly zoom on Chilli's face while she is reaching to her breaking point.
Chilli: "Oooooooo-ARGH! Right, that's it!"
Chilli plucks the badge out of her foot and pushes the front door shut with a loud bang."
Chilli: "We're not going to the park!"
Chilli plops down in the corner armchair and angrily begins to browse a magazine.
Chilli: "We're just staying here then!"
Chilli aggressively flips through the magazine. Bluey approaches timidly.
Bluey: "So...we're not going anywhere?"
Chilli: "No, we'll just stay here forever!"
Bluey: "Oh..."
Bluey sits down on the floor and huggles Floppy.
 Chilli flips through the magazine at an increasing speed twitching her eyes .
Suddenly she throws the magazine to the floor startling Bluey.
Chilli drags the front door wide open.
Chilli: "That's it! Come on. out-out-out!!!"
Bluey: "I don't understand!!!"
Chilli: "We're leaving now!"
Bluey: "Okay, okay! I just have to find my hat."
Chilli moans in disbelief walking towards the door opening to which she kneels in front of.
Chilli: "The door: It is right here. All we need to do is walk out of it: it's so easy!"
Bluey: "Why do we have to go right now?"
Chilli: "Because I don't wanna be late!"
Bluey: "But why?"
Chilli: "Because it's not nice to keep people waiting. Especially Judo's mum. She can get a little funny if you're not on time."
Bluey: "Oh, why?"
Chilli: "Well, I guess she thinks it's rude. But it just takes ages getting out of the house."
Bluey: "Why?"
Chilli: (sneerly) "Because you kids don't care about being on time."
Bluey: "Why?"
Chilli: "Because you're too busy having fun. In fact, that's why we're going to the park: Judo's been asking for a playdate for ages."
Bluey: "Why?"
Chilli gently taps on the nose of Bluey.
Chilli: "Because you're a lovely little kid."
Bluey: "Why?"
Chilli: "Because I put a lot of work into making sure you're a lovely little kid."
Bluey: "Why?"
Chilli: "Because lovely little kids turn into lovely grownups. Like Judo's mum: She really is lovely actually."
Bluey: "Why?"
Chilli: "Well, when you were born, she made us five lasagnas."
Bluey hums gleefully.
Chilli: "It meant so much to me. That's the sort of person I want you to be."
Chilli gently ruffles Bluey's head a little.
Bluey: "Why?"
Chilli: "Because I want you to have a happy life."
Bluey: "Why?"
Chilli: "Because I love you!"
Bluey: "But why?"
Chilli: "Just...because!"
Bluey and Bingo: "That's not a reason!"
Chilli: "Oh, okay, you win! "
Chilli picks up Bluey and hugs her tight. Bluey snorts a little before CHilli let's her down.
Chilli: (sighs) "So what's going on, Bluey? Why can't you get out the door?"
Bluey nervously looks down, twirling her finger.
Bluey: "...I'm just nervous about seeing Judo."
Chilli: "I hear you: it's been a long time since you've seen her. "
Chilli picks up Bluey's hat.
Chilli: "Just be brave, okay?
Chilli puts the hat on Bluey.
Chilli: Like your granddad.
Chilli pins up the flap on the side of the hat with the Australia badge."
Chilli: "Atten-shun! "
Chilli and Bluey salute each other.
Chilli: "Forward, march!"
Chilli points towards the door opening and shoos Bluey out the door."
Chilli: "Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!"
Bluey runs out giggling.
An excited Bingo with her roller-skate tied is now standing up behind Chilli.
Bingo: "Stop!"
Chilli: "Huh? Oh, oh, oh! Chik-chik-chik, click! Haa!"
Bingo: "Was that one minute?"
Chilli: "Pretty much."
Bingo pumps her fists.
Bingo: "Oos!"
Chilli grabs a hold of Bingo's arm.
Chilli: "You have no idea what a minute is, do you, sweetheart?"
Bingo: "Nope."
Chilli slides Bingo towards the door and picks up the picnic items."
Chilli: (sighs) "That must be nice."
Chilli's phone goes off.
Chilli: "It's Judo's mum: She's running late! Oh well, take your time, kids."
Chilli twangs the lower rope, launching the banana out of the basket and into her paw.
Bingo skates back to the door.
Bingo: "I'm hungry."
Chilli hands her the banana.
Bingo: "Oo, banana!"
Bingo goes back outside.
 Chilli juggles up the hat rack alongside Floppy with her foot, ducks under the ropes, and walks out, closing the door behind her.
The camera pans up to reveal Gecky finally losing the grip. As Gecky is hanging by the hind legs, rapid footsteps approach. The door is flung open with Chilli diving in to catch Gecky, managing barely prevent Gecky hitting the floor.
Chilli: "...Gotcha."
The most energetic segment of the background music plays over the end credits.
Instead of Bluey dancing, Bingo again flings up Gecky which gets stuck into something. Bingo then runs back offscreen.
