Bluey: Just take the pizza.
Bandit: Uh... okay. Ugh...
Bluey: Thanks, bye! 
Bandit: Aw, man.
Bluey: I'm back, pizza sister! 
Bluey: Aw, not again!

Chilli: Well...
Bingo: Fixed!

Muffin: Okay.
BOTH: Hooray! 
Bluey: Okay. Were all sisters who run the pizza shop. 
Muffin: Got it. 
Bluey: Hmm... there's no roof to stick the pizza sign on. 
Muffin: It's a convertible. 
Bluey: Okay, well, I guess we don't need to use it. Hello, customers.
Stripe: And you just do this with your foot, and that opens the boot! 
Bandit: Oh, cool. 
Bluey: Customers! 
Bingo: The phone's not working. 
Muffin: I'll just ask them. 
Bluey: Wait, Muffin, no! Were meant to do it over the phone! 
Muffin: They want a supreme. 
Bluey: Okay. One supreme. Thanks, pizza sisters.
Bingo: Our mum started this pizza shop, she worked really hard, so were trying to give her a holiday. 
Bluey: Wow, were gonna deliver pizzas fast now. 
Muffin: Ah! Stop! 
Bluey: I'm just putting the pizza in? 
Muffin: You can't bring mud in the new car. 
Bluey: What? Why?
Muffin: Cause it's very expensive. 
Bluey: Oh, okay. Well, what do we do?
Muffin: We have to play something else. 
ALL: Aw...
Bluey: What else do you play in it? 
Muffin: I usually just drive around.

Muffin: Okay.
Bluey: Alright, here we go! 
Bluey: What's going on?
Muffin: Oh, it's out of battery. 
Bluey: Aw.

Bingo: Okay, I'll get started. 
Bluey: How's the car, mechanic? 
Muffin: I put this one on which makes it go extra fast.
Bluey: Oh wow, you're a good mechanic. 
Muffin: Thanks! 
Bluey: Alright, I'll make the garlic breads.
