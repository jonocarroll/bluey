Bluey: Just take the pizza.
Bandit: Uh... okay. Ugh...
Bluey: Thanks, bye! 
Bandit: Aw, man.
Bluey: I'm back, pizza sister! 
Bluey: Aw, not again! 
Bingo: Oh, I can fix it. 
Bluey: Mum, can we get a new car?
Chilli: Aw, but you've had Pedley since you were two. 
Bluey: But the wheel keeps falling off. 
Chilli: I know, but there's just a lot of stories in that car. 
Bluey: How can a car have stories? 
Chilli: Well...
Bingo: Fixed! 
Chilli: Ah, there you go. See? Good as new! 
Muffin: Is my car scratched? 
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called 'Pizza Girls'. 
Bluey: What is this, Muffin?! 
Muffin: It's an electric car. My dad brought a new car, and this came with it! 
Bingo: It drives without pedals! 
Stripe: Yes, and it's very expensive Muffin, so be careful with it. 
Bluey: Can we play Pizza Girls in it? 
Muffin: Okay.
BOTH: Hooray! 
Bluey: Okay. Were all sisters who run the pizza shop. 
Muffin: Got it. 
Bluey: Hmm... there's no roof to stick the pizza sign on. 
Muffin: It's a convertible. 
Bluey: Okay, well, I guess we don't need to use it. Hello, customers.
Stripe: And you just do this with your foot, and that opens the boot! 
Bandit: Oh, cool. 
Bluey: Customers! 
Bingo: The phone's not working. 
Muffin: I'll just ask them. 
Bluey: Wait, Muffin, no! Were meant to do it over the phone! 
Muffin: They want a supreme. 
Bluey: Okay. One supreme. Thanks, pizza sisters.
Bingo: Our mum started this pizza shop, she worked really hard, so were trying to give her a holiday. 
Bluey: Wow, were gonna deliver pizzas fast now. 
Muffin: Ah! Stop! 
Bluey: I'm just putting the pizza in? 
Muffin: You can't bring mud in the new car. 
Bluey: What? Why?
Muffin: Cause it's very expensive. 
Bluey: Oh, okay. Well, what do we do?
Muffin: We have to play something else. 
ALL: Aw...
Bluey: What else do you play in it? 
Muffin: I usually just drive around.
Bluey: Okay, let's do that. 
Muffin: Watch your feet!

Bluey: Can I have a turn?
Muffin: Okay.
Bluey: Alright, here we go! 
Bluey: What's going on?
