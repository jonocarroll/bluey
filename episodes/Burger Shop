The episode begins with Bluey and Bingo playing in the bathtub, while Bandit is sitting on the floor right next to the shower, reading a book. Chilli walks in.
Chilli: Come on, kids, it's bedtime. Out of the bath.
Bingo: Aww, but we were about to play Burger Shop.
Chilli: Tough. Can you earn your keep, please?
Bandit: Nah, I'm done being a meanie parent. My new parenting book says not to boss the kids around.
Bluey: Ooh, I like that book.
Bandit: It says here, we should let them make their own decisions.
Chilli: Well, good luck with that. 
Bluey: OK, burger shop's ready. Oh, look, our first customer. What would you like to order?
Bandit: Bluey, I'm gonna let you make the decision here. You can stay up late playing Burger Shop and you'll be tired and grumpy in the morning, or, you could get out now and be nice and happy in the morning.
Bluey: So it's up to us?
Bandit: Yep.
Bluey: Hmm... What would you like to order?
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called "Burger Shop".
Bandit: OK, just a quick game.
Bluey: Hooray!
Bandit: I'll have one burger, please.
Bluey: Certainly. One burger, please.
Bingo: Coming right up.
Bluey: Boop!
Bandit: Are you sure you --
Bluey: Do you want chips with your burger?
Bandit: Uh, OK.
Bluey: Doot!
Bandit: -- don't want to --
Bluey: And chips!
Bingo: OK!
Bandit: -- get out of the bath?
Bluey: No. Five dollarbucks.
Bandit: Oh, yeah. Uh... Here you go!
Bluey: Thanks. Won't be long.
Bandit: 'Cause it's getting a bit late.
Bingo: Ding! Ready!
Bluey: Just a moment, please.
Bluey: Here you go. 
Bandit: Oh, thanks. Now, it's up to you, but think about how tired you'll be if Wow, this is a good burger.
Chilli: I thought I said get out of the bath!
Bandit: I'm working on it.
Chilli: Yeah, it looks like it. I'm pulling the plug.
Bluey and Bingo: No!
Bingo: We're still playing!
Chilli: Get out of the way, kids.
Bandit: Hey, hey, whoa, whoa! Let's settle this down.
Chilli: What?
Bandit: Pulling plugs is not in my book. Phew! She's a bit of a meanie, isn't she, kids?
Bluey: Yes, she is.
Bandit: I think I can trust you to make the right choice on when to get out, can I?
Bluey: Yes, dad.
Bandit: So, what do you say? Time to get out?
Bluey: Yeah.
Bandit: Great.
Bluey: After you order another burger.
Bandit: But I just had a burger.
Bluey: Yeah, but it was so good, you wanted another one.
Bandit: Well, it was pretty good. OK, one more won't hurt.
Bluey: Great. One burger and chips!
Bingo: OK.
Bandit: I'll skip the chips.
Bluey: No, you won't.
Bandit: Fair enough.
Bluey: Five dollarbucks.
Bandit: There you go.
Bingo: Ding! Ready!
Bluey: I'll be right back.
Bluey dives under the water and gets the burger and chips from Bingo, then swims back to Bandit, splashing him again.]
Bluey: Here you go!
Bandit: Thanks! Delicious.
Bluey: Wow, you ate that quick!
Bandit: I've got things to do. Now, is it time to get out?
Bluey: Not yet. You haven't tried our... new burger.
Bandit: Right...
Bluey: One new burger.
Bingo: Hmm, new burger, let's see... Ooh, I know: pickle burger. Ding! Ready!
Bluey: Pickle burger.
Bandit: Ooh, it does look pretty good.
Bluey: Five dollarbucks.
Bandit: Oh, I'm out of money. Oh well, I guess that's the game over. 
Bluey: Wait, no! It's OK, we're selling them for free!
Bingo: No, we're not!
Bluey: OK, we're not selling them for free, but you can have your money back. 
Bingo: Hey, that's our money!
Bluey: OK, you can't have that back. 
Bandit: Oh.
Bluey: But he needs more money!
Bingo: Where do you get money from?
Bluey: I don't know. Dad, where do you get money from?
Bandit: Um... you can borrow some from the bank, I guess.
Bluey: Oh, OK! Welcome! This is the bank. Would you like some money? 
Bandit: I guess.
Bluey: Excellent. Here you go. It's your money.
Bandit: Aren't you going to quacks me what I need it for?
Bluey: No.
Bandit: Are you sure? 'Cause I'll probably just spend it all on burgers.
Bluey: Ooh, that's a great idea. Here, have some more. 
Bandit: Oh, thanks.
Bluey: Goodbye. Hello. Here's your pickle burger.
Bandit: And here's five dollar bucks. Oh, you can really taste the pickle. Om nom nom nom nom!
Bluey: Have another one.
Bandit: No, no, I'm full. Look, I really think you kids need to --
Bluey: But, um... This one comes with a toy!
Bandit: Ooh! You should've said. Wow! OK, take my money. Pew! Pew!
Bluey: Now, what would you like to order?
Bandit: Nothing for me, thank you. I'm so full. And I've got my dolphin toy. I really must be off now.
Bluey: But you can't go. You haven't got the octopus and the stingray. You have to collect them all.
Bandit: Bluey!
Bluey: Two burgers.
Bingo: OK. 
Bandit: Hey, you're chef looks cold.
Bluey: She's fine.
Bandit: She's shivering!
Bluey: Five dollarb-bucks.
Bandit: And so are you!
Bluey: I'm f-fine!
Bandit: Your lips are blue!
Bluey: I'm a blue heeler. 
Bandit: Bluey, I'm trying to get you out of the bath without being a meanie, but you have to help me.
Bluey: But we're not finished!
Bingo: We still have to sell all these burgers.
Bandit: Ugh. OK, I'll take all of these. Delicious. There, you sold all your burgers.
Bingo: Wow.
Bandit: Now, time to get out?
Bluey: Yes.
Bandit: Ah, great.
Bluey: After you pay.
Bandit: Huh?
Bluey: Let's see. A hundred burgers... Doot! That's a hundred dollarbucks, please.
Bandit: But I haven't got any money left.
Bingo: Well then how are you gonna pay for all those burgers you just ate?
Bluey: More dirty dishes for you.
Bandit: Thanks b-boss.
Chilli: You're still in the bath!
Bandit: I'm trying to teach personal responsibility!
Chilli: Her lips are blue!
Bandit: She's a blue heeler!
Chilli: I'm pulling the plug.
Bandit Bingo and Bluey: No!
Bluey: Mum, this is our burger shop!
Chilli: It's 7 o'clock. you're supposed to be out of the bath and you're not even meant to be in it!
Bandit: The book says to let them make their own choices.
Chilli: They're in preschool.
Bandit: They can do it! Watch. Kids, no one wants to eat more burgers and it's past your bedtime. I REALLY don't wanna be a meanie parent, but I need you to make a good choice right now.
Bluey and Bingo: OK, dad.
Bandit: So, what are you going to do?
Bluey: Um... well... Alright, we'll close the burger shop.
Bandit: Great.
Bluey: And open a taco shop! 
Bingo: Yeah!
Bandit: That's it! I'm pulling the plug!
Bluey: No way, you big meanie!
Bandit: Nice and warm now?
Bluey and Bingo: Yes, dad.
Bluey: I'm sorry we didn't get out of the bath sooner.
Bandit: That's OK. I'm sorry I didn't make you. I guess I'll be a meanie for a bit longer, right?
Bluey: Yeah.
Bluey: Hee! We look like hedgehogs!
Chilli: OK, kids. Straight into bed.
Bluey and Bingo: Yes, mum. 
Bingo: Dad, can we play hedgehogs?
Bandit: Uh... well...
Bandit: OK.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Bandit: Just a quick game.
