The episode opens with a first-person shot from Bandits's perspective as he opens his eyes. He sees Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo right in front of him. He awakes with a jerk.
Bandit: (snorts) Aaah!
The shot cuts to a third person view. Bandit is lying in bed, with Chilli standing beside him and Bluey and Bingo sitting on the bed. 
Chilli, Bluey, Bingo: Happy Birthday!
Bandit: Oh, wow. Thanks, girls!
Bluey: Uh-uh! Down, down. Stay.
Bingo: We're going to make you breakfast in bed.
The girls climb down off the bed.
Bandit: Oh, great! Uh... Just a friendly question...
Chilli: Don't worry, it won't take long.
Bandit: Oh, thanks.
Chilli: Because we know how you get when you're hungry.
Chilli exits.
Bluey: Cranky.
Bluey exits.
Bingo: Stay.
Cut to the kitchen. Bluey and Chilli enter, followed by Bingo.
Chilli: Alright, here's the plan: I'll make Dad an omelette, Bluey, you set the brekkie tray, and Bingo, you make the birthday card. Quickly!
We don't want Dad getting hungry.
Bluey and Bingo: Okay!
Bluey and Bingo run off. Chilli puts on an apron.
Chilli: Okay, super-quick omelette. 
Chilli waggles her fingers.
Chilli: My specialty. Oh!
Chilli takes a step back, Bingo has appeared right in front of her.
Chilli: Hi, Bingo.
Bingo: Hi.
Chilli: Are... you going to get started
on the birthday card?
Bingo holds up a card.
Bingo: I already made one at kindy.

Chilli: Oh! That's lovely!
Cut back to the wider shot.
Bingo: I want to help you make the omelette.
Chilli: (dismayed) Oh. That's...lovely.
TITLE CARD - Omelette

Cut back to the kitchen. Chilli and Bingo are standing at the counter; Bingo is standing on the step stool.
Bingo: What do we do first?
Chilli: Well, first we need some eggs.
Bingo: Ooh, no, I can get them!
Chilli: Oh, okay.
Bingo starts shoving the wooden step stool across the floor. It makes a loud scraping sound. Chilli covers her ears.
Chilli: Oh, Bingo! That's awfully loud, honey!
Bingo pushes the stool all the way up against the freezer, walks up the steps, and opens the refrigerator.
Bingo: Come here, eggies!
Bingo removes a topless carton of eggs from the fridge. She knocks a stalk of celery onto the floor.
Bingo: Not you, celery!
Chilli: I'll get that.
Chilli picks the celery up and puts it back in the fridge. She closes the door
Bingo climbs down from the stool. She's holding the carton of eggs by the very end, and it bends dangerously.
Chilli: Oh. Uh. Do you want me to carry those for you?
The carton bends further.
Bingo No! It's okay. I'm almost there!
Two of the six eggs fall out of the carton and break on the floor.
Bingo: Oops!
Chilli: It's okay! I'll clean it up.
Chilli gets a roll of paper towels.
Bingo: No, I can do it!
Chilli: Okay. Here's the paper towels.
She hands the paper towels to Bingo.
Bingo: (giggles) and... hup!
Bingo throws the roll of paper towels out the window, unrolling a streamer of towels behind it. She reels in a dozen or so paper towels.
Chilli: I'll make a start on the omelette, honey. I'll just crack the eggs.
Bingo has arranged the towels into a pile on top of the eggs.
Bingo: Can I help crack the eggies?
Chilli: Um... Sure, honey. How about I sort this out and you get started on the eggs?
Chilli takes over the pile of paper towels.
Chilli : Grab a silver bowl from the cupboard.
Bingo: Okay.
Bingo runs off, and Chilli starts to clean up the eggs. A moment later, a loud crash sounds from offscreen.
Chilli: (yelps)
A bowl rolls into the shot and spins around on its rim.
Cut to a wider shot showing Bingo surrounded by pots and pans. She's holding up a silver mixing bowl.
Bingo: Is this one okay?

Cut to the kitchen. Bingo climbs the step stool and puts the silver bowl on the counter.
Bingo: How many eggs are in an omelette?
Chilli is stacking bowls back in the cupboard.
Chilli: Um... Three or four.
Bandit: (yelling from offscreen) I'm hungry!
Chilli: Better make it four.
Bingo counts out the eggs, laying each one on the counter, where they slowly roll away.
Bingo: One. Two. Three.
Chilli: Come on Bingo, bit quicker.
Bingo: Four--
Bingo notices her eggs are about to roll off the counter.
Bingo: Oh, no!
Bingo grabs the silver bowl and climbs down the steps. She runs to the end of the counter, and uses the bowl to catch the eggs.'
Bingo: Agh! One!
She leaps to the right to catch the second egg.
Bingo: Ee! Two!
And back to the left for the third egg.
Bingo: Agh! Three!
She looks around.
Bingo: Hey, where's four?
Chilli closes the cabinet and gets up.'
Chilli: Done. How are the eggs doing, Bingo?
The fourth egg rolls off the side of the counter instead of the end, cracking at Chilli's feet.
Chilli: Ooh!
Bingo: There's four!
Cut to the bedroom.
Bandit: Hello?! Is brekkie almost ready?!
Cut back to the kitchen. Chilli is wiping up the egg.
Chilli: It's coming!
Chilli stands up and claps her hands together.
Chilli: Okay, birthday boy's getting cranky. Let's get cracking, Bingo. Ha! Get it? "Cracking"!
Bingo giggles, then smacks her egg down on the side of the silver bowl. The egg doesn't break, but the force of the blow launches the bowl off the table. The shot pulls back to show Bluey walking across the kitchen with a carton of orange juice. The bowl hits the orange juice, knocking Bluey over and spilling orange juice on the floor in front of the fridge.
Bluey: (yelps)
Chilli Ohmygoodness!
Bingo: Sorry, Bluey!
Bluey sits up.
Bluey: It's okay, I'll clean it up.
The shot cuts back to show just Chilli and Bingo at the counter.
Chilli: Thanks, Bluey.
Chilli holds the bowl in place for Bingo.
Chilli: Okay, try again, honey.
Bluey: (offscreen) Agh!
A roll of paper towels soars over Chilli's head, bouncing off the wall.
Chilli: I'll just hold it for you.
Bingo repeatedly taps the egg on the edge of the bowl.
Chilli: A bit harder, honey.
Bingo taps the egg slightly harder.
Chilli: Give it a good whack.
Bingo: Rrrah!
Bingo winds up and smashes the egg on the edge of the silver bowl. Yolk and albumen splatter the bowl, countertop, Chilli, and Bingo.
Bingo: (giggles)
Chilli: That's too hard.
Bingo drops the eggshells into the bowl.
Chilli: Oh, uh... No, honey, the shells don't go in.
Chilli removes the eggshells. She hands Bingo a new egg.
Chilli: Let's try again.
Bingo: Okay.
Bingo resumes tapping the egg lightly.
Chilli's phone rings. Caller ID shows it's Bandit. Chilli taps the button with her pinky.
Chilli: Hello?
Cut to the bedroom.
Bandit: Hi. Uh... Will breakfast be in my mouth soon?
Cut to the kitchen. Bingo is still tapping the egg.
Chilli: It's on its way!
Chilli holds the phone close to her mouth and turns away.
Chilli: (quietly) I'm just letting Bingo help me.
Bingo winds up for a big hit.
Cut to the bedroom.
Bandit: I don't want to complain, but--
A wet squelch is heard over the phone.
Chilli: (over the phone) Agh!
Bingo: (over the phone) Sorry!
Bandit: Was that my breakfast?!
Cut back to the kitchen. Fresh egg drips from Bingo and Chilli's faces.
Bingo: That was a big one.
Chilli: I've got to go.
Chilli hangs up the phone.
Chilli: Bingo, I might handle the omelette, honey.
Bingo: Oh, you don't want my help?
Chilli: Um... I do, but it might be quicker if I do it.
Bingo: Oh. Okay.
Chilli: Why don't you help Bluey set the breakfast tray?
Bluey: I don't need help. I'm finished!
Bingo: Ohh.
Chilli: Well, um... Oh, look, Bingo - you could play with the salt and pepper soldiers. You love them.
Bingo: Okay, Mama.
Bingo sadly climbs down the step stool. Chilli watches sadly. The phone rings, Chilli picks it up.
Chilli: (annoyed) It's coming!
Cut to inside the fridge. Chilli opens the door, grabs the celery, and hands it to Bluey.
Chilli: Bluey, run this celery up to Dad.

Bingo: (as pepper soldier) Ooh. I'll come too.
Bingo: (as salt soldier) No, you can't guard the queen.
Bingo: (as pepper soldier) Why not?
Bingo: (as salt soldier) You're not good at it.
Bingo: (as pepper soldier) I am. Really, I am.
Bingo: (as salt soldier) No. You better stay at home.
Bingo: (as pepper soldier) But I'm a guard just like you.

Bingo: (as salt soldier) Bye!
Bingo: (as pepper soldier) Bye!

Bingo: (as Queen Orange Juice) Oh, hello.
Cut back to Chilli in the kitchen, who has been watching this whole exchange. Her phone rings. She answers.
Chilli: (imitating error message) The number you have dialed has been disconnected.
Bandit: (on phone) Hey, what?!
Chilli: Bingo, come here.
Bingo walks over and climbs up to the counter.
Chilli: I made an omelette for Dad, but... I didn't make it the right way.
Bingo: Really?
Chilli: Yeah. I need your help making another one.
Bingo perks up and wags her tail.
Bingo: Okay!
Bandit walks in, wearing a blanket as a cape. Bluey is laying on the cape in a futile attempt to slow him down.
Bandit: (hoarsely) Is that an omelette I can smell?
Bingo and Chilli: Get back upstairs!
Bandit: (hoarsely) It is! Can I just...
Chilli threatens him with the whisk.
Chilli: No! This isn't for you.
Bingo: (giggles)
Bandit: (hoarsely) Wha-? Well, who's it for?
