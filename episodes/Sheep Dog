{The episode starts at the kitchen. Chilli is preparing dinner and is visibly stressed. Bluey is playing her recorder}
Bingo: Knock, knock.
Chilli: Bluey, that's a bit loud, honey.
Bluey: Sorry! 
Bingo: Knock, knock!
Chilli: Oh, who's there, hon?
Bingo: Potato!
Chilli: Bluey. Too loud! Potato who?
Bingo: Potato drives a car to the potato shop, and... buys a potato. 
Chilli: That's a good one, Bingo.
Chilli: Bluey!
Bluey: Sorry! 
Bingo: Knock, knock!
Bandit: Hey kids, I'm back from my haircut!
Bluey and Bingo: Dad!
Chilli: Right. Dinner's in the slow cooker and the powdered afternoon tea. I need 20 minutes when no one comes near me.
Bluey: What?
Bandit: Oh. Yep. Ok!
Bandit: Come on, kids. Daddy-daughter time.
Bingo: Hooray!
Chilli: And you've got a mullet!
Bandit: She said they were back in!
Bluey: Is Mum ok?
Bandit: Yep.
Bluey: Did we do something wrong?
Bingo: And what's a mullet?
Bandit: No, you didn't, and it's a type of haircut that cool people are starting to get again.
Bluey: Does she wish she never had us?
Bandit: Nah, Bluey. Of course not. She just needs 20 minutes.
Pat: Ha! Nice mullet, Bandit! 
Bluey: I'm just going to see if she's ok.
Bandit: Whoa! Hey, hey! No! Don't do that. Stay here! You can, um, watch me do the cancan!
Bandit: Dun! Da da da da da da! Dun da da da da da!
Bandit: Da da da da da, da da ta ta, hey!
Bluey: I'm going to see Mum.
Bandit: No, no, no, wait. Isn't there some sort of game that you always want to play that I can't stand?
Bluey: Yes?
Bandit: Right. Well, let's play that!
Bluey: What? For real life?
Bandit: Oh, hang on. What is it again?
Bluey and Bingo: Sheep dog!!
Bandit: Ugh, that's right.
