We open on Bluey and Bingo drawing with chalk on the pavement whilst humming. Suddenly, a white truck pulls up whilst blasting rock music. Someone can be heard vocalising along with the music. Bluey and Bingo hear this, and look over. A bull mastiff man wearing a yellow shirt and shorts exits the car. This is Sparky, one of two tradies we meet in this episode.
Bluey: Huh? Who's that? 
A green car pulls up, blasting electronic music.
Bingo: And who is that? 
An afghan hound man opens the door, and a saluki woman is revealed to be inside as well. He exits the car and waves at the woman, who doesn't return the gesture and drives off. This is Chippy, the second of two tradies we meet. The two men look at each other and smile, nodding. They start approaching the house.
Bluey: Ah! Enemies! Bark at them! 
Bluey and Bingo get up and run towards the tradies, barking at them. The two stop in front of them and just look at them oddly.=
Bluey: It's not working! Run! 
The two scream while running inside. The tradies start walking towards the house. Chippy takes a sip from a chocolate milk bottle. We cut to Chilli talking to the two tradies in the backyard.
Chilli: I'm working from home this week, so yell if you need me.
Sparky: No worries, Chilli. 
Bluey and Bingo are seen hiding under the house, spying on the tradies, the people who they believe to be their enemies.
Bluey: He knows Mum's name. 
We cut to near Bluey's perspective.
Chilli: And you're sure it'll only take three days?
Sparky scratches his neck.
Sparky: Yeah, three or four.
Chilli crosses her arms and gives Sparky a deadpan look.
Chilli: Is it three or is it four? 
We cut to the earlier view with Bluey and Bingo underneath the house.
Bingo: What will be three or four?
Bluey: I don't know! 
Sparky walks off, singing. Chilli walks inside, whilst Chippy sprays red spray paint on the grass. The two jump, as they see Chippy do so with a small scream..
We cut to a side perspective where Chilli is seen about to enter the house again.
Bluey: Psst, Mum! 
Chilli: Huh?
Chilli looks around to see where the source of the voice she heard is.
Bluey: Down here. 
She waves her hand to signal where she is, which catches Chilli's attention.
Chilli: Oh, hey girls. 
Chilli kneels down to look at the girls.
Bluey: Who are they?!
Bingo: And why are they painting our grass?! 
Chilli puts one of her feet on the first step to the house.
Chilli: They're tradies. They're putting in a fishpond. 
Bluey: When are they leaving?
Chilli: Well, they said three days, but now I'm not so sure. Keep an eye on them for me, alright? Make sure they're working hard. 
BOTH: Okay! 
Chilli walks up the steps.
Bluey: Bingo! 
Bingo: Yes?
Bluey: We're going to spy on the tradies. 
Bingo: Uss. 
The title card appears, a bottle of chocolate milk.
Bluey (reading): This episode of Bluey is called Tradies. 
We cut to the backyard, where the tradies digging a hole. Sparky is telling a story to Chippy.
Sparky: It just needs the hole fixed up and a new outlook. 
Back to Bluey and Bingo's shot, where Bingo is using a magnifying glass.
Bluey: All he does is talk about his boat! 
Sparky: I don't know. What's going on?
Chippy's phone makes a notification sound. He pulls his phone out and looks at it.
Chippy: I'm just going to the truck. 
Chippy gets out of the hole and walks to the truck.
Sparky: Alrighty, don't be long. We've got a lot to do. 
Bingo: Where's Chocolate Milk going? 
Bluey: I don't know. I'll follow him. You watch Big Belt. 
Bluey walks out of their hiding place to go spy on Chippy. We then see Bluey looking into the front yard, where Chippy is texting on his phone.
Bluey: Hmm, he's on his phone. 
Sparky walks in the front yard and spots Chippy texting on his phone, and he is not happy about it.
Sparky: Oi. 
Chippy: Oh, sorry boss.
Bluey narrates over the scene, before it switches to Bluey and Bingo talking to Chilli in her office. Chilli is doing some work from home by typing something on her laptop.
Bluey: And then Big Belt called Chocolate Milk that word Dad said when the mower didn't start. 
Chilli: Oh dear. Are they working hard? 
Bingo: Chocolate Milk isn't. He's on his phone all the time! 
Bluey: Yeah. Big Belt does not like it. 
Chilli stops working and gets up, looking out the window through the blinds. She closes her eyes halfway as she=spots Chippy texting instead of working.
Chilli: Neither do I, I want that pond done in three days. 
Bingo: Do you think Big Belt and Chocolate Milk are enemies? 
Bluey: Yes. And both of them are our enemies. 
We cut to Chilli's POV where she is still spying on Chippy, who is unaware that he is being spied on.
Chilli: I wonder who he's texting. 
Bluey: Ooh. We can find out! 
Bluey and Bingo run off to go spy on the tradies some more. We cut to Chippy and Sparky, who are putting rocks down around the hole. After a few seconds, Chippy gets a notification from his phone. Chippy grabs his phone to text, causing Sparky to get up and walk off.
Sparky: Oi, back to work. Not here for a haircut, Chippy.
He wheels a wheelbarrow with dirt in it away. As Sparky walks off, Chippy gets out of the hole and calls someone.
Bluey: Okay, he's phone calling. 
Bluey: I'm going to get closer. 
Bluey crawls away to go spy on Chippy's phone call.
Bingo: I'll watch Big Belt. 
Bingo walks off to go spy on Sparky.
Chippy: I didn't say that. 
Bluey wheels her toy car over while hiding herself to spy on Chippy. Chippy is too distracted with his phone call to notice.
Chippy: I did say that, but I didn't mean it, babe. 
Bluey keeps wheeling her toy car over while staring at Chippy. We cut to Bingo spying, seeing Sparky wheeling the empty wheelbarrow back to the backyard while vocalizing a rock song.
Bingo: Oh no! 
Cut to Bluey spying on Chippy's phone call, still hiding behind her toy car.
Chippy: Cherry, you're not letting me explain. 
Sparky walks up to Bluey while still vocalizing a rock song. He quickly spots Bluey behind the toy car.
Sparky: Oh, hey kid. 
Bluey: Ah!
Bluey runs off screaming whilst Bingo barks at him.
Sparky: Haha, little tackers. 
Bluey and Bingo run back to Chilli, who is back to working from home.
Bluey: Mum! We found out who Chocolate Milk is texting. 
Chilli: Oh, good one. 
Bluey: It's a girl called Cherry.
That catches Chilli's attention, causing her to stop working and listen to Bluey's news about Chippy.
Chilli: Oh. Really?
Bluey and Bingo nod.
Chippy: No, Cherry.
We see Bluey and Bingo's POV. The saluki woman earlier, Cherry, is there in her car talking to Chippy. She does not seem happy with Chippy.
Bluey: Is that Cherry? 
Chippy says something muffled, which makes Cherry look down sadly.
Bingo: Maybe. But they look like enemies.
Cherry says something back to Chippy, and of course, it's muffled. She looks annoyedly at Chippy now.
Bluey: Yeah, they do. 
Chippy says something to Cherry, who looks at Chippy with a deadpan expression.
Bingo: Why would you phone call your enemy? 
Chilli pops up next to Bluey and Bingo without them noticing.
Chilli: Maybe they had an argument and he's trying to say sorry.
BOTH: Hey!
Chilli: Oh. Uh. I mean... time for dinner! 
We cut to the night sky turning into daytime in a timelapse. The episode's soundtrack comes in and plays over this. The truck pulls up again, but this time Chippy and Sparky both exit the truck.
Bluey: Look! Chocolate Milks coming in Big Belt's car this morning. 
Bingo: But where's Cherry?
Bluey: I don't know. 
Sparky is seen eating an apple, whilst Chippy puts up more rocks. We cut to a long shot of Bluey and Bingo's hiding space. Bingo is seen spying on the tradies while Bluey is seen drawing on a post. Her drawing includes pictures of Sparky, Chippy and Cherry. 
Bingo: Big Belt's eating an apple! 
Bluey: Ooh, okay. 
She draws an apple with red chalk next to Sparky.
Bingo: He said he really wants to eat a pie. But, someone called 'Me Missus' won't let him.
Bluey draws a pie with lines coming from it, appearing freshly baked.
Bluey: Me Missus? Maybe that's Big Belt's enemy! 
Bluey crosses out the pie.
Bluey: What else did you spy? 
Bingo: Well, Chocolate Milk found a dead toad and threw it at Big Belt. 
Bluey draws a toad near Chippy.
Bingo: Big Belt's cousin fell off a fishing boat, but he was okay. And Chocolate Milk isn't allowed to drive his car. 
Bluey draws a boat next to Sparky. Chilli peeks down into the space.
Chilli: Did Cherry call?
Bingo: No. Big Belt did one phone call where he yelled at someone about bricks. 
Chilli: Oh. Okay. 
Bingo: He called them the word you said when the dishwasher broke.
Chilli: Oh dear. 
Bluey: These enemies are very confusing! 
A typical ice cream truck melody plays, indicating the arrival of an ice cream truck. Bluey and Bingo gasp as they that realize the ice cream truck has pulled up.
Bingo: Ice cream?
We cut to Sparky and Chippy digging more. The music builds up to a fully orchestrated song.
Chippy: Ice cream? 
We see a split screen, where we see all four of them. Bluey and Bingo on the top, Chippy and Sparky at the bottom.
ALL: Ice cream! 
The scene with Sparky and Chippy cuts, where it shows only Bluey and Bingo.
BOTH: Can we have one?! 
Chilli: Nope. 
The both of them scream and fall over. The happy theme that was building up slowly winds back down to just the normal ice cream truck melody. We cut to Sparky getting two ice creams from the ice cream vendor while Chippy texts on his phone.
Ice-cream Lady: You got them? 
Sparky: Yep. 
Bingo: He's getting sprinkles...
Ice-cream Lady: Thanks fellows. 
Chippy's phone rings, amd he picks it up. He walks off to the centre of the cul-de-sac.
Chippy: Hey, Cherry. No, I can talk. 
Sparky looks down disappointedly. He looks around, glancing over at the girls briefly.
Sparky: I wonder if anyone wants this spare ice cream?
Bingo gasps and runs off to go get the ice cream from Sparky.
Bluey: Bingo! 
Bingo: Me, me, me! 
We cut to Sparky, Bluey and Bingo sitting on the sidewalk. Bluey and Bingo are sitting far from Sparky. Bluey and Bingo are taking turns licking.
Bluey: Does 'Me Missus' know you're eating ice cream? 
Sparky: Who? 
Bingo: Me Missus. We know he doesn't let you eat pies.
Sparky: Oh. Me Missus. You mean Jules! She's my wife. 
Sparky takes a bite from his ice cream.
Bluey: Oh. So she's not your enemy. 
Sparky: Well, not usually. Hey, hang on, have you been spying on us?
Sparky gives the girls a knowing look.
Bingo: Yes. Cause your our enemy.
Sparky: Really? How come? 
Bluey: You're digging up our grass. 
Sparky: Oh yeah, I guess we are. My kids like to spy too. What else did you find out?
Bluey: We know all about your boat. 
Bingo: And that Cherry is Chocolate Milk's enemy. 
Sparky: Chocolate Milk? Ah, you mean Chippy. Yeah well, I guess he and Cherry are enemies at the moment. But they're trying to be friends again. 
We see Chippy, walking around while talking on the phone.
Bluey: Oh. 
Sparky: You kids are good spies.
Bluey: Really?
Sparky: Oh yeah. 
Bluey: Thanks. 
Sparky takes the last bites of his ice cream. The three watch Chippy talking to Cherry on the phone.
Sparky: Do you think enemies can ever become friends? 
Bluey: Hm... maybe! 
Chilli is seen on the porch of the house, arms akimbo. Bluey and Bingo scream.
Chilli: Are you guys eating ice cream?! 
Sparky: Oh, sorry Chilli. That was me. 
Chilli: Still three days, Sparky? 
Sparky: Yep, yep. Four at the most. 
Chilli gives Sparky a suspicious look before walking back into the house.
Chilli: Okay.
Sparky: I'll tell you what, I wouldn't want to be your mum's enemy. Good chatting with you. I guess we'll go back to being enemies now. 
Sparky gets up and walks off to get back to work. Before he does, he straightens the post box, which was bumped into in the last episode.
Bluey: Um, yeah. 
We cut to Sparky working again, he appears to be looking around for something. The episode's theme starts building up again.
Sparky: Hey, Chippy! Where's the tape measure? 
He sees Chippy on his phone once again.
Sparky: Ah, not again. 
Bluey sees Sparky continuing to look around for the tape measure, so she gets up to go help him secretly.
Sparky: Where is that tape measure? 
A thump is heard, and Sparky hears it. He looks over to see and spots the tape measure, laying on the grass.
Sparky: How about that? 
Night makes way for daytime again, while the episode's theme reaches its peak again. Chippy and Sparky get out the truck once again. This time, Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli are spying on them from the porch. The three look at each other. We then cut to the two tradies drilling wood in place. Sparky wipes his head and looks down.
Sparky: Oh... 
He spots a pie with a tomato sauce smile on a mushroom table right next to the pond.
Sparky: Your kidding! 
He runs over to the pie, and eats it.
Sparky: Oh, man. 
Bluey and Bingo are shown, spying on Sparky eating the pie, smiling at him. Bluey is seen drawing more, amongst many other drawings added to the original. Since we last saw the drawing, now a man racing a horse, some waves were added to the boat, what is presumably Sparky's cousin with a microphone, a bottle of chocolate milk, a fish with a hook, a shark fin, two small dogs shouting, a keg of beer, a cricket paddle with a ball and a tiger were added to it.
Bingo: Bluey, come quick! I think they finished! 
Bluey: What?! 
The two run over to see the finished fish pond. Sparky is seen putting some tools in a toolbox while Chippy walks off. The two are amazed at how the fish pond turned out.
Sparky: Hey kids, what do you reckon? 
They walk closer to examine it. We see close ups of the pond with its features shown: A small waterfall flowing, lily pads, and a rock in the water,
BOTH: It's amazing.
We cut to the evening sky, panning down to show the tradies leaving.
Bluey: Thank you for our fish pond! We love it! 
Sparky: You're welcome. 
Chilli: And you did it in three days! 
Sparky: Well, I work better on a full stomach. 
Sparky pats his stomach. Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Chilli: He did well, too.
They all look over to see Chippy on the phone again, talking to Cherry.
Sparky: Yep. Kid can work hard when he wants to.
Chippy: Yep.
Sparky: Okay, see you later. 
The Heelers wave goodbye to Sparky as he gets into his truck.
ALL: Bye! 
Sparky: See ya, Chippy. 
Chilli: Oh... is Chocolate Milk-- I mean Chippy not going with you? 
Sparky: Nope. He's got a lift. 
Sparky drives off, revealing Chippy and Cherry hugging each other. Bluey, Bingo and Chilli gasp at this. Chippy and Sparky stop hugging and Chippy waves goodbye to the Heelers. Sparky drives off while honking. Chippy and Cherry get in the car. The episode ends with the credits. Instead of Bluey dancing, we see Sparky's tape measure.
