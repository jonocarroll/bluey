Bluey: Huh? Who's that? 
Bingo: And who is that? 
Bluey: Ah! Enemies! Bark at them! 
Bluey: It's not working! Run! 
Chilli: I'm working from home this week, so yell if you need me.
Sparky: No worries, Chilli. 
Bluey: He knows Mum's name. 
Chilli: And you're sure it'll only take three days?
Sparky: Yeah, three or four. 
Chilli: Is it three or is it four? 
Bingo: What will be three or four?
Bluey: I don't know! 
Bluey: Psst, Mum! 
Chilli: Huh?
Bluey: Down here. 
Chilli: Oh, hey girls. 
Bluey: Who are they?!
Bingo: And why are they painting our grass?! 
Chilli: They're tradies. They're putting in a fishpond. 
Bluey: When are they leaving?
Chilli: Well, they said three days, but now I'm not so sure. Keep an eye on them for me, alright? Make sure they're working hard. 
BOTH: Okay! 
Bluey: Bingo! 
Bingo: Yes?
Bluey: We're going to spy on the tradies. 
Bingo: Uss. 
Bluey (reading): This episode of Bluey is called Tradies. 
Sparky: It just needs the hole fixed up and a new outlook. 
Bluey: All he does is talk about his boat! 
Sparky: I don't know. What's going on?
Chippy: I'm just going to the truck. 
Sparky: Alrighty, don't be long. We've got a lot to do. 
Bingo: Where's Chocolate Milk going? 
Bluey: I don't know. I'll follow him. You watch Big Belt. 
Bluey: Hmm, he's on his phone. 
Sparky: Oi. 
Chippy: Oh, sorry boss.
Bluey: And then Big Belt called Chocolate Milk that word Dad said when the mower didn't start. 
Chilli: Oh dear. Are they working hard? 
Bingo: Chocolate Milk isn't. He's on his phone all the time! 
Bluey: Yeah. Big Belt does not like it. 
Chilli: Neither do I, I want that pond done in three days. 
Bingo: Do you think Big Belt and Chocolate Milk are enemies? 
Bluey: Yes. And both of them are our enemies. 
Chilli: I wonder who he's texting. 
Bluey: Ooh. We can find out! 
Sparky: Oi, back to work. Not here for a haircut, Chippy. 
Bluey: Okay, he's phone calling. 
Bluey: I'm going to get closer. 
Bingo: I'll watch Big Belt. 
Chippy: I didn't say that. 
Chippy: I did say that, but I didn't mean it though. 
Bingo: Oh no! 
Chippy: Cherry, you're not letting me explain. 
Sparky: Oh, hey kid. 
Bluey: Ah!
Sparky: Haha, little tackers. 
Bluey: Mum! We found out who Chocolate Milk is texting. 
Chilli: Oh, good one. 
Bluey: It's a girl called Cherry.
Chilli: Oh. Really?
Chippy: No, Cherry.
Bluey: Is that Cherry? 
Bingo: Maybe. But they look like enemies.
Bluey: Yeah, they do. 
Bingo: Why would you phone call your enemy? 
Chilli: Maybe they had an argument and he's trying to say sorry.
BOTH: Hey!
Chilli: Oh. Uh. I mean... time for dinner! 
Bluey: Look! Chocolate Milks coming in Big Belt's car this morning. 
Bingo: But where's Cherry?
Bluey: I don't know. 
Bingo: Big Belt's eating an apple! 
Bluey: Ooh, okay. 
Bingo: He said he really wants to eat a pie. But, someone called 'Me Missus' won't let him.
Bluey: Me Missus? Maybe that's Big Belt's enemy! 
Bluey: What else did you spy? 
Bingo: Well, Chocolate Milk found a dead toad and threw it at Big Belt. 
Bingo: Big Belt's cousin fell off a fishing boat, but he was okay. And Chocolate Milk isn't allowed to drive his car. 
Chilli: Did Cherry call?
Bingo: No. Big Belt did one phone call where he yelled at someone about bricks. 
Chilli: Oh. Okay. 
Bingo: He called them the word you said when the dishwasher broke.
Chilli: Oh dear. 
Bluey: These enemies are very confusing! 
Bingo: Ice cream?
Chippy: Ice cream? 
ALL: Ice cream! 
BOTH: Can we have one?! 
Chilli: Nope. 
Ice-cream Lady: You got them? 
Sparky: Yep. 
Bingo: He's getting sprinkles...
Ice-cream Lady: Thanks fellows. 
Chippy: Hey, Cherry. No, I can talk. 
Sparky: I wonder if anyone wants this spare ice cream?
Bluey: Bingo! 
Bingo: Me, me, me! 
Bluey: Does 'Me Missus' know you're eating ice cream? 
Sparky: Who? 
Bingo: Me Missus. We know he doesn't let you eat pies.
Sparky: Oh. Me Missus. You mean Jules! She's my wife. 
Bluey: Oh. So she's not your enemy. 
Sparky: Well, not usually. Hey, hang on, have you been spying on us?
Bingo: Yes. Cause your our enemy.
Sparky: Really? How come? 
Bluey: You're digging up our grass. 
Sparky: Oh yeah, I guess we are. My kids like to spy too. What else did you find out?
Bluey: We know all about your boat. 
Bingo: And that Cherry is Chocolate Milk's enemy. 
Sparky: Chocolate Milk? Ah, you mean Chippy. Yeah well, I guess he and Cherry are enemies at the moment. But they're trying to be friends again. 
Bluey: Oh. 
Sparky: You kids are good spies.
Bluey: Really?
Sparky: Oh yeah. 
Bluey: Thanks. 
Sparky: Do you think enemies can ever become friends? 
Bluey: Hm... maybe! 
Chilli: Are you guys eating ice cream?! 
Sparky: Oh, sorry Chilli. That was me. 
Chilli: Still three days, Sparky? 
Sparky: Yep, yep. Four at the most. 
Chilli: Okay.
Sparky: I'll tell you what, I wouldn't want to be your mum's enemy. Good chatting with you. I guess we'll go back to being enemies now. 
Bluey: Um, yeah. 
Sparky: Hey, Chippy! Where's the tape measure? 
Sparky: Ah, not again. 
Sparky: Where is that tape measure? 
Sparky: How about that? 
Sparky: Oh... 
Sparky: Your kidding! Oh, man. 
Bingo: Bluey, come quick! I think they finished! 
Bluey: What?! 
Sparky: Hey kids, what do you reckon? 
BOTH: It's amazing.
Bluey: Thank you for our fish pond! We love it! 
Sparky: Your welcome. 
Chilli: And you did it in three days! 
Sparky: Well, I work better on a full stomach. 
Chilli: He did well, too.
Sparky: Yep. Kid can work hard when he wants to. Okay, see you later. 
ALL: Bye! 
Sparky: See ya, Chippy. 
Chilli: Oh... is Chocolate Milk-- I mean Chippy not going with you? 
Sparky: Nope. He's got a lift.
