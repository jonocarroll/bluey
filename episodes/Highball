The short starts with the title card: Highball. There's a rugby ball on top of the title. We then cut to a shot of Pat's yard, where some shirts can be seen drying on a drying rack. We then cut to a shot of Bluey, Lucky and Pat in a backyard. Bluey and Lucky are giggline to each other about something Pat tries to teach them something.
Pat: Alright kids. Come stand around here.
Bluey and Lucky walk a bit closer towards Pat. Pat motions them to come closer.
Pat: Closer, closer.
Lucky takes a few steps closer to Pat until he is halted.
Pat: Not that close.
Lucky takes a few steps back right next to Bluey.
Pat: Alright, I'm gonna show ya how to put up a highball.
The pups nod. Pat prepares to kick the ball, getting into position.
Pat: What you wanna do, hold the ball...
Bluey sticks her tongue out, Lucky notices and looks at her.
Pat: Hang on, I'm just gonna stretch out a bit.
The two giggle as Pat stretches, unaware of their mucking around. Lucky puffs out his cheeks and giggles along with Bluey.
Pat: Hammy is strong.
Bluey and Lucky keep giggling, Pat hears them.
Pat: C'mon, let's crack on.
The two stop laughing and pay attention.
Pat: Alright, so what you wanna do...
Bluey taps on Lucky on the shoulder, making him look around to see who did it. He squints his eyes suspiciously at Bluey, who returns a sheepish look.
Pat: Bring your foot up to the ball.
Pat brings his foot to the ball, preparing to kick it. Pat continues his demonstration, unaware the pups' attention has been divided again. Bluey and Lucky giggle quietly at their silly antics, wagging their tails.
Pat: Not going for distance here, we're going for height.
Pat notices that the pups aren't listening.
Pat: Are you guys watching?
Bluey and Lucky: Yes!
Pat: Alright, Lucky mate, mate, c'mon.
The two pups keep giggling, trying to pay attention again. It takes them a few seconds to finally quiet down.
Pat: Bluey, you pay attention too.
Bluey nods her head and the two start watching Pat again. Pat returns to his demonstration, about to kick the ball again.
Pat: So hold it a bit like this, look at the ball...
Pat finally kicks the ball up in the air.
Pat: And give it one of these!
Bluey starts running away, with Lucky following her not far behind. Pat puts his arms on his hips and closes his eyes, unaware that the pups left him. He opens his eyes and finds that they're gone.
Pat: Kids?
The ball suddenly comes back down and bonks Pat on the head, knocking him to the ground. Pat groans and rubs his head where the ball hit him. Pat grabs his leg and rubs it.
Pat: Oh, me hammy... 
The short ends with the Bluey logo popping in, accompanied by the shorts theme.
