The episode opens on a shot of Bandit, sitting in the car in the driveway. His eyes are closed, and he is holding a clipboard. He exhales slowly, then opens his eyes.
Bandit: (quietly) "Today's the day, Hugo. You're going to sell this house."
Behind him, Chilli walks down the front path.
Bandit: (quietly) "You can do it! Nothing else matters."
He spots Chilli and gets out of the car, smiling.
Bandit: "Hello, Monique. Lovely day, isn't it?"
He holds out his hand for a handshake. Chilli looks skeptical, but shakes his hand.
Chilli: "I guess so."
Bandit: "So you're looking to buy a house?"
Chilli: "Yes, I am. Are you the house-selling person?"
Bandit: "Yes. And have I got the perfect house for you! Ta-da!"
He spreads his hands theatrically, indicating the Heelers' house. The camera lingers on the house in silence, long enough to be awkward.
Chilli: "It's a bit small."
Bandit: (awkwardly) "It's bigger inside."
TITLE CARD - Ghostbasket
Bluey: (as Janet) "This episode of Bluey is called: Ghostbasket."
Bandit and Chilli climb up the front steps. Bandit gestures to the porch.
Bandit: "Notice the lovely period floorboards?"
Chilli: "Hmm. Is anyone living here at the moment?"
Bandit: "Yes, but they're not home."
Bandit opens the front door, revealing Bluey and Bingo in costume as Janet and Rita.
Bluey, Bingo: (as grannies) "Aaaah!"
Bluey and Bingo charge towards the door. Bandit slams it shut, and a moment later, two objects impact the door.
Chilli: "Is everything okay?"
Bandit: "Uh, I'll be right back."
Bandit opens the door partway, and slips through it sideways.
He confronts the grannies in the entrance.
Bandit: (whispering) "What are you doing here? You said you'd be at lawn bowls."
Bluey: (as Janet) "Phyllis had to cancel."
Bingo: (as Rita) "Yeah, she went water-skiing."
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "Well, beat it, ya old fossils! I'm trying to sell this place."
Bingo: (as Rita) "We don't want you to sell this place."
Bluey: (as Janet) "Yeah."
Bandit pinches the bridge of his nose.
Bandit: "Look, we've been through this. It's not up to me. Your kids are sticking you in an old codgers home, and they told me to sell it."
Bluey: (as Janet) "Those cheeky kids."
Bandit: "If you've got a problem, take it up with them. But please, let me get on with my job."
Bluey: (as Janet)(sadly) "But we've lived in this house for fifty years."
Bandit: "No, you haven't! You won it in a raffle at the surf club last April."
Bluey, Bingo: (as grannies) "Did we?"
Bandit: "Yes. Look, just stay out of my way, okay?"
Bluey, Bingo: (as grannies)"Okay, love. We will."
Bluey and Bingo giggle as Bandit goes back out the front door.
Back on the front porch, Bandit clears his throat.
Bandit: "Ahem. Please come in."
Bandit opens the door again. This time, there are no grannies visible.
Cut to the entryway. Bandit peeks in the front door, before opening it wide and leading Chilli inside. Bluey and Bingo's feet are visible behind the armchair near the door.
Bandit: "So, here we have a lovely period—"
Bluey and Bingo shriek and tackle Chilli to the floor. Bluey is armed with a bubble shooter and Bingo is armed with a grabber claw.
Bluey, Bingo: (as grannies)"Get out! Out! Out!"
Chilli: "Get 'em off me!"
Bandit: "Don't look 'em in the eye!"
Bandit waves a packet of biscuits, getting the grannies' attention, then throws it. Bluey and Bingo get off Chilli and chase after the biscuits.
Bingo: (as Rita) "Oh, biscuits."
Chilli: "What was that?"
Bandit helps Chilli up, as Bluey and Bingo pretend to devour the packet of biscuits.
Bandit: "Nothing. Uh, let's just check out the kitchen, shall we?"
Bandit pulls Chilli out of the room.
They enter the kitchen, with Bandit shoving Chilli in front of him. He hastily points at the features of the room.
Bandit: "Uh, oven. Stove. Fridge. Uh, you got some drawers. They can open and shut."
He opens and shuts a drawer. Chilli feels the countertop appreciatively.
Bandit tries to shove her to the next room.
Bandit: "Alrighty. On to the living room."
Chilli turns away, back to the kitchen counter.
Chilli: "Well, hey, hang on, I like these worktops. Is this silky oak?"
Bingo: (offscreen)(as Rita) "Here comes the grannies!"
Bluey and Bingo charge into the room, driving the pedal car. Bandit jumps in the way, blocking them from getting to Chilli.
Bandit: "NO!"
Chilli shugs. Bandit continues to struggle with Bluey and Bingo, trying to block Chilli's view of the pedal car.
Chilli: "Okay. I was just asking."
Bandit: (strained) "Uh, why don't you check out the spacious dining room? I'll be right back."
He pushes the pedal car into the living room.
Bandit: "What do you think you're doing?"
Bingo: (as Rita) "We told you."
Bluey: (as Janet) "You're not selling our house."
Bandit: "Look, relax. I don't think she's interested anyway."
Chilli walks in.
Chilli: "I'm interested."
Bluey, Bingo: (as grannies) "Aaaah!"
They shriek and charge at Chilli in the pedal car. Bandit holds them back.
Bandit: "No! Bad grannies!"
Chilli squats down to get a better look at them.
Chilli: "Oh, and who is this?"
Bluey and Bingo exit the pedal car. Bandit scratches the back of his head.
Bandit: "Oh, uh, this is..."
Bluey: (as Janet)(angrily) "Rita and Janet.
Bingo: (as Rita)(angrily) "And this is our house."
Bingo stomps her foot for emphasis.
Chilli: (cheerfully) "Not for long. I think I want to buy it."
Bluey, Bingo: (as grannies) "What!?"
Bandit: "Really?"
Bluey whispers inaudibly to Bingo. Bingo giggles and runs off into the kitchen.
Bluey: (as Janet) "Well, dearie, has he told you about the—"
Bandit puts his hands over her mouth. Bluey continues trying to talk while Bandit talks over her.
Bandit: "Custom fittings in the ensuite? No, but I can if you like."
Chilli: "Don't worry about it. I'm ready to buy it. I haven't seen a single thing that would put me off."
Ghostly Moan: (offscreen) "Whoooooooo!"
Bandit: "Oh, no."
Chilli: "What was that?"
Bandit: "Nothing."
Bandit lets go of Bluey.
Bandit: (nervously) "Um, let's go and see the bedrooms."
Chilli: "No, I definitely heard something."
Bluey: (as Janet) "That's just Ghostbasket."
Chilli: "Ghost... What?"
Bandit: "Ghost nothing!"
Bingo enters from the kitchen, scooting along under a laundry basket.
Bingo: (as Rita)(as Ghostbasket) "Whoooooooo!"
Bandit: "Aah! Come on, let's go check out the sunroom."
He gets between Chilli and the basket, and hurries her out of the room. Bluey follows, giggling.
They enter the sun room.
Bingo: (as Rita)(as Ghostbasket)(offscreen) "Whoooooooo!"
Bandit: "Uh, this is the sunroom."
He closes the doors behind them as Chilli looks around. He leans against the doors, which shake as something bumps against the other side.
Bandit: "Here's the room. And, uh, there's the sun."
Chilli: "Look, I really think I heard something back there."
The moaning and bumping stop.
Bluey: (as Janet) "You did!"
Bandit: "You didn't!"
Bandit throws open the doors, revealing an empty hallway.
Bandit: "See? Nothing."
Bingo, as Ghostbasket, enters the sunroom from the other door.
Bingo: (as Rita)(as Ghostbasket) "Whoooooooo!"
Bandit: "Argh! Bathroom!"
He shoves Chilli out of the room. Bluey follows after them, giggling.
Cut to a shot of the hallway outside Bluey and Bingo's bedroom. Four open doors are visible - on the left foreground, a room with blue walls and in the background, the spare bedroom. On the right, Bluey and Bingo's bedroom in the background and a room with yellow walls in the foreground. A kazoo arrangement of the grannies theme plays as Ghostbasket chases them from door to door at a reduced frame rate.
Bandit shoves Chilli from the blue room to the yellow room, followed by Bluey, and then Bingo as Ghostbasket a moment later. Then, Bandit runs from the girl's bedroom to the spare bedroom, dragging Chilli behind him. Chilli, unconcerned, admires the fretwork vents above the doors. Bluey follows, and again, Bingo follows a moment later. Bandit drags Chilli from the blue room towards the yellow room - then turns around and hustles her back to the blue room as Ghostbasket emerges from the yellow room and chases after them.
Bandit opens the door of the large bathroom and shoves Chilli inside. Bluey follows them.
Bandit: (exhausted) "Please take in this colonial-style bathroom."
Bingo: (as Rita)(as Ghostbasket) "Whoooooo!"
Bandit slams the door before Bingo can enter.
Bandit: "Agh!"
Ghostbasket bumps into the door.
Chilli: "Ooh, very nice."
Bingo: (as Rita)(as Ghostbasket)(offscreen) "Whoooooooo!"
Bandit: "Okay, let's get going. Uh...
He looks around, then opens the window.
Bandit: "...out this original heritage window."
He motions for Chilli to jump out the window.
Chilli: "But we're on the second floor."
Bandit: "Try not to land on the well-landscaped garden."
Chilli: "I am not jumping out of a window."
Bingo: (as Rita)(as Ghostbasket)(offscreen) "Whoooooooo!"
Ghostbasket bumps against the door repeatedly.
Chilli: "What keeps making that sound?"
Bluey: (as Janet) "Ghostbasket."
Bandit: "Janet!"
Bandit waves his hands at her, signalling "stop."
Chilli: "Huh?"
Bluey: (as Janet) "Ghostbasket comes with the house."
Bingo: (as Rita)(as Ghostbasket)(offscreen) "Whoooooooo!"
Bluey: (as Janet) "And I have to warn you, he doesn't like young people."
Chilli puts her hands on her hips.
Chilli: "Hugo?"
Bandit: "Look, it's true, the house is haunted by a Ghostbasket. I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier, I just really wanted to sell this place."
Bingo: (as Rita)(as Ghostbasket)(offscreen) "Whoooooooo!"
Bluey: (as Janet) "Liar, liar. Pants on fire."
Chilli: "Let's get to the bottom of this."
Ghostbasket thumps against the door as Chilli goes to open it.
Bandit: "Argh! No!"
Bandit dives into the bathtub.
Rita, under a laundry basket, scoots into the bathroom.
Bingo: (as Rita)(as Ghostbasket) "Whoooooooo!"
Bingo bumps into Chilli's foot. She giggles. Chilli picks up the laundry basket.
Chilli: "Here's your Ghostbasket."
Bingo: (as Rita) "Oh. Hello, love."
Bandit peeks over the lip of the bathtub.
Bandit: "Huh?"
Bluey: (as Janet) "Oh, Rita! What?"
Chilli carries the laundry basket out of the room. Bandit climbs out of the tub.
Bandit: "Wait a minute. You're Ghostbasket?"
Bingo: (as Rita) "Yep."
Bingo giggles.
Bandit: "I've been trying to sell this house for six weeks, but every single buyer has been scared away by Ghostbasket — and it was you all along!"
Bluey: (as Janet) "Oh, Rita, how could you?"
Bandit grabs Bluey by the waist and holds her upside down, shaking her around. She laughs and drops her coin purse, spilling coins on the floor.
Bandit: "Come here! This is your doing, wasn't it?"
Bingo shoots Bandit in the back with her bubble launcher.
Bingo: (as Rita) "We don't want to leave!"
Bluey: (as Janet) "You won't sell this house!"
Chilli: "I'll take it." 
Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo freeze.
Bandit, Bluey, Bingo: "Huh?"
Bandit: "Really?"
Chilli: "Yep."
Bluey and Bingo: (as grannies) "No!"
Chilli: "Just get those grannies out and we've got a deal."
Cut to a shot of a blue sky. Bandit's tosses Bluey and Bingo through the frame.
Cut to the front lawn. Bandit dusts his hands, as Bluey and Bingo lay on the lawn.
Bluey: (as Janet) "Ow, my bottom."
Bingo: (as Rita) "Oh, dear."
Chilli: "And here's your money."
Chilli pantomimes handing Bandit something.
Chilli: "Thanks."
Chilli turns around and walks into the house. Bandit pumps his arms in celebration as the music swells triumphantly.
Bandit: "I did it. I sold it! I sold it! Whoo-hoo-hoo! I'm the be—"
Bandit spots Bluey and Bingo sitting, dejected, on the lawn. He freezes mid-celebration as the music cuts out.
Bandit: "Look, it's nothing personal."
Bluey: (as Janet) "Oh, yes, we know. It's just your job."
Bandit: "She seems like a nice lady."
Chilli leans out of the bay window.
Chilli: *angrily* "GET THOSE GRANNIES OFF MY LAWN!"
She slams the window.
Bandit: "Well. Maybe not."
Bluey stands, and helps Bingo up.
Bluey: (as Janet) "Upsy-daisy, Rita."
Bingo: (as Rita) "Thanks, Janet."
Bluey: (as Janet) "Come on. I guess we'll have to walk to the old grannies home."
Bingo: (as Rita) "Pardon?"
Bluey: (as Janet) "I SAID we'll have to WALK!"
Bingo: (as Rita) "Oh, just some baked beans, love."
Bluey: (as Janet)(to Bandit) "Bye-bye."
Bluey and Bingo walk down the lawn. Cut to a close up on Bandit's face, as he sadly watches them walk away.
Bandit: (resigned) "Wait."
Bluey, Bingo: (as grannies) "Huh?"
Bandit sighs, then walks down the lawn to Bandit and Bluey.
Bandit: "For once in your life, do exactly what I say."
Cut to the back yard. Chilli is reclining on a lawn chair.
Chilli: "Ahhhh. Home ownership."
Ghostly Moan: (offscreen) "Whooooo-oooo!"
Chilli looks over to the shed. Bandit is hiding under an overturned wheelbarrow, crawling forward.
Bandit: (as Ghostbarrow) "Whooooo-oooo!"
Chilli: (sarcastically) "Oh, no! It's a ghost wheelbarrow. Whatever shall I do?"
Bandit: (as Ghostbarrow) "Whooooo-oooo! Get out."
Chilli gets up and walks towards the wheelbarrow.
Chilli: (sarcastically) "Oh, yes. Of course. I best get out of this house and never come back, because that's definitely a ghost wheelbarrow and not just a couple of old..."
Chilli grabs the wheelbarrow and is about to turn it over, when Bluey and Bingo walk up.
Bluey, Bingo: (as grannies) "Hello, love."
Chilli: (faintly) "...grannies?"
Bluey picks up Jeremy the garden gnome.
Bluey: (as Janet) "We just forgot Jeremy. So sorry. We'll be out of your hair now."
Chilli: (slowly) "But if you're there, then that means this is actually a..."
Bandit jostles the wheelbarrow.
Bandit: (as Ghostbarrow) "Whooooo-oooo!"
Chilli backs away.
Chilli: "...GHOST WHEELBARROW! "Waaaaahhh!"
Chilli runs out of the back yard. Bluey and Bingo throw their arms up in celebration, dropping Jeremy.''
Bluey, Bingo: (as grannies) "Hooray!"
Bandit crawls out from under the wheelbarrow.
Bandit: "Did it work?" 
Bluey and Bingo run up and hug him.
Bluey: (as Janet) "Yes!"
Bluey, Bingo: (as grannies) "Thank you, young man."
Bandit: "No worries."
Cut to the front lawn. Chilli runs down the steps, still screaming.
Bandit: "But look. I can't do this every time."
Chilli runs out of frame. The camera pulls back, revealing a real For Sale sign in front of the Heelers' house.
The last note of the episode theme fades out, leaving the end credits silent. No animation is played during the credits.
