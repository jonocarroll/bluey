The episode opens in front of the Golden Crown takeaway restaurant at dusk. It's a small Chinese restaurant in a strip mall. A single table and chair sit on the sidewalk in front of it. A car engine approaches, and headlights illuminate the side of the restaurant.
TITLE CARD: Takeaway
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Takeaway."
Bluey runs in from screen left. Bandit follows, looking worn out. Bingo follows a little behind him. Bluey points at a tap on the side of the building.
Bluey: "Ooh, can I have a shower under that tap?"
Bandit: "No. Wet. Dogs. In. Car."
Bluey slumps.
Bluey: "Aww!"
Bingo stops and examines the pavement.
Bingo: "Daaaad?"
Bandit: "Yeah, mate."
Bingo: "Where do rocks come from?"
Bandit: "Uhhh..."
Bluey: "Can we have some of your takeaway, too?"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bandit: "You girls don't like spicy."
Bingo: "Ooh, I like spicy."
Bandit: "You squirts wait here. I'll be two seconds."
Bandit walks into the restaurant. Through the shop window, he can be seen talking to the takeaway lady. The moment he's gone, Bluey and Bingo make eye contact, and then both try to sit on the chair at the same time.
Bluey: "Raaah!"
Bluey gets there first, but Bingo is able to squirm in behind her. They both giggle. Bingo tries to push Bluey off, but Bluey shoves her whole body backwards, pushing Bingo off the chair.
A car passes by. A newspaper blows off the table. Bingo yips and runs to retrieve it. She picks it up in her mouth, and presents it to Bluey, tail wagging. Bluey puts it back on the table and pats Bingo's head. Bingo giggles.
Bandit emerges from the restaurant with a plastic bag.
Bandit: "Alright! Let's boogie."
Bandit looks in his bag. Bluey gets up.
Bluey: "Yeah!"
Bingo: "Let's boogie."
The kids turn to leave.
Bandit: "Hang about!"
Bandit turns to go back into the restaurant.
Bandit: (firmly) "Stay."
Bandit goes into the restaurant and talks to the takeaway lady. The kids make eye contact, and resume the struggle for the chair, giggling. Bluey gets there first. Bingo climbs on in front of her and tries to shove her off. Bluey gets her legs between them and pushes Bingo off. Bluey laughs and blows a raspberry. Bingo looks offended for a moment, then blows a raspberry right back. They both giggle."
Bandit comes out of the restaurant and shoos Bluey off the chair.
Bandit: "Five more minutes, kids."
He puts the takeaway bag on the table and sits down.
Bandit: "They forgot the spring rolls!"
He takes out his cell phone and makes a call. Chilli's face is shown on the screen.
Chilli: "Hey, babe. What's up?"
Bandit puts down the phone and looks away.
Bluey & Bingo: "They forgot the spring rolls!"
Chilli: "Oh! Your dad and spring rolls!"
Bandit: "They're just cooking 'em now."
Chilli: "Forget 'em, babe. The kids must be starving."
Bandit: "Not. Leaving. Without. Spring rolls."
He picks up the phone.
Bandit: "Say 'See ya, Mum.'"
The wave to the phone.'
Bluey & Bingo: "See ya, Mum!"
Chilli: "Well, good luck."
Bandit hangs up.
Bandit: "Leave without the spring rolls? Is she crazy?"
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bingo: "How long is five minutes?"
Bandit: "Uh, it's one episode of 'Chutney Chimp.'"
Bluey: "What are we gonna play?"
Bandit: "We're gonna play Dad Reads The Newspaper."
Bandit opens the newspaper. Bluey looks into the restaurant, at a refrigerated case of drinks.
Bluey: "Ooh, can I buy a juice?"
Bingo looks at some menu items displayed on the shop window.
Bingo: "What do these words say?"
Bandit: "No idea, kiddo. And no. There's a tap over there if you're thirsty."
Bluey laughs and scampers over to the tap.
Bluey: "Please, can I have a shower in it?"
Bandit: "Don't even think about it."
Bluey tries to turn the tap with both hands. She grunts with effort, but she's turning the wrong way.
Bluey: "Dad, can you help me?"
Bandit tucks the newspaper under his arm and walks over to Bluey. Bingo follows, giggling. He opens the tap. Bluey drinks from the stream of water.
Bandit: "Do you need a drink, too, Bingo?"
Bingo: "No, I'm not thirsty."
She points at some weeds growing out of the drain under the tap.
Bingo: "Can I eat these plants?"
Bandit: "No, mate."
Bandit goes to sit back down. From off screen, the tap squeaks and the sound of water gets louder.
Bluey: "Aah! Ohh!"
He walks back over to the tap, which is now gushing water.
Bluey: "Which way do you turn it off?"
Bandit closes the tap. Bluey giggles and runs back towards the table.
Bingo: "Why are some plants food, like lettuce, but other plants aren't food?"
Bandit: "Uh, well..."
Bluey: "Dad, can I play with these?"
Bluey has moved the chair over by the door, and stood on it to get at the restaurant's menus. She waves two of them in the air.
Bandit: "Uh, just two, kid. The shop guys need 'em."
Bandit sets her down on the ground.
Bluey: "How about three?"
Bandit: "Two."
He moves the chair back to the table and starts to sit down.
Bingo: "Dad, I'm thirsty."
Bandit: "But I just— Oh, never mind."
He walks over and opens the tap. Bingo laps at the stream of water. A vehicle passes, and Bluey loses her grip on the menus, which blow into a puddle of water by the tap.
Bluey: "Aah!"
She runs over, but the menus are already soaked.
Bluey: "Aww!"
Bandit picks up the sodden menus.
Bandit: "Quickly, grab two more, but hang on to them."
The chair scrapes loudly as Bluey pushes it over to the menus and grabs two more, then pushes it back. Bandit puts the wet menus in the plastic bag.
Bingo: "Ohhh, I'm starving."
Bandit sits down and opens the newspaper.
Bingo: "Can I have some takeaway?"
Bluey: "Of course you can, customer. Welcome to my takeaway restaurant. Please, do sit down."
Bluey swats at Bandit's leg with the menus.
Bluey: "Up! Ssp-Ssp-Ssp! Get off!"
Bandit gets up, walks a few paces over, and sits down on the ground.
Bingo: "Oh, thank you."
Bingo climbs into the chair.
Bluey: "Here are some menus, Bingo."
She hands Bingo the menus.
Bluey: "You can have two, in case you want lots of food."
Bingo: "My name isn't Bingo. It's, uh..."
She looks around for inspiration. The tap drips.
Bingo: "...Tap Girl."
Bingo laughs.
Bluey runs over to Bandit and points at the newspaper.
Bluey: "Can I have this, Dad? I need to write Tap Girl's order down."
She grabs the newspaper and runs off with it. Long-suffering Bandit doesn't react. Bluey returns to the table, holding the newspaper like a pad of paper, and a chopstick for a pen.
Bluey: "So, Madam, what would you like?"
Bandit walks past them.
Bandit: "I'm just gonna check on the spring rolls."
Bingo: "I'll have some super-spicy, please."
Bluey: "Certainly. I'll just get that now."
Bluey reaches into the takeaway bag. She grabs the menus.
Bluey: "Yechh! Wet menu! Blegh!"
She tosses it in front of the door. She takes out a plastic container of food. The lid pops off and lands on the ground.
Bluey: "Ooh!"
Bingo: "Eeeee!"
Bingo picks up the container.
Bluey: "Uh, Tap Girl, I'm not sure you can eat it for real life."
Bingo: "But I'm hungry."
She scoops out of handful and eats it. Her pupils shrink. She dances from one foot to the other, fanning her mouth with her free hand.
Bingo: "Aah! Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah!"
She drops the container, spilling food on the ground.
Bingo: "Too spicy!"
Bandit walks out the door, looking disappointed.
Bandit: "Ah, they're not ready yet."
He spots the dropped food.
Bingo:' "Ooh, ooh, ooh!"
Bandit: "Hey! My dinner!"
He takes a step forward, and slips on the menu. 
Bandit: "Aaah!"
He catches himself on the back of the chair. Bingo spits out her partially chewed food, right in Bandit's face.
Bingo:' "Too spicy!"
Bandit wipes off his face and picks up Bingo.
Bandit: "Okay, okay, come here, mate."
He steps over the spilled food and takes her to the tap. He opens it, and holds her up to the stream of water to drink.
Bandit: "How's that, kiddo?"
While Bandit's busy, Bluey digs through the takeaway bag and comes up with some chopsticks.
Bingo:' "Good. But I need to do a wee. I'm busting."
Bandit: "Oh, man! Okay. Umm..."
Bluey walks back into shot, with chopsticks stuck under her upper lip, cliapping.
Bluey: "I'm a walrus."
Bandit runs to the front of the shop, carrying Bingo under his arm, and talks to the takeaway lady through the door.
Bandit: "Excuse me—" 
Bluey makes walrus noises. Bandit points at her.
Bandit: "Bluey, don't even think about it!" 
Bandit: (to Takeaway Lady) "Where's the nearest toilet? Oh, that's too far!"
He turns around. Bluey is still making walrus noises.
Bandit: "Bingo, can you hold on till we get home?"
Bingo: "I'm busting!"
Bandit: "Okay, okay. It's a bush wee."
He carries her over to a flowering bush in front of the shop, and holds her up for a bush wee. Bluey has gone silent.
Bingo: "Dad?"
Bandit: "Yeah, mate?"
Bingo: "Is everything in the whole world made of atoms?"
Bandit: "Uh, yeah, I think so."
Over by the tap, which is now gushing water, Bluey is panicking. The drain overflows onto the sidewalk.
Bluey: "Aaah! I can't turn it off!"
Bandit: "Bluey!"
Bluey: "I only meant to turn it on a little bit!"
The overflow reaches the edge of the sidewalks and begins pouring into the parking lot.
Bandit: "Don't even think about getting under that!"
Bluey: "There's water everywhere!"
Bandit: "Bingo, are you almost finished?"
Bingo: "Not yet. It's a long one."
A trio of crows descend on the table. Two of them peck at the spilled food, while a third pecks at the bag. Bandit waves his arm at them.
Bandit: "Get out of it!"
Bingo: "No, Mr Crow! It's too spicy for you!"
Bluey: "What will happen if we can never turn it off?!"
Bandit grabs the last of the menus from the box by the door, and throws them at the crows.
Bandit: "Get outta here!"
The menus, being paper, flutter to the ground far short of the crows.
Bluey: "The water will be up to the clouds!"
Bandit: "Are you finished yet, Bingo?"
Bingo: "Almost!"
Bluey: "Arghhh!"
Bandit: "This is a really long wee, Bingo!"
Bingo: "Finished!"
Bandit sets her down. He runs over to the table and shoos the crows away.
Bandit: "Get outta here!"
He runs over to the tap and turns it off.
Bluey: "Yeah!"
Bandit walks over to the chair and slumps down in the chair, closing his eyes. He groans loudly. Bluey and Bingo stare at him for a moment.
Bingo: "Dad?"
Bandit: "Yes, mate?"
Bingo: "If grown-ups grow from babies
and only grown-ups have babies, who had the first baby?"
Bandit opens his eyes and stares for a moment. He grabs the bag and stands up.
Bandit: "Okay, forget the spring rolls. Let's just get out of here."
He steps on the takeaway container lid and slips, falling over backwards. Three more takeaway containers spill all over him.
Bandit: "Whoa! Ooh!"
Bandit lies there and groans. The takeaway lady comes out of the shop with a tray of fortune cookies.
Takeaway Lady: "Sorry. Your spring rolls will be five more minutes."
Bingo: "What? That's a whole other 'Chutney Chimp.'"
Takeaway Lady: "Sorry about the wait. Would you kids like some fortune cookies?"
Bluey and Bingo both take a fortune cookie.
Bluey & Bingo: "Thank you."
Takeaway Lady: "What's happened out here?"
Bluey: "They're biscuits."
She breaks the fortune cookie in half.
Bingo: "With a little paper inside."
Bluey: "And writing on the paper."
Bandit is now sitting back on the chair, with the kids sitting on his knees. The mess has been cleaned up. Bluey hands Bandit her fortune.
Bluey: "What does it say?"
Bandit: "It says: 'Flowers may bloom again, but a person never has the chance to be young again.'"
Bandit looks surprised, and looks off into the distance.
Bluey: "What does that mean?"
Bandit thinks for a moment.
Bandit: "It means..."
He looks at the kids.
Bandit: "...it's shower time!"
He dumps the kids off his lap and jogs over to the tap.
Bluey: "For real life?"
He turns on the tap.
Bandit: "For real life."
Bluey and Bingo drop their fortune cookies and run over. They laugh and squeal as they splash around in the water. Bandit laughs too.
The takeaway lady comes out with another bag.
Takeaway Lady: "Spring rolls are ready!"
Bandit: "Oh, great! Just pop 'em on the table. Thanks."
Takeaway Lady: "No worries. Oh, that looks fun."
Bandit and the kids continue laughing. The takeaway lady walks back into the restaurant.
The episode theme, a lively fiddle tune, plays over the end credits as Bluey dances.
