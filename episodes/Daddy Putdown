Bingo: Look at those big muscles! 
Bandit: Sorry Bingo. You slipped.
Chilli: I'll see you in the morning, kids.
Bluey: I don't want you to go.
Chilli: I know sweetie, but Mummy has to go to a baby shower tonight, okay?
Bandit: Oh! Again!
Bluey: Will I already be asleep when you get back?
Chilli: Yes, but I'll still come in and give you a kiss good night.
Bluey: But I won't feel it!
Chilli: Yes, you will.
Bingo: Who'll put us to bed?
Chilli: Your dad! It's a Daddy putdown.
Bingo: Hooray!
Bandit: Don't worry, Bluey. I'm all over it.
He lets go of Bingo and grabs her fast yet again, this time Bingo almost hitting the ground.
Bandit: Whoa! That was a close one. No more of that game.
Bluey (voiceover): This episode of Bluey is called Daddy Putdown.
Bandit & Bingo: Bye!
Bandit: Okay, kids, what should we do?
Bluey: Ring Mum and ask her to come back.
Bandit: We're not doing that.
Bluey: But I miss her!
Bandit: Well, let's take your mind off it. How about we play a game?
Bingo: Let's play Follow the Leader!
Bluey & Bandit: Yeah!
Bandit: Right! I'm your Magnificent Leader, and you have to follow me. You kids got that?!
