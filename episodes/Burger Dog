Script
The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler house at night.
Cut to the living room. Bandit lies on the couch, reading a newspaper with a tennis player on the front page.
Bandit: ♫ "Layin' on the couch, readin' 'bout the Prime Minister"♫
Bandit: ♫ "Oh, what's he done now?"♫
Bluey and Bingo run in with a bluetooth speaker.
Bluey: "Dad, can you play a song on your phone for us?"
Bandit: "Uh, yeah, okay. As long as it's not too annoying."
Bingo: "No, it's not annoying."
Bandit puts his newspaper aside and rummages under his bum for the phone.
Bandit: "What's it called?"
Bluey, Bingo: "Burger Dog!"
Bandit pulls out his phone and begins typing.
Bandit: "Burger... Dog."
He hits play, and sets the phone down on the floor.
Bandit: "Okay, there you go!"
He opens his paper and resumes reading. As the song begins to play, Bingo and Bluey onto the rug in the centre of the room and start to dance. The song is repetitive, sung with a high-pitched filtered voice.
Singer: ♫ "Burger Dog, B-Burger Dog" ♫
Singer: ♫ "He has pickles and he has cheese" ♫
Bluey giggles.
Singer: ♫ "Burger Dog, B-Burger Dog" ♫
Singer: ♫ "Fluffy bun with some ses'me seeds" ♫
Cut to a close-up of Bluey dancing.
Singer: ♫ "Burger Dog, B-Burger Dog" ♫
Cut to a close-up of Bingo dancing.
Singer: ♫ "Yap yap yap yap yap yap yap!" ♫
Cut to a close-up of Bandit, reading on the couch. His left eye twitches, then he stares at the ceiling.
Singer: ♫ "Burger Dog, B-Burger Dog" ♫
Cut back to the shot of the room. Bluey and Bingo continue dancing.
Singer: ♫ "He was once a wiener dog, now he is a burger dog" ♫
Chorus: ♫ "Burger Dog!" ♫
Bandit reaches down and picks up his phone.
Singer: ♫ "Burger Dog—" ♫
He pauses the song.
Bluey, Bingo: "Hey!"
Bandit: "Ugh. Sorry kids. My phone's run out of battery."
Bingo grabs for his phone. He pulls it away.
Bingo: "No it hasn't!"
Bluey grabs for his phone. He pulls it away from her too.
Bandit: "Whoop!"
Bluey: "Show us!"
He holds his phone up in the air, out of both of their reach.
Bandit: "Hey!"
Bluey and Bingo jump, trying to get at the phone. Bandit holds them off with his free hand.
Bluey: "You're tricking us! Just 'cause the screen is black, doesn't mean it's out of battery!"
Bandit: "Bluey!"
Bingo: "I know!"
Bingo runs off. Bluey climbs onto the couch.
Bandit: "Look, I really want to listen to Hamburger Dog too..."
Bluey tries to climb over Bandit, he pushes her back again. Bluey growls.
Bandit: "...It's a hauntingly beautiful song."
Bandit pushes Bluey back by her nose.
Bandit: "But you know these new phones, when you update the software, it stuffs your battery."
Bluey climbs onto Bandit's chest.
Bandit: "They're trying to make you get the flash new one. But I'm not havin' it!"
He continues holding his phone out of reach, as Bluey grunts and struggles. Bandit pushes harder, and she falls on her bum.
Bandit: "It's out of battery, kid. Trust me, I would never lie to you."
The phone rings. The caller ID screen shows Chilli. Bluey looks at Bandit, nonplussed. Bandit meets her gaze, embarassed. Then he looks past her.
Chilli and Bingo stand at the end of the couch. Chilli has her phone to her ear, and Bingo has her arms folded smugly. The phone continues to ring.
Bandit answers the phone.
Bandit: "Hello?"
Chilli: "Are you lying to your children again?"
Bingo and Bluey both nod.
Bluey, Bingo: "Yes."
Bandit smiles sheepishly.
