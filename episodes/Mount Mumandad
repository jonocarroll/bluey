Script
It begins from a distant view of the Heeler home at night, with the Heeler family entering their home.
Bluey: "HOOOME!"
Bingo: "Home!"
Bandit: "Ugh.."
Chilli: "What a day!"
Chilli yawning, on her way to the couch.
Chilli: "Cut us down kids."
Bluey and Bingo: "Yeah! Chop! Chop! Chop!"
Bandit: "Timber!"
Both Chilli and Bandit lie on the couch, Chilli is laying on the floor with her feet on the couch, adjacent to her is Bandit, who is on the couch with his head most likely not even touching the couch. The kids giggle.
Chilli, exhausted: "5 minutes until bed kids."
Bandit, also exhausted: "And, 5 years until the next trip to CrazyWorld."
Bluey: "Can we play a game?"
Bandit: "As long as it's 1 that you don't have to move any part of my body or say anything with my mouth.
Bluey: "Ok!" She runs up to Bingo
