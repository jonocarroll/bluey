The episode opens with an establishing shot of a hotel. The Heelers drive up in their car. The kids are singing.
Bluey, Bingo: ♫ Two little men in a flying saucer ♫
The scene changes to the entrance of the parking garage. The barrier is down. Bandit leans out the driver's side with a key-fob, straining to get it in range of a scanner.
Bluey, Bingo: ♫ Flew down to Earth one day ♫
Bandit: (grunting) Ergh! Aargh!
The scene changes to the interior of the parking garage. The Heelers pull into a space and exit the car.

TITLE CARD - Relax
Bluey : This episode of Bluey is called Relax.
The scene changes to the parking lot lift. Chilli is repeatedly pressing the call button.
Chilli: C'mon, lift, we haven't got all day.
Bingo: Yes, we do.
The lift dings and the doors open. The scene changes to the interior of the lift. Bingo, Chilli, and Bluey enter. Chilli's arms are full of luggage, an umbrella, and a book.
Bingo: Ooh, swingy bar!
Bingo jumps up and hangs from the hand rail.
Bluey: Buttons!
Chilli: Careful, Bingo.
Bluey: Which button do I press?
Chilli: Five.
Bluey presses four.
Chilli: No, that's four.

Chilli: Yep, that's it.
Bluey: Whoo!
Bandit enters the lift with a trolley full of luggage.
Chilli: Oh, duck cake. I didn't bring the aftersun.
Bandit: Hey, relax. We can buy some here. Come on, we're on holiday.
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah, holiday!
Chilli: I'll relax when I'm on the beach, reading my book.
Bingo climbs up and puts her arms over the railing, so she can look in the mirror at the back of the elevator.
Bluey: What's your book about?
Chilli: It's about how to be happy.
Bingo: That's easy, you just do this.
Bingo smiles hugely into the mirror.
Bingo: Geeee!
Chilli, Bluey, and Bandit laugh.
The scene changes to the entrance of the hotel suite. The door handle jiggles.
Chilli: (grunting offscreen) Grrr. Unh! Ooh!
The door bursts open, and Bluey and Bingo run in past Chilli. Bingo pauses in the entrance, Bluey runs past the camera and off screen.
Bluey: Which one's our room?!
Bingo: Ooh, tiles!
Bingo runs further into the suite, off screen. Chilli sets her luggage down just inside the entrance.
Chilli: Dump your stuff, sunscreen up, and let's hit the beach.
The scene changes to the girls' bedroom. Bluey runs in, panting.
Bluey: Ah! Bingo!
Bingo enters.
Bingo: What is it? (gasps)
The camera moves, showing what they're looking at: bunk beds.
Bluey: Bunk beds!
Bingo falls to her knees.
Bingo: BUNK BEDS!
Bluey and Bingo talk over each other.
Bingo: Can I have the top?!
Bluey: You can have the top, if you like.
Bingo: Thanks!
Bingo climbs the ladder, and Bluey climbs onto the lower bunk. The camera changes to show just the lower bunk.
Bluey: Ooh, look, a present!
Bluey picks up something round from her pillow. Bingo climbs back down a few rungs to see.
Bingo: What?
Bluey: I think it's soap. Have you got one?
Bingo: I'll see.
Bingo climbs up. The camera moves to the top bunk. Bingo does find a bar of soap on her pillow.
Bingo: Yes! (gasp)
Bingo points offscreen.
Bingo: Bluey, we've got cupboards!
Bluey squeals and drops her soap. They both run into the closet, giggling.
Bluey: Coat hangers!
Bingo: Are they all ours?
Bluey: Yeah!
Bingo: Wooow!
They both start jumping, trying to reach the coat hangers.
Bluey: Here, wait, I'll stand on this.
Bluey climbs up on the safe and grabs a hanger.
Bingo: What is that?
Bluey: I dunno. 
Bingo: Let's pretend it's an oven.
Bluey: Okay, and we can be mermaids.
The scene changes to the lower bunk. Bluey has wrapped a towel around her waist in imitation of a mermaid tail. She hums as she adjusts some coat hangers, which she has hung from the slats of the upper bunk.
Bluey: (hums) Mermaid water, may I have a pie, please?
The scene changes to show the rest of the room. Bingo is standing by the safe, also wearing a towel as a tail.
Bingo: Oh, yes. I'll just cook it.
Bingo slides one of the bars of soap into the safe, using a hanger as a peel. She closes the safe and presses a button.
Bingo: (imitating oven) Boop-boop. It will be ready soon, Mermaid.
Bluey: (singing) ♫ Thank you! ♫ 
Chilli enters, carrying a bag and sun hat.
Chilli: Ready, girls?
Bingo opens the oven, and uses her hanger-peel to remove the soap.
Bingo: (imitating oven) Ding! Ready!
Chilli: No, I mean, are you ready to go down to the beach? Have you sunscreened?
Bingo: Oh. No.
Chilli: Uggh. Come on, the sunscreen's in the bathroom. Let's go.
Bluey and Bingo: Okay, mum.
Chilli: I want to start relaxing.
The scene changes to a bathroom. Bluey and Bingo run in.
Bingo: Bathtub!
Bluey: Whoa, Bingo, what's this?
Bluey and Bingo approach the toilet. It has a paper band on it from housekeeping.
Bingo: I don't know.
Bluey: The toilet's got a ribbon?
Bingo: Maybe it won a prize.
Bluey: Yeah, the best toilet in the world!
Bingo pats the toilet seat.
Bingo: I congratulations your ribbon.
Bluey and Bingo clap. Bluey raises the toilet seat, snapping the paper band. They both giggle.
Bingo: Ooh! I want to rip one.
Bluey: Hm, can't see another one. Let's see if there's another toilet!
Chilli: Alright, how are we—
Bingo: YAAAAH!
Bluey and Bingo run out of the bathroom.
Chilli: Whoop! Hey!
The scene changes to the master bedroom. The hallway is visible from one door, and another bathroom through the other. Bluey runs past in the hallway.
Bluey: Ooh, hang on!
Bluey runs back, crashing into Bingo. They both squeal and laugh.
Bluey: In here.
Bingo: (giggles)
The scene changes to the master bathroom. It has another toilet with a paper band on it.
Bingo It's got one.
Bingo lifts the toilet lid, breaking the band. They both giggle.
Bingo: Congratulations, toilet.
Bluey: Bingo, look!
The camera pulls back to show a large corner tub with a spray wand and water jets.
Bingo: Whoa! BATHTUB!
They both clamber into the tub.
Bluey: It's a triangle!
Bingo slips off the side of the tub and slides across the bottom.
Bingo: And it's got a microphone!
Bingo grabs the spray wand and sings into it.
Bingo: ♫ La-la-la-la! ♫ 
Bluey leans down to look into a water jet.
Bluey: What are these things?
Bingo puts down the spray wand and picks up a plastic container.
Bingo: (gasps) Bluey.
Bluey: Is that bubble bath?!
Bluey and Bingo squeal in joy.
The scene changes to the kitchen. Bandit is transferring food from their cooler to the fridge. Chilli is looking in cabinets.
Chilli: Oh, they don't even give you dishwashing detergent.
Bluey and Bingo run in with the container of bubble soap.
Bluey and Bingo: Mum, can we have a bubble bath?
Chilli: What?! No. We're going to the beach.
Bluey and Bingo: Please!
Chilli: You can have a bath after you've been for a swim.
Bluey and Bingo: (moaning) Awww.
Bandit: Oh, go on, let them have a bath. They're on holiday.
Bluey and Bingo: (gasp)
Chilli: Okay. Fine.
Bluey and Bingo: YES!
Bluey and Bingo run off.
Chilli: I just thought it would be good to get down to the beach.
Bandit: Well, why don't you head down and we'll meet you there?
Chilli: Oh. Are you sure?
Bandit: Yeah, I got it covered up here. Go, relax.
Chilli: Well... Okay.
The scene changes to the entryway. Chilli enters wearing her sunhat, carrying a bag and beach chair.
Chilli: Bye, kids. I'll see you soon.
Bluey and Bingo: (offscreen) Bye, Mum!
Chilli exits through the door. The scene changes to the lift.
Chilli looks at herself in the mirror. After a moment, she smiles widely.
Chilli: Geeee!
The scene changes to outside the hotel; there is a patio with a glass fence, with the beach outside. Chilli opens the gate and walks through.
The scene changes to the beach. Chilli sets up her chair and sits down.
Chilli: Okay, time to relax.
Chilli stares into space for a moment. A fly buzzes around her face. She waves it away
Chilli: Ooh! Off.
The scene changes to the master bathroom. Bluey and Bingo are having a bubble bath, and Bandit is relaxing on the bed in the background. Bluey has sculpted the bubbles into a poodle cut, and Bingo has given herself a beard and moustache. Bluey is singing into the spray wand.
Bluey: ♫ Ooh, I love bubbles, I love you, bubbles... ♫
Bingo: (deeply) Oh, you sing so well, babe.
Bandit: Hey, you want me to turn the spa on?
Bluey: ♫ What is a spa? ♫
Bandit: I'll show you. 
Bandit gets up and walks into the bathroom.
Bandit: See those little holes?
Bluey: ♫ Yeeees. ♫
Bandit: Ready?
Bandit presses a button, and the water in the tub starts to churn. Bluey and Bingo are jostled around and quickly lose their bubble hair. They squeal and giggle.
The scene changes back to Chilli on the beach. She is now holding her book. She opens it.
Chilli: Okay, chapter one. (reading) "Wherever you go, there you are. You need to—"
Chilli slams the book shut.
Chilli: Actually, I should just enjoy the beach a bit before I start reading.
Chilli stares into space for less than a second. She opens the book again.
Chilli: No, I should read my book.
The scene changes back to the master bedroom. Bluey and Bingo walk in with towel turbans, holding their hands in a "fancy" way.
Bluey: (snootily) Did you enjoy that spa bath, Olympia?
Bingo: (snootily) Oh, yes, Melinda, I certainly did.
They exit into the hallway, humming. The scene changes to the living room, where Bluey and Bingo enter. They stop in front of a recliner.
Bluey: (snootily) We are fancy ladies.
Bingo: (snootily) Indeed.
Bluey: (normally) Ooh, this chair has a handle. That's fancy.
Bingo: (normally) What happens when you pull it?
Bluey shrugs.
Bluey: (in the cadence of "I dunno") mm-mm-mm.
Bluey pulls the lever. The foot rest extends, knocking Bingo over. Bluey and Bingo both squeal and laugh.
Bingo: Again!
The scene changes to the entryway. The door opens, and Chilli enters with her beach stuff. As she sets her stuff down by the door, Bandit walks in, with the now empty trolley.
Bandit: What are you doing here?
Chilli: I don't know how to relax.
Bandit: Aww, come here.
Bandit hugs her. Chilli looks over his shoulder, sadly.
Chilli It's harder than it looks.
The recliner thumps, and Bluey and Bingo squeal and laugh from offscreen. Bandit lets go of the hug, and puts his hand on Chilli's shoulder.
Bandit: I'll tell you what, you want to learn to relax, go and get some tips from the masters.
The scene changes to the living room. Bingo has both hands on the recliner lever, and Bluey is crouching in front of it.
Bingo: Yeah, a little bit this way.
Bluey sidles two steps to camera left.
'Bingo: Wait, no, back that way.
Bluey sidles one step to camera right.
Bluey: Mum, watch this.
Chilli: Watch what?
Bingo pulls the lever, launching Bluey forward to land on her bum. Bluey and Bingo both squeal and laugh.
Chilli: Hah! You guys are crazy!
Bingo: My turn!
The camera focuses on Chilli, as the kids squeal offscreen.
Chilli: You kids just go about it, don't you?
The camera pulls back. Bluey launches Bingo. The kids giggle. Bandit enters with a mug of tea, which he hands to Chilli.
Bandit: Here, babe. Go on, go hit the deck.
Chilli exits, as Bingo launches Bluey again.
The camera changes to the balcony. Chilli closes the sliding door behind her as the kids continue to squeal and laugh. The background noise fades as she walks to the railing and leans on it.
Chilli: Just go about it.
Chilli inhales deeply, then exhales with a sigh. The background music, which has been riffing on the Shaker hymn "Simple Gifts", swells into a complete verse of the song.
The scene changes to show the tops of pine trees blowing in the breeze. Then, we see the sky, with the distance silhouettes of seagulls. Then, we see the calm ocean, with a distant container ship. The scene comes back to Chilli. She blinks slowly and smiles. She sets her tea down and lays back on a deck chair. She closes her eyes
Bluey and Bingo run in, both holding a pair of remote controls.
Bluey and Bingo: Mum, there's four remote controls!
Chilli doesn't open her eyes as she responds.
Chilli: (cheerfully) Oh, great!
Bingo: (gasps) Bluey, look!
The camera moves to show the view from the balcony, as Bluey and Bingo press their faces to the glass balcony railing. We see all the elements from the earlier montage together in one shot.
Bluey and Bingo: Woooooow! Can we go to the beach?!
Chilli laughs and opens her eyes.
The credits music is another verse of "Simple Gifts". Bluey and Bingo in towel turbans walk daintily across the screen, in front of the credits.
