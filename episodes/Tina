(This episode starts with a distant shot of the house, then cuts to the kitchen counter; Bluey and Bingo has just finished eating and Bandit is wiping the counter.)
Bluey: (sing-song) Thanks for breakfaaast! (proceeds to leave with Bingo, forgetting the plates).
Bandit: Hey-hey! Plates in the dishwasher! You gotta tidy up after yourself.
Bluey: Aww, why?
Bandit: Cause' I said so.
Bingo: Why do we always have to do what you say?
Bandit: Cause' I'm bigger than you.
Bluey and Bingo: Hey!
Bingo: That's not nice!
Bluey nods in agreement.
Bandit: Well, there's not much you can do about it. (picks up cutting board and heads to the sink)
Bluey: Ooh, Bingo! I've got an idea. (whispers to Bingo)
Bingo: Yeah!
Both Bluey and Bingo start giggling with Bingo squee-giggling.
Bandit: This idea better involve plates and a dishwasher.
Meanwhile Bingo gets up and runs behind her dad.
Bluey: Oh, it does!
Bingo: Hello, Dad. I'd like you to meet Tina (pulls her dad to look around).
Bandit: (to Bingo) Who?
Bluey: Tina. She's our friend. She's invisible.
Bandit: Okay. (bows down to shake what he thinks is her hand) Nice to meet you, Tina.
Bingo: That's her knees.
Bandit: Oh.
Bluey: Tina's big.
Bandit: Uh... (looks up, with the camera gradually rising to give an impression of Tina's size) How big?
Bluey: Sit on him, Tina! (points at her dad)
Bandit: What? (falls to the ground, as if Tina sits on him) Oof! Hey!
Bluey and Bingo giggle
Bluey: (to her dad) Bigger than you!
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called "Tina".
The scene cuts back to the kitchen with Bandit, still being squashed by Tina. With Bluey and Bingo standing next to Bandit both with sly looks on their faces.
Bandit: *Grunts* Get off me Tina!
Bingo: Tina only does what we tell her to.
Bandit: Well, tell her to get off!
Bluey: Yeah, WE could...if, you tidy up our plates for us!
Bandit: What?! No way!
Bluey: Okay, fine, stay where you are Tina.
Both Bluey and Bingo start giggling again as Bandit tries to lift himself off of Tina.
Bandit: Oh! Tina, get off! *Grunts* (collapses in defeat) Fine, I'll do it...
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Bluey: You can get off of him now, Tina.
Bandit finally "feels" the pressure of Tina lifting up from him. Bandit grunts, gets up and brushes his knees. Then he slowly walks toward the kitchen while keeping his gaze towards Tina. When he reaches the kitchen sink, he quickly grabs a frying pan and swings at it towards Tina.
Bandit: AHA! (Bluey and Bingo both flinch in shock) Bring it on Tina!
Bluey: What?!
Bingo: The cheek!
Bluey: Step on his foot Tina!
Tina "stomps" on Bandit's foot, causing Bandit to shout in pain as he jumps around on one foot.
Bandit: Ow!
Bingo: Now, kick him in the bum!
Bandit: Whoa, what?! (Tina "kicks" Bandit's bum causing him to jump forward) Ow! Tina!
Bluey and Bingo giggle at this.
Bluey: Now, would you like to try that again?
Bandit: Yes...
The scene transitions to Bandit putting away the dishes in the dishwasher while Bluey and Bingo stand next to him giggling. Just then, Chilli walks into the kitchen, phone in her hand with her asking Bluey and Bingo to do something.
Chilli: Okay, kids, upstairs for a bath.
Bluey: (Not looking at her mum) No, we're not really into that, thanks.
Chilli: (Sternly) Oh, really?
Bluey: Yeah!
Bingo: Run along now.
Chilli: You've got three seconds. (Holds up her hand and lifts up her fingers for every second that passes) One...
Bluey claps her hands, then Bluey and Bingo move back a bit.
Bluey: Tina?
Chilli: Two...Who's Tina?
Bandit: She's the kids' very lovely invisible friend.
Bluey: Get her out of here!
Chilli: Three...-(Tina pushes her and tries to stuff her in the closet)-WHA--OI! AH! Ugh!
Tina slams Chilli to the closet.
Chilli: What? (The closet door opens, and Chilli starts being stuffed into the closet. She reaches one arm out to stop Tina but its no use) Hey! Ohh!
Chilli bangs on the closet door. Bluey and Bingo run up to the closet squee-giggling.
Chilli: Let me out!
Bingo: Bluey, we'll never have to do what Mum and Dad tell us too ever again!
Bluey: Yeah, and not only that, watch! Daaaad!
Bandit: (deadpan) What do you want?
Bluey: Put on this tutu and do a little dance for us, please?
Bandit: What?! No way!
Bluey: Oh, Tina?
Bandit: (Looks up at Tina for a second with a nervous look) *Sighs* Okay...
Bluey: They have to do whatever we say now!
Bingo: Oh, yeah!
Bandit starts to sheepishly dance while singing softly causing the girls to laugh at this. The scene slightly expands to show Chilli continuing to bang on the closet door.
Chilli: Let me out!
The scene transitions to the living room where the girls are watching Chunky Chimp.
Chunky Chimp: Oh no, it's a thunderstorm!
Then the view is expanded to show Bluey and Bingo sitting on a makeshift chair and a beanbag along with an umbrella respectively. Both girls are wearing sunglasses happily enjoying the movie with Bandit and Chilli standing in the background nervously. Bluey has a drink, some popcorn and a big of chips while Bingo has a juice box. Bluey grabs a popcorn and tries to pop it into her mouth, but she misses, and it lands on the floor.
Bluey: Ugh, servant!
Bandit rushes up to her.
Bandit: Yes Bluey?
Bluey: *Clears her throat* Ahem!
Bandit: I mean, "Yes, Bluey the Awesome"?
Bluey: Would you be so kind as to get that popcorn for me, please?
Bandit: Right away...(Grabs it and motions Bluey to take it).
Bluey: Be a dear and pop it in my mouth for me.
Bandit: (Rolls his eyes) Yes, "Bluey the Awesome"...(puts the popcorn in Bluey's mouth).
Bluey: Help me chew.
Bandit groans as he lifts Bluey's mouth up and down. The view then pans to Bingo sipping her juicebox before placing it down on the floor. Then she requests something to Chilli.
Bingo: Toilet!
Chilli: (Rushes to grab Bingo) Yes, your ladyship!
Chilli lifts Bingo as Bingo giggles at this.
Bluey: (Motions her dad) Away with you now.
Bandit: Permission to speak?
A fly appears buzzing around Bluey, but she doesn't notice it yet. She pulls down her sunglasses.
Bluey: Make it quick.
Bandit: Look, "Bluey the Awesome". We don't tell you to do things just to be mean. It's for your own good, you don't want to live like an animal.
Bluey: We can live however we want! We've got Tina. 
The fly buzzes closer to her causing Bluey to swat it.
Bluey: Hey, shoo fly! Get away! (Takes off her sunglasses) Why are there so many flies around?
Bandit: Cause' you rolled onto a jam sandwich half an hour ago.
Bluey turns her head around and notices half of the sandwich on her back.
Bluey: Oh, where's the other half?
Bandit: You need a bath.
Bluey: Never! (More flies appear around her) Oh, flies!
Bingo is then seen running into the living room screaming, trying to run away from Chilli who is chasing after her.
Bingo: AAAAAAHH!!!
Chilli: Bingo, get back here!
Bingo: Tina, help!
Chilli is pushed onto the couch by Tina and tries to crush her. Bingo giggles at this.
Chilli: Wha--ooh! *Grunts* Tina! Get off!
Bluey: (Still trying to shoo away the flies) What happened?
Bingo: I went to the toilet, and mom tried to make me wash my hands. (Raises her hands)
Bluey: (Slightly backs off) Ew! Bingo, you didn't wash your hands?!
Bingo: Nope! (Notices the flies) Hey, what? Get away!
As Bingo's back is turned, Bluey notices the other half of the sandwich on Bingo's back.
Bluey: Oh, there's the other half.
Bingo: (Turns around and notices it too) Ew!
Bingo peels it off and tries to give it to Bluey.
Bluey: Don't touch me! You've got toilet hands!
The flies start to buzz around both of them.
Bluey and Bingo: Ah! Get away, flies!
The view pans out to the kids swatting the flies, and Chilli still fighting against Tina on the couch with Bandit watching. He comes up with a plan.
Chilli: *Grunting* Get-Off-Me-Tina!
Bandit: (Grabs a nearby cushion) It's now or never, Bandit...
Chilli: Get off!
Bandit appears behind the couch for a surprise attack!
Bandit: Hey, Tina!
Bandit whacks the cushion on Tina and successfully knocks her off. Both Chilli and Bandit quickly grab her and hold her down.
Chilli: I've got her! I've got her!
Bandit: Hold her down!
Bluey: Hey, let go of Tina!
Chilli: Get her legs! (Whacks Tina with a pillow).
Bandit: *Gets kicked by Tina* She kicks like a mule!
Bluey: (Swats the flies again) Shoo! Oh, Bingo! Use your toilet hands!
As Bluey continues swatting the flies, Bingo starts walking towards her parents with her hands outstretched to get them off Tina.
Bingo: Toilet hands!
Bandit notices Bingo and stops her with his foot.
Bandit: Ah! Get out of here, you little grub!
Chilli: Oh! Why does Tina stink so bad?
Bandit: Quick, *grunting* let's-get-her-outside!
The scene transitions to the front door with Chilli kicking the front door open. Then Chilli and Bandit are seen carrying Tina outside to the car.
Chilli: Hyah! *Grunts* She weighs a ton!
Bandit: She's a lot of woman!
Chilli: Get her in the car!
The two grunt as Bandit proceeds to open the back car door where the two adults quickly lift Tina up and toss her into the trunk. As Bandit slams the door shut, Wendy is seen on the other side of the fence staring at them dumbfounded. Bandit and Chilli notices her, to which Bandit says:
Bandit: You didn't see anything!
Wendy: Ooh!!! *Runs away*
Bluey and Bingo appear outside. Bluey quickly opens the car door to let Tina out.
Bluey: Tina, use your karate!
Chilli backs off nervously, but then gets kicked down by Tina.
Bandit: Aah! You're on your own!
Bandit quickly runs to the front of the car but gets confronted by Tina.
Bandit: Aah! (Nervously) Uh, Tina. Come on. Let's just talk about this.
Bingo: Get him, Tina!
Tina starts chasing after Bandit. She eventually grabs him and "handcuffs" him next to the car.
Bandit: Aah! Ah! Hey, easy, easy!
Bluey and Bingo giggle at this.
Bandit: Ugh! Tapping out, tapping out!
Chilli: Okay, Okay. We give up. You win.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Bluey: High five!
The sisters high-five, but that's when Bluey remembers about Bingo's hands.
Bluey: Ew! Bingo!
Bandit: Ah, Tina, I'm sorry, but you stink!
Chilli: Yeah. (Plugging her nose) When was the last time she had a bath?
Bluey: Tina's never had a bath. And we're not having a bath either. 
A fly appears causing Bluey to swat it away.
Bluey: Ah! Shoo!
Chilli: Hey, w-wait, whose tooth is this? (Picks up an imaginary tooth)
Bandit: It's huge.
Chilli: Is this Tina's?
Bluey: Yeah, it is.
Chilli: And look, (picks up another tooth) here's another one.
Bluey: Why did her teeth fall out?
Chilli: Well, when was the last time she brushed them?
Bluey: Tina doesn't brush her teeth!
Both Chilli and Bandit simultaneously say their sentences:
Chilli: Ugh! 
Bandit: Ew!
Chilli: Well, that's why her teeth are falling out.
Bluey: Oh!
Chilli kneels down to the kids' level.
Chilli: Kids, when we tell you, you have to have a bath or brush your teeth or wash your hands. It's because there's a good reason to do all those things.
Bluey: But when we ask dad why, he just says. *Mimicking Bandit* "Because I said so."
Bingo: Yeah, he says we have to because he's bigger than us.
Chilli: (Eyes at Bandit) Oh really?
Bandit: Maybe I should just give them three seconds?
Chilli: Oh, yeah...Look, we'll probably still say those things cause' we're busy. But now you know what we really mean.
Bluey: Okay, mum.
Chilli: Bring it in.
Chilli gestures the girls for a hug and they do so...But Bingo reminds them of something they forgot about!
Bingo: Toilet hands!
Both Chilli and Bluey jump back and scream in shock. Leading Bingo to giggle at this.
Bandit: Tina, I think you can let go of me now.
Bluey: Oh yeah, it's all good now, Tina.
Tina let's go of Bandit.
Bandit: *Grunts* Oh! (Turns around to face Tina) No hard feelings love.
Tina handshakes Bandit, but her grip to too strong for Bandit to handle.
Bandit: Ow! Jeez! She's got a handshake on her!
Both Bluey and Bingo squee-giggle at this while Chilli silently laughs.
The scene then transitions to nighttime. With the view of the neighborhood being shown. Then the scene transitions to inside the bathroom where Bluey, Bingo, and Tina are having a bath. Bluey is seen scrubbing Tina while teaching her how to bathe while Bingo is brushing and teaching her how to brush her teeth.
Bluey: This is called shampoo, Tina. It makes your hair smell like coconuts.
Bingo: So, then you go round and round and up and down. And don't forget the back ones!
The view expands to show Bandit and Chilli watches the three of them bathe.
Bandit: And make sure you clean your teeth, Bluey.
Both Bingo and Bluey glare at their parents.
Bluey: *Ahem*!
Bandit: Ah, I mean, "Bluey the Awesome".
Bluey: Right away!
The final view is shown of the neighborhood at night before the end credits are shown.
The episode music continues through the credits. Instead of Bluey dancing, the screen is blank for a few seconds, then one of the halves of the jelly sandwich is shown before a fly is shown landing on it.
