(This episode starts with a distant shot of the house, then cuts to the kitchen counter; Bluey and Bingo has just finished eating and Bandit is wiping the counter.)
Bluey	: (sing-song) Thanks for breakfaaast! (proceeds to leave with Bingo, forgetting the plates).
Bandit : Hey-hey! Plates in the dishwasher! You gotta tidy up after yourself.
Bluey	: Aww, why?
Bandit : 'Cause I said so.
Bingo	: Why do we always have to do what you say?
Bandit : 'Cause I'm bigger than you.
Both girls : Hey!
Bingo : That's not nice.
Bandit : Well, there's not much you can do about it. (picks up cutting board and heads to the sink)
Bluey : Ooh, Bingo! I've got an idea. (whispers to Bingo)
Bingo : Yeah!
(Bluey giggles)
Bandit : This idea better involve plates and a dishwasher.
(Meanwhile Bingo gets up and runs behind her dad)
Bluey : Oh, it does!
Bingo : Hello, Dad. I'd like you to meet Tina (pulls her dad to look around).
Bandit : (to Bingo) Who?
Bluey : Tina. She's our friend. She's invisible.
Bandit : Okay. (bows down to shake what he thinks is her hand) Nice to meet you, Tina.
Bingo : That's her knees.
Bandit : Oh.
Bluey : Tina's big.
Bandit : Uh... (looks up, with the camera gradually rising to give an impression of Tina's size) How big?
Bluey : Sit on him, Tina! (points at her dad)
Bandit : What? (falls to the ground, as if Tina sits on him) Hey!
Bluey and Bingo giggle
Bluey : (to her dad) Bigger than you!
