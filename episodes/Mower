TITLE CARD: MOWER
An establishing shot shows the Heeler house. A trio of sparrows fly by.
Cut to the backyard where Bandit is standing behind his lawn mower and is wearing a straw hat and gaiters.
Bandit kneels down and pulls the starter rope twice.
Bandit: (gruntily) C'mon.
The mower only sputters a little bit after each pull of the rope.
Bandit lets off the rope and slightly punts the insubordinate mower.
Bandit: (teeth gritting) C'mon!
He proceeds to pull the rope several more times-
Bandit: (still biting teeth) C'mon, urgh!
-before letting go and falling few steps backwards.
Bandit: (slightly out of breath) Look, I don't ask for much: Just once a week; you just got to start once a week, so I can mow that lawn, okay? I need you to start, so let's work together, c'mon; every week you do this, but this week we're going to start it, okay let's go,-
Bandit kneels down- 
Bandit: (shrieks) -START !!!
-and pulls the starter rope the whole length; the mower still refuses to start.
Still holding on the rope, Bandit repeatedly tugs the rope while giving few cries of frustration before again letting off the rope and proceeding to shake the handlebar.
Bandit: (shrieks) START !!!
The mower soon once again falls completely silent causing Bandit to fall down on his knee leaning on the handlebar.
Bandit: (defeated) No-ho-o!
Bandit squints at the mower and soon stands up visibly infuriated.
He winds up a kick, grunting-
Bandit: (biting teeth) C'MON!!!
- while landing the into the mower which moves forward a little.
Bandit is now holding his hurt foot while blurting out some sounds of visible agony before standing up normally and taking deeper breathers.
Bandit: Okay....here we go...friendly. You only have to do one thing: All you got to do, is start, so we can mow the lawn. You don't have to pick up kids; you don't have to make lunches; you don't have to make the beds; so work with me here; here we-
Bandit once again kneels down and pulls the start rope.
Bandit: (loudly) GO ! COME ON !!!
Bandit kneels and makes one more full pull and the engine finally whirrs to running rather than sputtering to halt.
Bandit let's off the rope and gives a fist pump, 
Bandit: YES !
He kneels down, hugging the handlebar.
Bandit: I love you mower; I knew you'd start!
Bandit gives a smacking loud "MmmWah"-kiss to handlebar and stands up.
Bandit: LET'S MOW THIS LAWN !!!
 Bandit pushes the mower off the scene in a running speed while frantically laughing.
