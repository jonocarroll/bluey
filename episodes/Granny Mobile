Script
Bandit is seen driving the car, with Bluey, Bingo, and Muffin sitting in the backseats.
Muffin Heeler: What can we play at your house, Bluey? 
Bluey Heeler: I'm not sure. 
The car drives up and past Doreen's house, Bandit looks out the window.
Bandit Heeler: Oh, look. Doreen's having a garage sale. 
Doreen waves at the Heelers. Bluey, Bingo, and Muffin are looking back at her.
ALL: Oooh! Ah! 
Bluey, Bingo, and Muffin spot a scooter with a sign for $300; excited, they shout...
ALL: GRANNY MOBILE!
TITILE CARD - GRANNY MOBILE. A plate being held up is shown.
Muffin: (reading) This episode of Bluey is called 'Granny Mobile'. 
The Heelers are now at Doreen's garage sale.
Chilli Heeler: Having a bit of a garage sale, Doreen?
Doreen: Yes, love. I'm trying to get a bit of cash to go on holiday to the reef! 
Bandit: Well, if someone buys Len's old scooter, that'll help.
Doreen: Oh, yeah. 
A shopper walks over, holding a painting.
Shopper: How much is this?
Doreen: Oh, whatever you think, love. 
It cuts to show Bluey, Bingo, and Muffin starting their game of Grannies.
Bluey: Okay. Let's decide what sort of grannies we'll be. 
Bingo Heeler: I'm going to be a can't hear anything granny. 
Bluey: I'm gonna be a kind granny. 
Muffin: What sort of granny can I be?
Bluey: Oh. Um. I'm not sure there are any other types of grannies. 
Muffin: Ugh, it's not FAIR! I KNEW I wouldn't get to be a granny! 
Bluey: Ah, that's it! You can be a grouchy granny! 
Muffin: Oh yeah. 
Muffin grumbles and makes an angry face.
Bluey: And make it that you want to sell us your granny mobile. 
Muffin: Okay. 
Bluey: Let's go, Bingo. 
Bingo: Pardon? 
Shopper: How much do you want for this? 
Doreen: Oh, well, what do you think? 
Shopper: Two dollars? 
Doreen: Okay. That's fine. 
The shopper hands her $2 and walks off.
Doreen: Thanks.
Chilli: Doreen! That vase is worth way more than that. 
Doreen: Oh, I don't want to make a fuss. 
Bluey and Bingo walk up to Doreen.
Bluey: Doreen, can we play with your granny mobile please? 
Doreen: Go for it. I'm taking the battery out so it won't move. 
Muffin: Oh yes it will! 'Bugalugs' is going to push it. 
BOTH: Yeah! 
Bandit: Am I 'Bugalugs'? 
Soon, Muffin, now the grouchy granny, is being pushed along the scooter by Bandit Bugalugs.
Muffin: Faster! 
Bandit: Yes, nana. 
Muffin: And you're going over too many cracks. 
Bandit: It's a footpath! 
Muffin: (poking him with her bag) Don't talk that to me, sonny. 
Bandit: Gee, you are one grouchy granny. 
Bluey and Bingo are standing in front of the house. Muffin gets pushed over.
Muffin: Stop. I said stop!
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: Okay, nana. 
Bluey: Hello, Gladys. 
Muffin: Ugh. I'm selling the granny mobile. Are you gonna buy it?! 
Bluey: Oh. Well... 
Muffin: Make up your mind!
The duo laugh again.
Bandit: Nana!
Bluey: How much is it, love? 
Muffin: Bugalugs, what number is this? 
Bandit: Uh, $300 dollarbucks. Oh, Doreen, you can get more than that... Let's say $900! 
Muffin: $900 dollarbucks. 
Bluey: How much money ya got, Rita? 
Bingo: Pardon? 
Muffin: Hurry up! My hips hurt! 
Bingo: Let me count ma' coins. (does so) One... two... oh, that's a nice-
Muffin: Hurry up! 
Bingo drops her purse, spilling coins everywhere.
Bingo: Oh, my coins. 
Muffin: This is taking too long! Bugalugs, take me home! 
Bandit: Yes, nana. 
Muffin: And watch the CRACKS!
Another laugh.
Bandit: Sorry, nana. 
Muffin stops the play for a beat.
Muffin: Bluey, grouchy granny is a bit too gwouchy. Are you sure there isn't another type of granny? 
Bluey: There might be, but I just don't know what it is. Do you?
Muffin: Hmm... no. I'll stay grouchy granny. 
Bandit: Oh, great.
Muffin: (now the grouchy granny and hitting him with the bag again) You watch yourself, young man! 
Meanwhile, with Chilli, the shopper, and Doreen back at the garage sale...
Doreen: Hmm... how about five dollars? 
Shopper: How about two dollars? 
Doreen: Okay, two dollars. 
Doreen gets handed $2 once again. Chilli sighs.
Chilli: Doreen... If you wanna go on a holiday to the reef, you better toughen up. 
Doreen: Oh, I know...
An old pug walks up, and bumps into a table.
Doreen: Oh, dear. 
Old Pug: The table leg's blocking the footpath. I could've break my leg!
Doreen: Oh, I'm terribly sorry. 
Old Pug: I should call the council. 
Chilli: I'll get it, Doreen. 
Old Pug: Keep that noise down. 
Chilli: I'm sorry? 
Old Pug: I'm not paying for any of this. 
Doreen: Oh, well. That's fine. 
Chilli: Well, I think you should pay a little. 
Old Pug: I think you should mind your own business. 
Chilli: Woah. That is one grouchy granny. 
Muffin gets wheeled back.
Bandit: We're back home, nana. 
Muffin: About time! Now, make me a cup of tea, Bugalugs. 
Old Pug: Hey, you, get off there. 
Muffin: No! It's mine! 
Old Pug: I'm buying it. 
Muffin: Fine. Give me $900 dollars. 
Old Pug: What? The sign says $300. 
Muffin throws the sign away to make her point clear.
Muffin: $900 DOLLARS! 
Old Pug: I'm not payin' 900 dollars!
Muffin: Good. Then I keep it. 
Old Pug: Oh, it's like that, isn't it? 
Bandit: Oh, look, love, I think you want to talk to that lady...
The old pug hits Bandit with her purse.
Old Pug: Get your hands off me! 
Bandit: Ow! What are you doing?
Muffin hits him as well.
Muffin: Where's my cup of tea?!
Bandit: Doreen, I think this delightful lady wants to buy your scooter. 
Old Pug: $100 dollars. 
Doreen: Um, I guess that sounds okay. 
Bandit: Oh, Doreen, you need to go higher than that. 
Old Pug: You need to lay off the biscuits! 
Bandit: What?! (to Chilli) You said I was looking good.
Chilli: You are, honey. Ignore her. 
Old Pug: Oh, nosy neighbor's back. 
Chilli: Now, you listen...
Old Pug: $100 dollars. Take it or leave it. 
Doreen takes the $100.
Chilli: Oh, Doreen, no...
Old Pug: Right. You, off. 
Muffin: No! 
Old Pug: What?!
Muffin: I told you, it's $900 DOLLARS! 
Bandit is now by a mirror, examining his body fat.
Bandit: A lot of this is just water weight. 
Chilli: Muffin, honey, why don't we-
Muffin: Hands off!
Old Pug: Stay out of it, Cattle Dog. $200, final offer. 
Muffin: Ten hundred!
Old Pug: What? You're dreamin'! (pulls out) 500. 
Muffin: Eleven!
Old Pug: Outrageous!
Muffin: If you don't want it, then don't buy it!
Old Pug: I'm not paying eleven hundred dollars!
Muffin: Why not? 
Old Pug: 'Cause it's ugly. Like her hat.
The old pug points to Doreen's hat.
Chilli: Hey, hey!-
 Chilli starts to advance towards the old pug, but Doreen stops her.
Doreen: Hang on, love. Let's see how this plays out. 
Old Pug: And another thing, I don't like the colour. 
Muffin: Well, PAINT IT! 
Old Pug: You paint it. 
Muffin: You paint it! 
Their argument between painting the scooter goes on in the background as Bandit gives his side a tap.
Bandit: Oh yeah, it jiggles. 
It cuts back to Muffin and the old pug.
Muffin: No, YOU paint it! 
Old Pug: Fine. (pulls out...) Eleven hundred. 
Muffin: TWELVE HUNDWED! 
ALL (but Muffin): What?! 
Muffin: And 18 lollies. 
Old Pug: Oh, you cheeky little... fine. $1200 dollars.
Doreen: Oh my goodness! 
Old Pug: And how much are the lollies? 
Chilli: Oh, $2 dollars! 
Old Pug: Oh! 
The old pug drives away in her new scooter. Everyone says goodbye; the old pug blows a raspberry at them.
ALL: Hooray! 
Chilli: You'll be going on that holiday now, Doreen! 
Doreen: Yeah. 
Bandit: I'm gonna do some push-ups. 
Bandit walks off, Muffin has a jar of lollies in her hand.
Muffin: Hm. These lollies are gross! 
Doreen: Muffin, look around. You can pick anything you want. 
Muffin: Really? (tail starts wagging)
Doreen: Yep. You are one in a million. 
Muffin giggles, and spots something she wants. She grabs it, revealing a red tea towel.
Muffin: Can I have this? 
Doreen: Are you sure? Just a tea towel? 
Cut back to Bluey and Bingo. Bingo drops her coins on accident.
Bingo: Aw, ma' coins. 
Muffin runs in, singing.
Bluey: Oh, look, Rita. It's the Super Granny! 
Muffin: May I help you with those coins? 
Bingo: Pardon? 
Back at Doreen's yard, Bandit is doing sit ups.
Doreen: Bandit, I've got one of those exercise thingies if you want. 
Bandit: Oh yeah. How much you want for it? 
Doreen: Oh, I don't know. What do you think? 
Bandit: 20 bucks? 
Doreen: Hmm... 50! 
Bandit: Ha! Doreen! 
Chilli: That's my girl. 
Episode ends. The old pug drives past the credits.
