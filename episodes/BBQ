The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. On the deck, Bandit is setting up a barbecue, while Bluey copies him with a fake barbecue made from a bench, a rugby ball, and some trays. They both move their barbecues onto place, take the lids off, clean the grill by scraping it, turn on the gas, and turn the knob, only for nothing to happen.
Bandit: "Ugh, come on!"
Bluey: "Oh, come on!"
Bandit: "Come on, start!"
Bluey: "Start! Come on!"
Bandit: "Come on, you heap of junk!"
Bluey: "Come on! Heap of junk!"
The barbecue finally lights with a whoosh.
Bluey: "Whoosh!"
Bluey, Bandit: "There it goes."
TITLE CARD - a hat with various plants inside it and the episode title
Bingo : This episode of Bluey is called: BBQ!"
Later, the barbecue is in full swing. Bandit is cooking sausages while Stripe stands nearby with a beer. Chilli and Trixie are setting the table with plates and sauce. Bluey is cooking at her pretend barbecue. Muffin and Socks are sitting next to Bluey with a bench as the table.
Chilli: (to Trixie) (laughs) "You've got to."
Bandit: (to Stripe) "And they're blowing the whistle, the farmer's yelling, 'It's dog versus sheep.'"
Stripe: "Oh, wow."
Chilli: (to Trixie) Don't you hate that dog shampoo? But it does get the ticks."
Bingo carries a small deck chair over to the bench and sets two plates up in front of Muffin and Socks.
Bingo: "There, table set."
Bluey: "Almost ready with the sausages, kids."
Muffin: "I love sausages!"
Socks: (barks excitedly)
Bingo: "This is my relaxing chair. It's where I relax."
Bingo sits on her chair.
Bingo: "Ah! So relaxing."
Chilli puts a bowl of salad on the table and Trixie brings out some more plates.
Chilli: (to Trixie) Tell me about it! Bandit had one on the back of his ear the other day, he kept going 'Oh! Oh!'"
Muffin looks over at the salad.
Muffin: "We have to have salad with our barbecue!"
Bluey: "You're right, Muffin! Bingo, can you be in charge of the salad?"
Bingo: "Well, I was relaxing in my relaxing chair, but okay."
On the other side of the deck, Bandit is shielding his eyes from the sun. He picks up a hat.
Bandit: "Whew! That sun is hot!"
Bingo: "Can I borrow this, Dad?"
Bingo steals the hat from Bandit and takes it over to the others, putting it on the bench.
Bandit: "Hey!"
Bingo: "Okay, this is the salad bowl."
Bingo sits back down in her chair.
Muffin: "You need to put salad in it!"
Socks: (growl-like barks)
OriginalDisneyMuffin: "I like capsicum salad!"
Bluey: "Ooh, me to! I love capsicum!"
Socks: (barks) "Gleen catsimun."
Muffin: "Socks says she likes green capsicum the best."
Bingo: (sighs) "Uh, okay. I can get green capsicum. Green is easy."Muffin: "I like pepper salad!"
Bluey: "Ooh, me to! I love peppers!"
Socks: (barks) "Gleen peppah."
Muffin: "Socks says she likes green peppers the best."
Bingo: (sighs) "Uh, okay. I can get green pepper. Green is easy."
Bingo runs over to some succulents elsewhere on the deck. She reaches out to the first one, but it pricks her with a thorn.
Bingo: "Aah! Thorns! Oh, here we go."
She walks over to the next one and pulls off a leaf, but it has a bug on it. The bug screams, and Bingo hastily throws the leaf away.
Bingo: "Eek! Bug!"
The bug lands on Bandit's nose.
Bandit: "And he was going- Aaahh! Get it off!"
Bandit frantically knocks the bug from his nose to his foot. Stripe laughs. Meanwhile, Bingo is onto the third succulent, which she picks some leaves and stems from.
Bingo: "Oh, this one's okay."
Bingo runs back and puts the leaves in the hat.
OriginalDisneyBingo: "There. Green capsicum salad."
She sits down in her chair again.
Bingo: "Ahhh, so relaxing."
Bluey: "Can I have some yellow capsicum? Yellow's my favourite colour capsicum."
Bingo sighs and gets out of her chair again.
Bingo: "Hmm, yellow capsicum."Bingo: "There. Green pepper salad."
She sits down in her chair again.
Bingo: "Ahhh, so relaxing."
Bluey: "Can I have some yellow pepper? Yellow's my favourite colour pepper."
Bingo sighs and gets out of her chair again.
Bingo: "Hmm, yellow pepper."
Suddenly, she sees a hanging basket with yellow flowers in it. Bingo squees and runs over to get the flowers from it, but it's too high up for her to reach. She jumps and tiptoes, but that doesn't work either.
Bingo: "Almost..."
Bingo runs over to Bandit, who just picked up his beer from a bench. Bingo takes that bench.
Bandit: "He doesn't listen to the farmer, he goes straight for the sheep."
Stripe: "Oh, no way."
Bingo: "Just borrowing this, Dad."
Bandit: "Gets five of 'em, They're up over it. They're in the truck..."
Bandit goes to put his beer down on the bench, but it just falls on the ground and spills. Stripe laughs.
Bandit: "Hey!"
Bingo drags the bench over to the hanging basket, groaning.
Bingo: "It's so heavy! There."
Bingo gets the bench in place and is about to get the flowers, but Chilli comes along and takes her off it.
Chilli: "That's not safe, Bingo."
Bingo: "Aah! Aah! Mum!"
Chilli returns the bench to the table. Bingo looks around and sees a tennis ball on the ground.
Bingo: "Ooh!"
Bingo picks up the tennis ball and grunts, throwing it at the hanging basket. It hits, causing lots of flowers and petals to fall out. The tennis ball ricochets and hits a can of beer that Bandit just cracked open, causing it to spill.
Bandit: "And then- hey!"
Stripe: (laughs)
Bandit: "Bingo!"
Bingo: "Got it! Sorry, Dad."
Bingo picks up the flowers and petals, and puts them in the hat with the succulent leaves.
OriginalDisneyBingo: "Here you go. Yellow capsicum."
Socks: (happy barks)
Bingo: "Now I'm gonna relax."
Bingo sits down in her chair again and sighs. Muffin looks at the collection of "capsicums."
Muffin: "My favourite capsicum is red capsicum."
Bingo: "Red capsicum?!"
Bingo groans and gets out of her chair again.
Bingo: "There's no red plants around, though, Muffin."
Muffin: "Yes, there is. In that tree."
Buffin points to the poinciana tree in the backyard.
Bingo: "Oh yeah! The poinciana!"
Bingo runs down to the backyard, squealing, and grabs a rake lying on the ground. She uses it to tru to whack some flowers out of the tree, but instead hits seed pods. Lots of seed pots come falling out all around Bingo.
Bingo: "Ah! Ah! Aaahh! Red capsicum!!"Bingo: "Here you go. Yellow pepper."
Socks: (happy barks)
Bingo: "Now I'm gonna relax."
Bingo sits down in her chair again and sighs. Muffin looks at the collection of "peppers."
Muffin: "My favourite color pepper is red pepper."
Bingo: "Red pepper?!"
Bingo groans and gets out of her chair again.
Bingo: "There's no red plants around, though, Muffin."
Muffin: "Yes, there is. In that tree."
Buffin points to the poinciana tree in the backyard.
Bingo: "Oh yeah! The poinciana!"
Bingo runs down to the backyard, squealing, and grabs a rake lying on the ground. She uses it to tru to whack some flowers out of the tree, but instead hits seed pods. Lots of seed pots come falling out all around Bingo.
Bingo: "Ah! Ah! Aaahh! Red pepper!!"
She gives one of the pods a really strong whack, which sends it spinning through the air and into Bandit's head, making him drop and spill yet another beer.
Bandit: "I mean- (grunts)
Stripe laughs again. Bandit leans over the deck to talk to Bingo.
Bandit: "Bingo! What are you doing?"
Bingo: (yells from the backyard) "I'm making a salad!!"
Bandit: (backing off) "Okay!"
Bingo, now panting and covered in leaves, petals, and twigs, whacks the tree one more time, causing some flowers to fall down.
Bingo: "Yaa! Yeah!"
Bingo picks up the flowers and runs upstairs to the deck, putting them in with all the other plants.
OriginalDisneyBingo: (panting) "There. Red capsicum."
Muffin: "Yeah!"
Bingo: (panting) "I don't think there's any more colours of capsicum left. So, now... I want to... I'm just gonna relax... in my relaxer chair..."Bingo: (panting) "There. Red pepper."
Muffin: "Yeah!"
Bingo: (panting) "I don't think there's any more colours of pepper left. So, now... I want to... I'm just gonna relax... in my relaxer chair..."
Bingo collapses into her chair and sighs deeply. Meanwhile, Chilli is putting dressing on the salad with Trixie watching.
Trixie: "Ooh, I like that salad dressing, Chilli."
Chilli: "Yeah, thanks, I made it myself. It's Auntie Mary's recipe."
Muffin looks at the dressing, then looks at the flower salad in front of her.
Muffin: "We need salad dressing!"
Socks: (howls)
Bingo: (panting) "Ughhhhh, okay."
Over on the other side of the deck, Bandit has a bottle of water in his hand.
Stripe: "So what did you do?"
Bandit: "Well..."
Bingo: "Can I borrow this, Dad?"
Bingo runs over and takes the bottle of water from Bandit.
Bandit: "Hey!"
Stripe: (chuckles)
Down in the backyard, Bingo runs to a tap, dumping the water out of the bottle as she goes. She starts to scoop up mud from a little patch near the hose nozzle into the bottle.
Bingo: "Mud. More mud. Oh, we're out of mud. I'll have to make some more."
Bingo runs to the tap and tries to turn it on.
Bingo: "Dad! Which way do I turn on the hose?"
She keeps trying.
Bingo: "Dad!"
Bandit and Stripe turn around to look down at Bingo.
Bandit: "Yes, Bingo?"
Suddenly, the hose turns on, spraying Stripe in the face and making him drop and spill his beer. Bandit laughs.
Bingo: "Don't worry, I got it working!"
Bingo aims the hose down into the dried-up mud patch, creating more mud.
Bingo: "There, now I'll fill up my jar."
She goes to put the hose down.
Bingo: "I'll just put this down here- AAAAAHHH!!"
The hose starts spraying wildly, showering the deck with rain.
Muffin: "It's raining!"
Bandit and Stripe dodge the blast from the hose as Bluey, Muffin, and Socks run up to them, laughing and howling.
Stripe: "Bingo, what are you doing down there??"
Bandit: "Bingo, grab the hose!"
Bingo: "I'm trying!!"
Bingo screams and giggles as the hose starts directly spraying her.
Bingo: "It's tickling my bottom!"
Bandit: "Forget the hose!"
Stripe: "Turn off the tap!"
Bingo runs to the tap and starts turning it.
Bandit: "No, no, no! The other way! Right to tight!"
Bingo: "Got it!"
Bingo, now covered with mud and grass bits, successfully turns off the tap. Bluey, Bandit, Muffin, and Stripe cheer, Socks howls.
Bingo: "My goodness. This is not relaxing."
Bingo runs back upstairs, tracking muddy footprints through the house, up to the deck with the bottle of mud She slams it onto the bench with the rest of the salad.
Bingo: (frustrated) Salad dressing! Now I'm going to sit in my relaxer chair and relax! Hmm!"
Bingo collapses into her chair yet again. She closes her eyes, but is startled by Chilli's voice.
Chilli: (offscreen)(angrily) Whose muddy footprints are these?!"
Cut to Bingo using the mop to clean up her footprints. Later, Muffin and Socks have cleared the salad and dressing off the bench to make way for Bluey's "sausages".
Muffin: "More sausages please, Bluey."
Bluey: "Here you go."
Muffin: "Thank you."
Bingo finishes clearing up the muddy footprints and leans the mop against the bench.
Bingo: "Phew, finally! I get to relax!"
Bingo falls into her chair again, and sighs. Over at the barbecue, Bandit has finished cooking. Stripe eats a sausage, and quickly realises it's too hot to eat yet.
Bandit: "Sausages are ready!"
Bluey and Muffin: "Sausages!"
Socks: (howls)
Bingo: "Oh."
Later, the table is fully set and everyone except Bandit is sitting around it; Stripe tries feeding a hard-boilded egg to Muffin, only for her to refuse and Trixie scratches Socks back. Chilli finishes placing the salads down (with Bluey's help) when Bandit enters with a large tray of sausages.
Bandit: "Out of the way, salads!"
Bandit pushes the salad bowls aside to make room for the sausages. Everyone except Bingo and Bandit starts complimenting Bandit on the sausages.
(simultaneously)
Stripe: "Ahaha! Looks good, Bandit! Look at those!"
Chilli: "Oooh! she takes a sniff They look delicious, Bandit."
Trixie: "Woah! Well done, Bandit!"
Muffin: "Yay! Thanks Uncle Bandit!"
Bluey: "Good one, Dad! Oh, they look great!"
Socks: (happy pants and barks)
Bandit: "Why thank you. Thank you very much."
Bingo, however, is frustrated.
Bingo: (annoyed) "Isn't anyone going to mention the salads??"
Pause. Everyone looks around nervously, before starting to praise Chilli and her salads.
(simultanously)
Bandit, Trixie and Bluey start clapping while Stripe and Muffin cheer
Bandit: "Oh, excellent salads! Oh, look at the greenery!"
Trixie: "Oh, yes! Excellent salads, Chilli!"
Stripe: "Yeah!!! Check it out kids, look how good they look!"
Muffin: "Yeah!!! (starts clapping happily) Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Bluey: "Oh yes, excellent salad, Mum."
Socks: (happy howls and pants)
Chilli: (laughing) "Thank you, thank you."
They all laugh, Stripe affectionately rubbing the top of Bingo's head. Chilli hugs Bingo.
Chilli: "Thanks, Bingo. Now relax."
Chilli hands Bingo a sausage sandwich, which Bingo happily takes and eats.
Bingo: "Om-yum-yum!"
The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a chill groove with marimba and flute. Bluey is dancing.
