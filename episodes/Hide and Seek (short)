Opening
Guests are shown into an un-themed waiting room. The attraction begins with an introduction video played on the wall.
In the living room, Bandit lays back on the couch, reading a newspaper.
Bandit: "Ah... ah, man. Chill the beans."
Bingo runs in, holding a toy microphone. Bluey runs in behind her, holding a toy speaker.
Bingo: "Ladies and Gentlemen!"
Bandit puts down the newspaper.
Bandit: "Aw, biscuits!"
Bingo: "Ready?"
Bluey: "Ready, Bingo!"
Bandit: "Ready? For what?"
Bluey climbs over the couch, stepping on Bandit's stomach on the way.
Bandit: "Oof!"
Bluey pops back up from behind the couch.
Bluey: "The most amazing hide-and-seek... ever."
Bluey presses a button on the speaker. Bluey and Bingo both smile oddly and move their heads from side to side in time with the recorded message.
Speaker: "Oh yeah!"
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Chilli enters the room.
Chilli: "What's going on in here?"
Bandit: "The most amazing hide-and-seek... ever."
Chilli: "Ooh, sounds exciting. So, how does this work, exactly?"
Bingo: "You'll see!"
Bluey presses a button on the speaker. Again, they both smile oddly and move their heads from side to side.
Speaker: "It's go time!"
Bandit: "That sounds... ominous. Can I play it from the couch?"
Bluey, Bingo: "No!"
Bandit: "Hm... how about the floor next to the couch?"
Bluey, Bingo: "No!"
Bandit: "Well, in that case, I respectfully decline."
Bluey: "Oh, pleeease?"
Bluey and Bingo both put on their please faces.
Bandit: "Oh, don't use your please face!"
Cut to Bandit's point of view, as Bluey and Bingo make their please faces directly to the camera.
Bandit: (defeated) "Okay, fine."
Chilli covers her eyes with her hands.
Chilli: "Now girls, should we close our eyes and count to ten while you go hide?"
The girls run into the sun room, squealing. Bingo runs over Bandit's stomach as she exits.
Bandit: "Oof!"
Chilli: "Girls?"
Chilli uncovers her eyes.
Chilli: "Oh. They're gone. I'm talking to no one."
Bandit: "Hi, Talking to No One. I'm Bandit."
Chilli rolls her eyes. Bandit looks pleased with himself.
Bluey and Bingo can be heard giggling from another room. Bandit and Chilli look at each other.
TITLE CARD - Hide and Seek
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: The Most Amazing Hide and Seek... Ever!"
As Bluey speaks, words are added to the title card in marker, leaving the final title "The most Amazing Hide and Seek EVER!"
Downstairs
Guests are then set free to explore a replica of several rooms of the Heeler's house. The kitchen/dining area, living room, and Bluey and Bingo's bedroom. In addition to the show-accurate props and Easter eggs, and a slide in the bedroom, there are several screens playing animations.
A screen in a kitchen cupboard shows Bluey and Bingo crawling past.
A screen in a living room window periodically shows Bandit and Chilli searching the yard.
The living room TV shows a rugby game.
Outdoors
After the bedroom, guests find several small outdoor-themed areas. One appears to be a campsite, and another, hosting a stuffed kiwi, appears to represent New Zealand.
One area contains a pillow fort, with a screen showing Bluey hiding in the fort. A moment later, Chilli pokes her head in and looks around. She appears to have dialogue which was not audible.
Downstairs
Re-entering the house, guests can explore Bandit's office, a cardboard fort built in the entrance, the playroom, and the back yard
A screen on the upper floor of the cardboard fort shows Bluey and Bingo sliding open a panel to look around, then closing it again.
A screen in the cloth wall of the play house shows Bluey and Bingo pushing the cloth aside, smiling at each other, and then closing it again.
Closet
At the end of the experience, a cupboard is opened up, and guests are directed into a walk-in closet with shirts on hangars and cardboard storage boxes.
A screen shows Chilli and Bandit, searching through a rack of clothes.
Chilli sighs. They stop looking.
Chilli: "Guess we'll have to go out for ice cream by ourselves."
Bluey and Bingo: (distantly) "What?!"
Bandit and Chilli grin.
Bandit: "Ohhh, great idea. I'll have the double choc chip with marshmallows and sprinkles!"
Bluey and Bingo's dialogue is inaudible. Bandit and Chilli grin again.
Chilli: "Well, I guess we could look a little more. What do you think, Dad?"
Bandit: "Hm... let's do it."
Bandit and Chilli: "One! Two! Three! Here we come!"
Bandit and Chilli walk through the door. Guests follow them, to a small set of the front yard, where Bluey and Bingo are waiting to meet guests as costumed characters.
From there, guests exit back to the backyard, and from there into the garage, which serves as the gift shop.
