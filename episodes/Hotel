The episode opens with Bluey and Bingo hiding underneath a bedsheet, Bingo giggling.
Bluey: "Shhh!"
An unseen door opens.
Chilli: (offscreen) "Bandit, I'm just having a quick shower, then I'll give you a hand cleaning the room."
Bandit: (offscreen) "All good, I've got it covered."
The door closes and the shower starts running.
Bandit: "Now, where are those naughty kids?"
Bingo giggles again. Suddenly, Bandit pulls the sheet off.
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bandit: "Oh, whoa, here they are!"
Bluey: "Do that again!"
Bluey and Bingo giggle as Bandit puts the sheet over his kids and removes it repeatedly.
Bandit: "Kids, no kids. Kids, no kids. Kids, no kids."
Bluey: "Let's play Hotels!"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bandit: "Oh no, not Hotels."
TITLE CARD - Hotel
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called: Hotel."
Cut to the verandah. Bluey cuts out squares of paper, and Bingo writes numbers on them with crayon. Cut to the upstairs hallway; Bingo sticks the number "5" on a door. Cut to the laundry room. Bluey dumps out a basket of laundry on the floor.
Cut to the top of the stairs. Bluey sets the laundry basket upside-down in front of a book. She sits on the book, using the laundry basket as a desk. Bingo stands against the wall. Bandit walks up the stairs, carrying a cloud-and-rainbow bag, whistling.
Bluey: "Oh, Bingo, we have a guest!"
Bingo: "I want to be a crazy pillow!"
Bluey: "No, you're the crazy hotel helper."
Bingo: "Aw..."
Bandit arrives at the top of the stairs.
Bandit: "Hello!"
Bluey: "No, Dad, you have to push the bell."
Bandit: "Oh, okay."
Bandit taps the top of Bingo's head.
Bingo: (shouting) "DIIIING!!"
Bluey and Bandit recoil. Bandit covers his ears.
Bandit: "Ahhh!! I might just fix that bell's volume."
Bandit makes a twisting motion on the top of Bingo's head.
Bandit: "There. Let's try again."
Bandit taps the top of Bingo's head.
Bingo: "Ding!"
Bandit: "That's better."
Bluey: "Hello, how are you? We are very nice."
Bandit: "I'm good. I'd like a room, please."
Bluey: "Oh yes, we have some rooms."
Bandit: "One with a TV."
Bluey: "Oh yes, sure. This way, please."
Bluey indicates behind her. Bandit walks in that direction.
Bandit: "Thank you!"
Bluey: "Bingo, grab his suitcase."
Bingo: "No, my name is Slobberdobber."
Bluey: "Oh yes. Grab his suitcase, Slobberdobber."
Cut to Bluey leading Bandit through the halls. The doors have consecutive numbers stuck to them. Bingo is straining with the effort of dragging along the rainbow bag. She slowly falls behind.
Bandit: "I have an important cleaning job to do in the morning, so it's very important that I am not disturbed."
Bluey: "Oh, of course."
Bluey opens the door on the kids' room.
Bluey: "We have this lovely room. It has the sleepy bunny night-light and some toys."
Bandit: "Hmm, no thanks."
Bluey and Bandit leave the kids' room and enter the study.
Bluey: "We also have this room."
Bandit: "Hmm, maybe too many computers and not enough beds."
Bluey and Bandit leave that room and come to a door labelled "6".
Bluey: "And we have this room."
She opens the door to reveal Bingo sitting on the toilet with the cloud bag.
Bingo: "Hey! Do you mind?"
Bluey giggles.
Bandit: "Oh, no. Too stinky."
Bluey leads Bandit into the parents' room.
Bluey: "And this is the big room. It has a bed, and a TV. Oh, and there's a lady in the shower. Is that okay?"
Bandit presses down on the bed a few times, then climbs in.
Bandit: "This will do nicely. Goodnight!"
Bandit pretends to fall asleep and snore, but quickly stops.
Bandit: "Hmm. This pillow isn't very comfy."
Bluey: "Yes it is."
Bandit: "Oh, okay."
He returns to his snoring. Bluey quietly goes to leave, but Bingo suddenly and loudly enters, waking Bandit up.
Bingo: "Yarp! Yarp! Yarp!"
Bluey: "Crazy helper!"
Bluey picks up Bingo, covering her mouth as she carries her out of the room, leaving the cloud bag lying on the ground.
Bluey: "Okay, see you in the morning, sir."
Bandit: "Yes, please see that I am not disturbed until then."
Bluey: "Oh, of course. My helper won't be crazy at all."
Bandit: "Oh, I'm sure she won't."
Suddenly, Bingo runs back in.
Bingo: "Yaaarp!"
Bluey runs in after her and covers her mouth again, closing the door quietly. Bandit continues to "sleep" for a bit, until Bingo again bursts in - this time with a party horn and a broom. She blows the horn and then spits it on the floor.
Bingo: "Me tidy room now!"
Bandit: "What?"
Bingo pulls the sheet of Bandit's bed.
Bingo: "Ya ya ya, yaaaaaa!"
Bingo continues yelling and brandishing her broom as Bluey calmly walks in.
Bluey: "Oh, Slobberdobber! I am terribly sorry about this, sir."
Bandit: "Well I should say so! I have a very important meeting in the morning."
Bluey picks up Bingo and again carries her out of the room.
Bingo: "Do you need a crazy pillow?"
Bluey: "No, he doesn't."
Bingo continues yelling as she's carried out.
Bluey: "This is very embarrassing. It won't happen again."
Bandit: "Well please see that it doesn't."
Bluey leaves the room and closes the door, leaving Bandit alone. He goes to sleep again but Bingo immediately returns, banging a wooden spoon against a cooking pot.
Bingo: "Breakfast time!"
Bandit: "Who, wha..? What?"
Bingo: "Breakfast time! Who wants bacon?!"
Bandit: "But it's the middle of the night!"
Bingo: "Who wants night bacon?!!"
Bluey runs back in.
Bluey: "Slobberdobber! I'm so sorry, sir. This won't happen again."
Bingo: "Supper!!"
Bluey puts Bingo away from Bandit.
Bandit: "Well, night bacon does sound pretty good, actually. As long as I'm up, I might as well watch the news."
Bluey: "Yeah, the news!"
Bluey runs to the foot of the bed. Bingo follows sadly.
Bingo: "Bluey, can I be crazy pillow now?"
Bluey: "Come on, Bingo."
Bingo groans as assumes her place at the foot of the bed.
Bluey: "Try the TV again!"
Bandit: "Okay. Click!"
Bandit pretends to press a button on a remote. A news theme starts playing as Bingo pops up at the foot of the bed as a TV presenter.
Bingo: "Oh, hello. I am the TV. Today on the news..."
Bluey pops up next to her.
Bluey: "A wild storm keeps banging people's heads into the bed!"
Bluey starts pushing Bingo's head into the bed as she giggles.
Bluey: "Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!"
Bingo escapes and picks up Bluey.
Bingo: "Cartoons are on!"
'Bluey moves Bingo back into her original position.
Bluey: "Now, back to the news. We have thunder!"
Bluey starts waving Bingo from side to side as she continues giggling. Bandit looks on.
Bluey: "Boom! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!"
Bingo pushes back, stopping Bluey from moving her.
Bingo: "Bluey, I want to be a crazy pillow."
Bluey: "No, you're the news."
Bingo grunts in frustration. Bluey resumes waving her around.
Bluey: "And lightning! Brrr, boom!"
Bingo pushes Bluey away.
Bingo: "No. I'm not playing. You're bossing me around."
Bingo runs out of the room angrily as Bandit looks on, worried.
Bluey: "Slobberdobber, come back this instant!"
Bandit: "Ah, TV. Always people shouting at each other. Click!"
The news music stops. Bandit gets off the bed.
Bandit: "Alright, kid, I gotta get back to making the bed."
Bluey: "No, Dad, wait! Don't stop! You have to keep playing! We're not finished Hotels!"
Bandit starts smoothing the bedsheets.
Bandit: "Well, you better sort it out with Bingo, kiddo. You have to let her make some decisions too, you know."
Bluey: "Okay."
Bluey runs out, then back in.
Bluey: "Don't start tidying."
In the kids' room, Bingo is lying on her bed, facing the wall. Bluey runs in.
Bluey: "Please, Bingo, you have to keep playing or Dad will stop playing."
Bingo: "I don't wanna play anymore."
Bluey: "Please?"
Bingo: "No!"
Bluey: "Please?"
Bingo: "No!"
Bluey: "Please, Bingo, I'll do anything!"
Bingo: "No!"
Bluey looks down sadly and starts to walk away.
Bluey: "Okay..."
Bingo sits up.
Bingo: "Alright, I'll play."
Bluey: "Really? Yeah!"
Bingo: "But I wanna be a crazy pillow."
Bluey: "Okay."
Bingo: "Yeah! Crazy pillow!"
Bandit has just finished making the bed when Bluey walks back in, carrying Bingo like a pillow.
Bluey: "Hello, sir. I have a new pillow here for you."
Bandit: "Oh, thank you!"
Bandit gets onto the bed.
Bluey: "Don't worry, it's not a crazy pillow."
Bandit: "Well, that's a plus."
He puts his head on Bingo like a pillow.
Bandit: "My oh my, this is very comfortable and not wriggly at all. Okay, well, I best go to sleep now. Night."
He goes back to his snoring. Bingo giggles and tickles his nose. Bandit wakes up and Bingo quickly pretends to be a pillow again.
Bandit: "Uh, ohh, ooh, ah! Tickly nose. Hmm, that's odd."
Bandit goes back to snoring, but Bingo giggles again and crawls away from him, waking him up.
Bandit: "Hey! Pillow! Get back here!"
Bluey and Bingo both start giggling. Bandit puts Bingo back as his pillow.
Bandit: "Now stay there, pillow. And where's my blanket? Ah, there it is!"
He picks up Bluey, using her as a blanket.
Bandit: "Ah, that's better."
He goes back to snoring.
Bluey: "Tickle him!"
Bluey and Bingo begin tickling Bandit.
Bandit: "Ahh! Hey, wait a minute! 
He starts laughing.
Bandit: "Hey, this is a crazy pillow!"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bluey: "And I'm a crazy blanket!"
They both jump off the bed and run away from Bandit.
Bandit: "Aah! Runaway bed stuff! Stop!"
Bandit throws the pillows at Bluey and Bingo.
Bandit: "I'll catch you with my net!"
He throws the bedsheet at them, and they run out of the room.
Bandit: "I'm coming to get you! Stooooop!!"
Bandit runs out of the room too, leaving a mess of all the previous things - the cloud bag, party horn, broom, wooden spoon, pot, pillows, and sheet. After a brief pause, Chilli exits the ensuite with a towel on her head and stares at the messy room.
Chilli: "I thought you were gonna clean the room."
The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a bright tune with violin. Bluey is dancing.
