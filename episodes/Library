The episode opens to a wide shot of Stripe’s car, driving through town in mild rain. The scene quickly cuts to the inside of the car, where Stripe is driving and Muffin, wearing a tiara, is sitting in her harnessed car seat in the back.
Muffin: So that’s why I’m going to write a letter to the toilet fairy.
Stripe: Well, that’s the only way things will change.
Muffin points ahead.
Muffin: Orange light, dad.
Stripe: Oop-
The view cuts back outside briefly; the car simply revs its engine a bit faster and drives through two orange-lighted traffic signals.
Muffin: Dad! You drove through an orange light! 
Stripe: Uh, yeah I did.
Muffin: Didn’t you see it?
Stripe: Yeah, I saw it.
Muffin: But orange light means slow down and stop. Why didn’t you slow down and stop?
Stripe: Uh, well… This was a special case.
Muffin: Oh okay, dad. (pauses as she swings her legs back and forth, then stops) Are you special?
Stripe: Well, a little.
Muffin: Am I special?
The camera shot shows Stripe looking back at Muffin through the rear view mirror.
Stripe: Muffy, you’re the most special kid in the whole world.
Muffin: Ooh, interesting.
The scene moves to the Heeler household’s foyer. Muffin is loudly knocking on the door as Chilli is approaching with a folded towel. 
Muffin: (through the door) Open the door!
Chilli: Okay, okay, coming.
Chilli opens the door for Muffin, whose feet are muddy.
Muffin: Hello!
Chilli sets the towel down in front of the doorway.
Chilli: Hi, Muffin.
Muffin proceeds to walk right inside, across the towel and tracking mud in her steps.
Chilli: Oh, wipe your feet on the towel, honey! It’s a bit-
Muffin: I don’t have to, Aunt Chilli, I’m special.
Chilli: Okay…
Stripe soon comes to the door afterward, carrying Muffin’s Cat Squad toy motorcycle under his arm. He stops on the towel and wipes his muddy feet on it.
Stripe: Hey, Chilli dog!
Chilli: Stripe.
Chilli and Stripe exchange cheek kisses.
Stripe: Bit muddy out there.
Chilli’s expression lowers disapprovingly.
TITLE CARD - A pinkish purple book with its spine facing to the left stacked on top of a lime green book facing the other way, and the episode title.
Muffin : This episode of Bluey is called Library.
The scene enters the Heeler’s living room, set up to play “Library”. Many books are placed on the couch and a few more are propped up on the TV stand, where Bingo is standing. A drawing of someone yelling crossed out is taped to the arm of the couch. The yellow chair has been moved to the opposite side of the room and a circle of stuffed animals (Polly Puppy, a yellow bear with a red bowtie, Sir Frogdog, a blue whale, a brown racoon, and a purple octopus with a bowler hat) are positioned around it. A bean bag is in the middle of the room. The other side of the room now features a low coffee table, a cardboard box with a piece of paper taped on top, and an end table with its drawer removed and set behind it. Bluey is moving books from a cart to the couch as Muffin enters.
Muffin: Hi Bluey! Hi Bingo!
Bluey and Bingo: Hi Muffin!
Muffin: What are you playing?
Bluey: We’re playing library. I’m the library lady.
Bluey moves over to the coffee table. On top, two books, one pink and one green, are positioned like an open laptop, the green book “lid” supported by a wooden block. A tennis ball is set on top of a pink cylinder pencil case with a purple zipper and yellow flowers. To the other side of the table is a lime green book, a teal stamper, a red pencil, and three index cards: one orange and the other two pink.
Bluey: I’m the library lady. This is my desk. I’ve got a stamp (presses the stamp on one of the pink index cards leaving a blue heart print) and a computer.
Bluey moves over to the cardboard box, grabbing the lime green book and passing it across.
Bluey: And this is the book dooter where you get your book out.
Bluey pushes the book through the end table and drops it into the pushed-out drawer.
Bluey: And here’s where you return those books.
Muffin: Oh.
The camera cuts briefly to the drawing taped to the couch as Bluey points to it.
Bluey: This is a sign to say, “No talking loud.” And that’s it. (hesitates) Oh, wait! These are the books.
Bluey gestures to the wooden cart of books. Bingo is now sitting in the bean bag with a book and Poppy at her side.
Muffin: Wow!
Bingo: Shh!
Muffin: Can I play?
Bluey: Sure. Let’s get you a library card.
Muffin: (yelling) Okay!!
Bingo: Shhh!
The scene cuts to Bluey at her desk, pretending to type on her “computer” and adjusting the tennis ball on top of the pencil case.
Bluey: I’ll just take your picture. Look into this and smile.
As Muffin smiles widely, Bluey makes a camera shutter sound.
Bluey: Excellent.
Bluey types on the “computer” again briefly before moving to an orange index card and drawing Muffin on it.
Bluey: Just waiting for it to be ready. (hands the card to Muffin) There you go.
Muffin: I want a pink one!
Bingo: Shh!
Bluey: (whispering) Library cards are orange.
Muffin: But I want a pink one!
Bluey: (grabs the card back) Okay, I’ll do a pink one. Feel free to choose some books. Just remember to keep quiet.
Muffin: Okay.
As Muffin rushes off, Bluey starts redrawing Muffin onto a pink index card. Meanwhile, Bingo is turning the page of a pop up book to a blue bird-like dinosaur and a fish jumping out of the water.
Bingo: Ooh!
Muffin: (yelling from off screen) Books!
Muffin scoots into frame on her electronic Cat Squad bike, currently flashing lights and playing music, and bumps into Bingo’s bean bag. Bingo folds her ears down.
Cat Squad Bike: Cat Squad is here! (Muffin pushes the button at the front) Cat Squad is here!
Muffin: Cat Squad! (pumps her fist in the air)
Bingo: Muffin, shoosh!
Cat Squad Bike: (Muffin pushes the button again) Fear not! We are here for your purr-tection! Meow!
Muffin mouths the final “meow”, as Bluey approaches.
Bluey: Muffin!
Muffin: (pretending to rev the bike by leaning back) Vroom!
Bluey: (pushes the bike away) You can’t ride the Cat Squad bike into the library!
Muffin: Yes, I can! (leans back again) Vroom!
Muffin pushes the button on the front, causing it to play louder music. Bingo folds her ears down again.
Bingo: Stop it! Cut it out!
Bluey reaches under the Cat Squad bike to flip the off switch.
Muffin: Hey!
Bluey: (turning to Bingo) I’m sorry, library customer. (turns back to Muffin and hands her the pink index card) Here’s your library card, Muffin.
Muffin: Ooh, pink!
Bluey: Yes, it’s pink.
As Muffin dismounts the bike, Bluey pushes it away from the library area.
Bluey: Now, you can borrow any books you want.
Bingo turns the page of her popup book to a green t-rex and a blue velociraptor.
Bingo: Ooh!
Muffin notices and rushes up to grab the book.
Muffin: I want pop up book!
As Bingo tries to tug the book back away from Muffin, Bluey tries to pull Muffin away.
Bluey: Muffin, you can’t have that one. 
The scene cuts to the kitchen where Chilli and Stripe are each enjoying a mug of coffee at the counter as Muffin enters.
Chilli: But, you know…
Muffin: Dad!
Stripe: Yes, Muffy?
Muffin: Bluey isn’t letting me play library. 
Stripe: Oh.
Chilli and Stripe exchange glances.
Chilli: Bluey!
Bluey and Bingo enter.
Bluey: Yes, Mum?
Chilli: Can you include Muffin in your game, please?
Bluey: We are, but she’s not playing properly.
Stripe: Well, everyone has their own way of playing, Bluey.
Chilli briefly glares at Stripe.
Chilli: Just let Muffin play how she wants, okay honey?
Bluey: Okay…
Bluey dejectedly takes the popup book from Bingo and hands it to Muffin.
Bluey: Here you go.
Muffin: Hooray! (opens the book to the two dinosaurs) Rahhh!
The scene cuts back to the “library” where Bingo is moving three books, one at a time, across the cardboard box “book dooter”.
Bingo. Doot! Doot! Doot!
Bluey: So, Muffin, to borrow books, doot the corner like that.
Muffin: Okay.
Bluey: The library rules are… you can doot three books out at a time.
Bluey yelps as Muffin lifts an entire stack of books and sets them on the counter, moving each one on the stack across the “dooter”.
Muffin: Doot!! Doot!! Doot!!
Bluey: Muffin, that’s too many books.
Muffin: I can play however I want! 
She continues frantically passing the books across while saying “doot”.
Bluey: Oh, yes, I forgot.
The scene cuts to Bluey in the chair opposite the library desk, surrounded by a circle of stuffed toys, now including Bingo with Poppy in her lap.
Bluey: Okay, children, welcome to Toddler Time!
Bingo: (softly, as Poppy) Yay!
Bluey: Now, there aren’t any books left because Muffin has borrowed them all.
The camera zooms out to show Muffin sitting in the bean bag, surrounded by stacks of books. The book she has open has a few sound buttons on the side. She presses one and it makes a zebra’s whooping sound.
Muffin: Zebras are stripy!
Bluey pulls out a book with a scale on the front cover from behind her.
Bluey: But I did find this one in Dad’s office, but it doesn’t have any pictures.
Bingo: Aww…
Bluey: (opening the book) Once upon a time, there was… some words.
Muffin: (repeatedly pressing a button on her book that makes a cat's meow) Cat!
Bluey: And then there were some more words.
Muffin: (presses a button that plays an elephant’s trumpet) Elephant!
Bingo: Shh!
Muffin silently stands up and approaches with her book.
Muffin: Lion hungry!
Muffin presses a button that plays a lion’s roar and shuts the book on Poppy’s head, running away with both in tow. Bingo tries to reach out for her.
Bingo: Poppy!
Bluey: I’m sorry, children, but she’s allowed to do that.
The scene cuts to the library counter as Bluey claps for attention.
Bluey: Attention, library customers, your books are due back now. Please put them in the book mouth thing. 
Bingo pushes her one book through the open desk.
Bluey: Thank you! You, too, Muffin.
Muffin opens her book, which plays “The Ants Go Marching”.
Muffin: No, I’m keeping them!
Bluey: You can’t keep library books, Muffin. If you don’t return them, other people can’t borrow them.
Muffin shuts and reopens her book, restarting the song.
Muffin: Everyone else has to return them but I get to keep them.
Bingo: Why do you get to keep them?
Muffin: ‘Cause I am the most special kid in the world!
Muffin closes and opens the book again.
Bluey: That’s it. (holds the book shut) You can be noisy, you can borrow all the books. You can even eat toddlers. But, you have to return your books. Otherwise, you’re not playing library properly.
After a brief bit of silence, Muffin reopens the book, restarting the music.
The scene cuts back to the kitchen as Bluey and Bingo enter dejectedly, sitting down under the counter.
Stripe: Couple of weeks later, and it’s still there.
Chilli: (notices Bluey and Bingo) What’s up, gang?
Bluey: Muffin’s not playing properly.
Chilli turns around the corner of the counter and kneels down to the girls’ level.
Chilli: Bluey, we spoke about this. Muffin can play however she wants.
Bluey: But, we’re playing library and she won’t return her books.
Bingo: She said she doesn’t have to follow the library rules.
Chilli: Oh.
Stripe: Did she say why?
Bingo: She says ‘cause she’s the most special kid in the world.
Stripe: (nervously realizing) Oh, oh, okay. I’ll be right back.
Chilli gives him a glare as he leaves the room, finding Muffin in the living room sitting on her Cat Squad bike, surrounded by books, and watching Cat Squad on the television.
Stripe: Hey, Muffy. (turns off the TV and kneels down to Muffin’s level)
Muffin: Hey!
Stripe: You know how I said you’re the most special kid in the world?
Muffin: Yes?
Stripe: Well, you’re not.
Muffin: Oh.
Stripe: I mean, you are to me and your mum. We love you more than anything. But, you’re probably not special to everyone else. 
Muffin: Oh, okay!
Stripe: So, you have to follow the same rules as everyone, okay?
Muffin: Okay, dad! (sets down her book and goes to hug her dad)
Stripe: Thanks, kiddo.
The scene cuts back to the kitchen as Muffin rushes in, followed shortly by Stripe.
Muffin: Bluey! Guess what!
Bluey: What?
Muffin: I’m not special anymore!
Bluey and Bingo: (jumping back up to their feet) Hooray!
Muffin: Can we play library again? I promise I’ll return my books.
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!
The scene cuts back to a montage in the "library". Muffin is pushing books from her stack one at a time through the “book mouth” as Bluey takes them and puts them on her wooden cart.
Bingo is back in the bean bag chair, looking through a new popup book with Poppy, who now has the left side of her head bandaged. She turns the page to a popup of a cockatoo.
Bingo: Ooh!
Muffin is sitting on the couch, reading the green “Ants Go Marching” book. She briefly lowers it to shush the seagull plush sitting next to her.
Finally, the Toddler Time circle resumes, Muffin now joining the circle, as Bluey turns to the last page of a space-themed book.
Bluey: The end.
Bingo (as Poppy) and Muffin: Yay!
The scene cuts back to Stripe driving back home with Muffin in the backseat. Muffin has the animal sound book in her hands. She presses the buttons for the cat’s meow and the zebra’s whoop. 
Stripe: You have a good time with the cousins, Muffy?
Muffin: Yeah, I did!
Stripe: Great.
Muffin: Can we play library when we get home?
Stripe: Sounds good! Oop, orange light.
The camera briefly cuts to an overhead shot showing the car slowly coming to a stop at the traffic signal.
Stripe: Better stop.
Muffin: Good one, dad.
Stripe: Thanks, princess.
During the end credits, the Cat Squad theme song plays as Muffin rides into the scene on her bike. She presses the button a few times and pretends to rev the engine. She starts riding off screen once the Screen Queensland logo appears.
