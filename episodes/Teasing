(Note, originally in the episode, the word "Oogabooger" was used, but it got edited out of the episode due to a complaint from a viewer saying that it had racial connotations and a problematic history for Indigenous Australians. The word got replaced with "Shooby-Doowah", which sounds a lot better in this episode when watching it on ABC iview. This transcript is from the Disney distributed version.)
In the bathroom, Bluey is holding Bingo's toothbrush out of her reach while Bluey is brushing her teeth.
Bluey: Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh!
Bingo: Give it back!
Bluey: Ooh-ooh!
Bingo: Bluey, that's my toothbrush!
Bluey: Ooh-ooh!
TITLE CARD.
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Teasing.
In Bluey and Bingo's bedroom, Bandit is lying on his back on the floor and can hear what is going on in the bathroom.
Bluey: Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh!
Bingo: Give it back.
Bandit: Bluey, stop teasing your sister.
Bluey: But she was teasing me first!
Bingo: You were teasing me second.
Chilli comes in with a hairbrush to brush Bingo's hair.
Chilli: I don't want ANY teasing, first or second.
Bluey: But Dad always teases us!
Bandit sits up.
Bandit: What? Me? When?
Bluey: Like...password.
(In the hallway, Bluey walks to her and Bingo's bedroom, where Bandit is blocking the entrance.)
Bandit: Password.
Bluey: Let me through! (Bluey says this word with a F sound and not the th sound. Bandit corrects the word in the next line) Grr!
Bandit: Sorry. There's highly sensitive information back here. No-one gets through without the password.
Bluey: Uh...coconut?
Bandit: (Mimics Buzzer) Ehh!
Bluey: Fish-fingers?
Bandit: Ehh-uh!
Bluey: Dad!
Back in the bedroom.
Bandit: (Chuckles) Password's not teasing.
Bluey: Password IS teasing.
Bingo: Well, what about name change?
Bandit: Well, what's wrong with name change?
In the kitchen, Bandit does himself a cup of tea with the kids watching.
Bandit: I'm getting a bit sick of your names, kids. I think I'm gonna change 'em.
Bluey: What?
Bandit: From now on, your name is...Sharrilanda.
Bingo: Sharrilanda?
Bandit: And you're called Dennis.
Bluey: Dennis?
Bingo: Dad!
Bandit: Yes, Sharrilanda?
Bingo: My name's not Sharrilanda!
Bandit: Yes, it is, Sharrilanda.
Bluey: I don't wanna be called Dennis!
Bandit: Yes, you do, Dennis!
(Back in the bedroom.)
Bandit: (Chuckles) (Sighs) Sharrilanda. Name change is not teasing. Is it?
Bluey: It is.
Chilli: Well, what about when you pretend to be me?
Bandit: What? I don't pretend to be you.
Bluey and Bingo: Yes you do!
Bingo: All the time. 
Bingo is standing at the top of the stairs.
Bingo: Mum! Mum!
Bandit: What is it Bingo?
Bingo: I didn't say Dad. I said Mum!
Bandit: Oh, OK. I'll go get her. (High-pitched voice) What is it, sweetheart? What is it, my little boo-bear?
Bingo: I SAID, I want Mum!
Bandit: This is Mum! Can't you tell by my lovely voice?
Bingo: Dad!
Bandit: Dad's not here, which is a shame, 'cause he's such a handsome fellow, with big, strong muscles!
Back in the bedroom, Chilli, Bluey and Bingo give Bandit a look which says, "We know that wasn't Mum and you know it."
Bandit: (normal voice) That WAS Mum.
Chilli: No, it wasn't!
Bandit: That's not teasing!
Bluey: Yes, it is.
Bingo: And what about when you say you're going to sell us to the monkey house?
Bandit: I've never said that.
In the car.
Bluey: Dad, where are we going?
Bandit: To the zoo. I'm gonna sell you to the monkey house.
Bingo: What? You're kidding.
Bandit: Probably get about...five bucks for the pair of you.
Bingo: Dad!
Bandit: You'll have to get used to eating bananas all the time. 
Bluey and Bingo are shocked by that statement.
Back in the bedroom.
Bandit: (Laughs) I'd forgotten that.
Bluey: See? Teasing.
Bandit: But you kids love bananas!
Bingo: And what about volume knob?
Bandit: Volume knob isn't teasing! Is it?
On the balcony, Dad is reading his book when Bingo comes out holding toilet paper which trails behind her.
Bingo: Uh, Dad?
Bandit: Yeah, mate?
Bingo: I need you to wipe my bottom.
Bandit: Oh, well I definitely would like to help you wipe your...
Bandit uses his hand to turn an invisible volume knob down to the point where his conversation is silent.
Bingo: Dad! Turn your volume up!
Back in the bedroom.
Bandit: I had a faulty volume knob.
Chilli: Tch! Well, I know one thing that is DEFINITELY teasing.
Bandit: Oh, and what is that?
Chilli, Bandit and Bingo are reading and Bluey is colouring in the lounge, when Bandit farts, which startles them.
Bandit: Oh, Bluey! How could you?
Bluey: Wasn't me! It was YOU!
Chilli whacks Bandit in the arm with her book.
Back in the bedroom.
Bandit: (Clears throat) I maintain my innocence.
Bingo: Well, what about when I ask you to open my ice block?
Bandit: Well, I'm sure I'd just open your ice block and give it straight to you... ?
Bandit and Bingo are walking out of 4Paws to the car. Bingo has an ice block. 4Paws is a reference to 7Eleven.
Bingo: Dad, can you open this?
Bandit: Yep.
After opening Bingo's ice block, Bandit starts licking it, which shocks Bingo.
Bandit: Thanks Bingo!
Bingo gasps.
Bandit: Where's yours?
Back in the bedroom, Chilli does not take it very well.
Chilli: (Gasps) Daddy!
Bandit: (Chuckles) OK, that one probably was teasing. Sorry, Bingo.
Bluey: See?
Chilli: I think you're right, kids. Dad is a big teaser.
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!
Bandit: Hang on, hang on. As usual, you mob are only telling half the story.
Back in the hallway with password.
Bluey: Diplodocus?
Bandit: Ehh-uh!
Bluey: (Sighs frustratedly) That's it! Ah!
Bluey makes her move to go into her bedroom while Bandit tries to prevent her from going in.
Bandit: Hey! You can't get through here without a password! (Bluey Laughs) (Groans) Intruder! Intruder! (Bluey Squeals) Wait! Ooh! This isn't fair!
Bluey: (Blows raspberry) Ha-ha!
Back in the kitchen, Bandit has put butter on a piece of toast. Bluey and Bingo giggle and laugh.
Bandit: Do you want jam or peanut butter, Sharrilanda?
Bingo: I'd like...honey please, Shooby Doowha.
Bandit: Shooby Doowha? Who's Shooby Doowha?
Bluey: You are!
Bandit: What!? Since when?
Bingo: We changed your name!
Bandit: You can't change my name!
Bluey: Yes, we can, Shooby Doowha!
Bandit: Hey!
Bingo: More honey, please, Shooby Doowha.
Bandit: My name's not Shooby Doowha! Grr!
Bluey and Bingo scream and run away from Bandit.
Back upstairs with Bandit pretending to be Chilli, Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: (High pitched voice) But my favourite thing about your father would be those rippling calf muscles he has! (Bandit notices Bluey and Bingo.) Aaah!
Bingo: Hi Mum!
Bandit: (High-pitched voice) Oh, hello Bingo.
Bluey: Come with us, MUM.
Bingo: We just need to do some things.
Bandit: Oh, um, well, I do need to get to work.
In the ensuite, Bluey and Bingo work on modelling Bandit to look like a mother. We hear their voices coming from the closed door.
Bingo: More lipstick, I think, Mum.
Bluey: Oh, this handbag really suits you Mum.
Bandit: Oh, um...I guess it does set off my eyes.
In the kitchen, Chilli is working when she sees the makeover that Bluey and Bingo did to Bandit.
Bingo: Oh, look. It's another Mum.
Chilli: Oh, dear.
Bandit: How do you remove make-up?
In the car, Bluey and Bingo are acting like monkeys making monkey noises, which is bothering Bandit and Chilli.
Chilli: Well, this got out of hand.
Bandit: Alright, you kids! Settle down.
Bluey: No! We're not kids, we're monkeys! You said so!
Bluey and Bingo continue acting like monkeys to the disappointment of Bandit and Chilli.
Back with volume knob with Bandit and Bingo. Bandit's conversation is still silent.
Bingo: Dad! (Giggles) Got the volume knob. Volume turning up!
Bandit: Oh, you...!
Bingo: THIS IS ME WITH MY VOLUME UP!
Bandit: Ah! Not so loud!
Bingo: I NEED YOU TO WIPE MY BOTTOM!
Back in the bedroom, everyone is laughing.
Bluey: We always beat you.
Bandit: Yeah, you kids are way too clever for me.
Chilli: Clearly from my side of the family.
Bandit: You know what i've learned?
Bluey: What?
Bandit: The difference between playing and teasing is...
(Bingo turns down Dad's invisible volume knob. We do not hear what he says, but it gets a laugh from Chilli, Bluey and Bingo.)
Back at 4Paws with Bandit and Bingo, Bandit gives Bingo her ice block back.
Bandit: Sorry, kiddo. That was a bit mean.
Bingo: That's OK... ...Shooby Doowha.
Bandit: Hey!
Bingo laughs while Bandit shakes his head and has a cheeky smile.
