The episode opens on an establishing view of the 1 William Street skyscraper from Clem Jones Promenade next to Neville Bonner Bridge during dusk.
Cut to Marcus standing behind a lectern in an auditorium room.
Marcus: "...And now please welcome, Doctor Bandit Heeler; fresh from the fields to discuss his latest archaeological discovery."
Marcus exits to the left as the audience applauds and Bandit enters from the right to stand behind the lectern.
A moment later, Bandit ahem-coughs and the applauding ceases.
Bandit: "Good evening!"
With his left paw, Bandit holds up a femur bone he was hiding behind his back.
Bandit: "Behold, the only known fossil of the first dog to walk upright, the ancestor of us all."
The audience audibly awes in excitement and applauds.
Bandit: "This bone belonged to an early canid that walked the Earth over four million years ago."
The audience applauds. Bandit nods with his eyes closed. 
Cut to the projector screen now showing a drawing of an ancient dog who is standing upright and has a limb feline looking creature being held on the left shoulder. 
Bandit: "Our reconstruction suggests this species was a primitive but intelligent tool maker."
Cut back to Bandit.
Bandit: "Note the derived morphology of the femur, its pronounced robusticity, and rugged muscle attachments: This mosaic of characters is indisputable evidence for bipedal locomotion and evolutionary descend from a quadrupedal antecedent!"
The audience applauds accompanied by whistles. Bandit smirking and adjusting his access badge on his chest.
Bandit: "This is a singular find of unprecedented significance for our understanding of the origin of modern dogs; it is a rare relic from our distant past."
The audience bursts into roaring applauds.
Bandit gives few approval nods, and the room falls silent aside for the ventilation machinery.
Bandit slightly glances at the bone and looks back at his audience becoming visibly nervous. He moves his focus between the audience and the bone twice more...
-And suddenly pounces to furiously gnaw the bone accompanied by loud clattering and onomatopoeia.
Bandit: (growlingly) "Yum-yumyumyumyum! (inhales) H-yum-yum-"
