The episode opens on an establishing shot of the 1 William Street skyscraper from Clem Jones Promenade next to Neville Bonner Bridge during dusk.
Cut to a lecture hall. Marcus stands behind a lectern.
Marcus: "...And now, please welcome Doctor Bandit Heeler, fresh from the fields to discuss his latest archaeological discovery."
Marcus exits to the left as the audience applauds and Bandit enters from the right to stand behind the lectern.
A moment later, Bandit coughs to clear his throat, and the applause ends.
Bandit: "Good evening!"
With his left paw, Bandit holds up a femur bone he was hiding behind his back.
Bandit: "Behold, the only known fossil of the first dog to walk upright – the ancestor of us all."
The audience gasps in excitement and applauds.
Bandit: "This bone belonged to an early canid that walked the Earth over four million years ago."
The audience applauds. Bandit nods sagely. 
Cut to the projector screen now showing a black-and-white drawing of a dog with prominent brow ridges. It carries a limp cat over its right shoulder.
Bandit: "Our reconstruction suggests this species was a primitive but intelligent tool maker."
Cut back to Bandit.
Bandit: "Note the derived morphology of the femur, its pronounced robusticity, and rugged muscle attachments: This mosaic of characters is indisputable evidence for bipedal locomotion and evolutionary descent from a quadrupedal antecedent!"
The audience applauds accompanied by whistles. Bandit smirks and adjusts his name tag.
Bandit: "This is a singular find of unprecedented significance for our understanding of the origin of modern dogs; it is a rare relic from our distant past."
The audience applauds and cheers. Bandit nods in approval.
The room falls silent aside for the ventilation machinery. Bandit glances back and forth between the bone and the audience, showing increasing strain. Then he snaps, suddenly gnawing the bone.
Bandit: (growlingly) "Gnam-nam-nam-nam! (inhales) Argn-nam-nam..."
