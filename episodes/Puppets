The episode opens in the dining room. Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo are sitting at the table, eating eggs on toast. Bluey is chewing with her mouth open.
Bandit: Bluey, come on, chew with your mouth shut.
Bluey: Sorry, Dad. I keep forgetting.
Bandit: That's OK.
Bluey immediately goes back to chewing with her mouth open.
Bandit: Bluey!
Bluey: Sorry!
Bandit: Well, if you won't listen to me, maybe you'll listen to...
Bandit reaches under the table, and comes up with the Unicorse puppet.
Bluey, Bingo: Unicorse!
Unicorse: How's it going, salad dodgers?
Bandit: Well, Unicorse, Bluey keeps chewing with her mouth open.
Unicorse glances from Bluey back to Bandit.
Unicorse: So? I chew with my mouth open all the time. Watch.
Unicorse picks something out of his mane and pops it in his mouth.
Unicorse: (chewing) Omf om om.
Bandit, Bluey and Bingo: (gasp)
Bandit: Did you just eat a tick from your own hair?
Unicorse: Yep.
Bandit, Bluey and Bingo: Eugh!
Bandit: You know what, kids, don't listen to Unicorse.
Unicorse: What? Why not?
Bandit: 'Cause you're a grub. 
Bandit counts on his fingers.
Bandit: You don't brush your teeth, you don't eat vegetables and you don't take showers.
Unicorse: (burps)
Bingo and Bluey: (laugh)
Bandit: Grub.
Bluey: But that's why we like him. He doesn't care that he's a grub.
Unicorse: I'm happy with who I am. Why should I change?
Chilli enters.
Chilli: Morning, blue bears!
The camera focuses on Unicorse, and does a dramatic dolly zoom on his face.
Unicorse: (gasp)
The camera cuts to a shot of Chilli walking into the kitchen. The shot is clearly from Unicorse's perspective - the shot is in soft focus, with side lighting, sparkles, and a noticeable pink tint. We cut back to the family at the dining room table.
Unicorse: Who is that?!
Bluey: That's our mum!
Unicorse: Well...
Unicorse licks his hoof, and slicks back his hair and horn.
Unicorse: I'm gonna marry your mum.
Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo: What?!
Unicorse marches down the table. Bingo holds him back.
Bingo: (laughing) Stop! She's already married.
Unicorse: And... why should I care?
Bluey: You would care if you knew who she was married to.
Bandit: Yeah. He's a pretty smooth guy.
Unicorse: Not as smooth as me! Check it.
Cut to the kitchen. Chilli is loading the dishwasher. Unicorse pops up from below the countertop.
Chilli: (startled) Ooh!
Unicorse: (singsong) Hey, toots, when are we getting married?
Cut to a lower view of the kitchen, we can see the kids and Bandit lying on the floor.
Bluey and Bingo: (giggle)
Bandit: Mm, smooth.
Chilli: I'd say... never.
Unicorse: Hey, hey, hey! Check me out first.
Unicorse does a little dance that seems to be intended to show off his bum, if he had one. He has an orange stain on his back.
Chilli: Is that chilli sauce?
Unicorse: It's sweet chilli sauce.
OriginalDisney/CBeebiesUnicorse: "Care for a lick?"Unicorse: "Do ya wanna bit?"
Unicorse sticks his stain in Chilli's face.
Chilli: Tempting, but no. You look like you've never cleaned your teeth, brushed your hair, or had a shower in your life.
Chilli closes the dishwater and walks off.
Unicorse: (sobbing)
Bandit: Well, you gave it a good shot. Now, I think you best be getting
off.
Bandit starts to remove the puppet.
Bluey and Bingo: No, don't stop!
Unicorse: (suddenly determined) I ain't going nowhere until your mum and I are together.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Bandit: Oh, man.
Unicorse: What were all those things she said? Teeth combing and showuzz?
Bluey and Bingo: Showers
Unicorse: Whatever. Show me how to do 'em.
Bluey: OK, come with us.
Unicorse: Alright!
Unicorse pantomimes walking after them, but gets nowhere as Bandit is still lying on the floor.
Bandit: The thing is, I do this to myself.
TITLE CARD - Puppets
Unicorse: I don't know what that says, I can't read!
Cut to the bathroom. Unicorse is holding Bluey's electric toothbrush in both hooves, and Bingo is applying toothpaste for him.
Bingo: This is toothpaste.
Unicorse: Do I eat it?
Bluey and Bingo: (laugh)
Bingo: No! It makes your teeth clean.
Unicorse: What does this button do?
Unicorse pushes the button on the toothbrush, which begins to vibrate, spraying toothpaste everywhere.
Unicorse: Argh! Argh! Argh! Kill it! Kill it!
Bluey and Bingo: (giggle)
Cut to Unicorse in the shower, panicking and running in circles.
Unicorse: Argh! It's freezing! Argh!
Bluey and Bingo: (giggle)
Cut to the kids' bedroom. Bluey is sitting on her bed, brushing Unicorse's hair.
Unicorse: Ow! Ow! Ow! That's it! You get the horn!
Unicorse turns around and tries to stab Bluey with his soft fabric horn.
Bluey: (giggles)
Cut to the dining room. Bluey puts a plate with a broccoli floret in front of Unicorse. Unicorse nibbles on it and spits it out.
Unicorse: (retching) Gah! Yuk!
Bluey and Bingo: (giggle)
Unicorse: (retching) Gah!
Bandit: Maybe self-improvement
just isn't for you.
Bingo starts eating her own broccoli floret.
Bluey: Listen, Unicorse, no-one wants to eat broccoli.
Bingo: Except me.
Bluey: You just have to do it.
Unicorse: But why do I have to?
Bluey sets a photo of Chilli on the table. She is posing in front of the Sidney Opera House. She looks much younger - she has longer hair and almost no gray hairs in her coat. (She also appears possibly preggy.)
Bluey: Because you want to marry Mum and she loves broccoli eaters.
Unicorse: Okay, let's do this.
Unicorse starts munching on the broccoli. Cut to the shower. Bluey is holding the photo. As the water is turned on, Unicorse screws up his face with effort.
Unicorse: (groans with effort).
Cut to the kids bedroom. Bluey is brushing Unicorse's hair; Unicorse is staring at the photo of Chilli.
Unicorse: Ow! (grunts)
Cut to the bathroom. Unicorse has got the toothbrush in his mouth this time, and Bingo is holding up the photo of Chilli for him. Toothpaste sprays everywhere when he turns the toothbrush on.
Unicorse: (grunts)
Cut to the green living room. Chilli is reading a magazine on the couch. Bluey and Bingo are peering at her from the stair railing. Cut to the stairs. Bandit and Unicorse are sitting on the stairs behind the kids. Unicorse's hair and horn are slicked back and shiny; his beard is braided, and he's wearing a little black bow tie.
Bluey: Okay, you're ready. Go and talk to Mum.
Unicorse: Okay. A quick tick for the road.
Unicorse rummages in his hair, but Bluey stops him before he can eat the tick.
Bluey: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You cannot eat a tick in front of Mum.
Bluey pantomimes grabbing the tick and flicking it to the floor.
Bluey: You got that?
Unicorse: Okay. Yep, got it.
Bluey: (pointedly) You got that, Dad?
Bandit: What's it got to do with me?
Unicorse: Yeah! What's it got to do with him?
Back at the couch, Chilli is still reading the magazine. Unicorse pops up from behind the couch.
Unicorse: Hi!
Chilli: (startled) Oh!
Unicorse: Oh, sorry, toot...I mean, love. I didn't mean to scare you.
Chilli: That's okay.
Unicorse: I've just stepped out of the show-ah and brushed my teeth.
Unicorse lunges forward with his mouth open to show Chilli his teeth.
Chilli (startled) Oh!
Unicorse: And I'm wondering, would you like to join me for some brocconi?
Unicorse produces a broccoli floret from somewhere.
Bluey: Broccoli!
Unicorse: Uh, I mean, broccoli.
Chilli puts down the magazine.
Chilli: Well, I must say, you really have cleaned yourself up. And I love your little bow tie. OK, yes, I'd love to.
Unicorse grabs a tick from his mane and eats it.
Unicorse: (munches)
Chilli: Oh, my gosh! (gags)
Chilli retches, and then runs out of the room.
Unicorse: No! Come back.
Chilli: (gags)
Unicorse wilts, laying his head on the couch. Bandit pops up from the floor.
Bandit: Well, that could have gone a bit better.
Bluey: Dad!
Bandit: What?
Unicorse: Oh, I'm sorry, kids. I couldn't help it.
Bingo: It's not your fault, Unicorse.
Bluey: Yeah, it's his.
Bandit: Me?!
Unicorse: Him? I don't understand. I'm the one who ate the tick.
Bluey: Unicorse, you're a puppet. He controls you.
Unicorse: (laughs) Ah, that's a good one.
Bandit: (laughs) Yeah.
Bingo: Dad.
Bluey: You are a puppet. I'll show you. Say something the exact same time as him.
Unicorse: Okay, we'll say "bauxite". You ready?
Bandit: Ready.
Unicorse: Bauxite!
Bandit: Bauxite!
Bluey and Bingo: See? Dad said it after!
Unicorse: Oh, he was just late. Try again.
Unicorse: Bauxite!
Bandit: Bauxite!
Unicorse: (laughs) He's just mucking around. 
Unicorse smooshes Bandit's face.
Unicorse: That's why I love this guy.
Bluey: Dad, tell him the truth.
Bandit: Okay, okay. Look, mate, you are a puppet, and I do control you. I'm sorry.
Unicorse: (laughs) There he goes again.
Bluey: It's true. Have you ever looked at your legs?
Unicorse: What do you mean look at my legs? They're just normal. 
Unicorse pulls up the hem of his torso, revealing Bandit's wrist.
Unicorse: (gasp)
Unicorse follows the wrist up Bandit's arm to his face.
Unicorse: My life is a lie.
Bandit: Yeah, and one more thing.
Bandit holds up a wedding photo of himself and Chilli.
Unicorse: (gasps) Oh!
Unicorse faints. Cut to the front porch. Bandit is reclining in a chair; Unicorse is sprawled over the arm of the recliner. His bow tie has fallen off. Chilli and the girls enter.
Chilli: Hi.
Unicorse: Oh, well, this won't be awkward.
Chilli: What are you doing?
Unicorse: Whatever he wants to do.
Bandit: Someone's feeling a bit sorry for themselves.
Unicorse: Someone? You're a someone! I'm a... no-one.
Chilli: (whispering) You ready?
The girls nod.
Chilli: (whispering) Go!
Bluey pulls the puppet off of Bandit's hand.
Bandit as Unicorse: Hey, hey, hey.
Bluey puts on the puppet.
Bluey as Unicorse: What's going on? Whoa, this feels weird.
Bluey transfers the puppet to Bingo.
Bingo as Unicorse: Whoa! This is amazing!
Chilli: You know what's good about being no-one?
Bingo as Unicorse: What?
Bingo transfers the puppet to Chilli.
Chilli: You're everyone.
Framed against the evening sun, Chilli gives Unicorse a kiss.
Chilli as Unicorse: Whoa!
Cut to the girls' bedroom at night. Bandit as Unicorse is tucking Bluey in.
Unicorse: Oh, crazy day.
Bluey: Shyeah.
Unicorse: I've been thinking. How can you be sure you're not a puppet?
Bluey: (giggles) Don't be silly. Night, Unicorse
Unicorse: Night.
Unicorse walks away. The camera pulls back through the fourth wall to show the scene in a CelAction2D window. Over the next 25 seconds, we see a timelapse of Joe Brumm's hand manipulating Bluey's model to animate the scene that follows. He renders a preview of the scene and presses play, and the camera zooms back in. It's now daytime. Bluey sits up and yawns.
Bluey: Wow, that was a weird dream.
The credits song is an alternate arrangement of the music from the animation dream sequence.
