Brrk, bawk,
bawk, bawk...
We'll have to cook the chickenrat egg
in the morning, Bingo.
This is the second time
I've said bedtime!
What on Earth have you done
to your father?
 Ah-choo!
 This episode of Bluey
is called Chickenrat.
I can't find Floppy anywhere.
Okay.
Keep calm.
Let's retrace your steps.
When did you last have him?
I don't know.
Okay.
What did you do
before you got ready for bed?
I don't know!
Um, we were on the balcony.
We were making a fire
to cook the chickenrat egg.
Psheww! Fire!
Dad's gonna love this egg.
Ooh!
That reminds me.
We better turn him back into a dog.
 Okay, kids, bedtime!
Oh, Mum!
Then we came in here.
Righto.
Let's check the balcony.
No sign of Floppy.
Ohhh!
What did you do
before you made the campfire?
Um, we took Chickenrat
into the bathroom...
...to lay an egg.
-Come on, Chickenrat.
-
Time to lay your egg!
Bawk, bawk,
bawk, bawk!
♪ Lay an egg, lay an egg ♪
♪ Lay a chickenrat egg ♪
♪ For our breakfast,

Brrk, brrk, brrk, brrk!
Baaaaaawk!
Boop!
-
-Brrk!
Let's go and cook it
on the balcony!
Okay.
Bawk, bawk,
bawk, bawk.
Then we came here.
Okay. Let's check
the bathroom.
I was wondering why my clean towels
were all over the floor.
Floppy's not here.
Where were you before you brought
Chickenrat into the bathroom?
Hmm. Hallway.
Yeah, Dad was hiding.
Aha!
Ah, that sauerkraut!
Chickenrat!
Pchew!
Bawk!
Brrk, brrk, brrk,
brrk, brrk...
-It worked!
-Yes!
Now we just need him
to lay an egg.
Hmm.
We need a nest.
How about the laundry basket?
Yeah!
Come on, Chickenrat.
Come on.
Brrk, brrk, brrk...
Floppy's not here.
Before we turned Dad
into a chickenrat,
we were at...
the couch!
Chickenrat!
Peww!
-Yah! You won't get me!
-
-
-He went up the stairs!
Hmm. Not here.
Where were you before the living room?
Hmmm.
We were at the dress-up box,
dressing up as ninjas.
No Floppy here.
Where were we before
we dressed up as ninjas?
In the backyard!
Getting the magic wand!
We used this magic wand
to turn Dad into a chickenrat!
And then he can lay
a chickenrat egg for us.
Yeah!
We're going to need
to sneak up on him, though.
Let's dress up as ninjas!
Yeah!
Hmm. No Floppy.
Where were we
before we were out here?
The fridge!
Checking to see if we had
any chickenrat eggs.
Hmm. We've got
normal chicken eggs.
But no chickenrat eggs.
Where do chickenrat eggs
even come from?
Mummy chickenrats,
I suppose.
So we just need
a Mummy chickenrat.
I've got an idea!
Let's get my magic wand
from the backyard.
Hmm.
No Floppy here.
Before the kitchen?
The shop!
Hello, Chef.
The customer has ordered
one chickenrat egg.
What's a chickenrat?
It's half chicken
and half rat.
We don't even have
one chickenrat egg.
Oh! Let's check
the fridge!
No Floppy here.
Okay, before we were here,
I was back
at the couch...
taking Dad's order.
Good morning, customer.
What can I get you
for breakfast?
Oh. Um...
I'll have an egg, please.
Certainly.
That won't take long.
Ah, hang on.
Not a normal egg.
I want a chickenrat egg.
What's a chickenrat?
It's a cross
between a chicken and a rat.
Hmm. Okay.
I'll just check with the chef.
Take your time.
Ohh!
I'm sorry, Bingo.
We've already searched here,
and it's getting late.
We'll have to look for Floppy
in the morning.
Ohh! Floppy's
gone forever.
It's okay, Bingo.
She's probably
just hiding somewhere.
Hiding?
Ah! I know where Floppy is!
I know where Floppy is!
Where?
 Floppy!
What was she doing
in the chickenrat egg?
Well...
we were having lunch...
I'm so hungry!
I could eat everyone at this table!
Quick, Floppy!
You need to hide from Daddy
before he eats you!
You'll be safe in here.
Oh, maybe I'll just
have some sauerkraut instead.
But mum says you can't eat sauerkraut
Yeah, it makes you burp.
I know, but it's so good!
Dad, can you be our customer
for Restaurant?
Not until I've laid on the couch
and read every section
of the newspaper.
Dad would love to be
your customer, kids.
Come on, Bingo.
You and me can play.
Yeah!
Well, that was an adventure.
Night, Mum.
Night, Mum.
Night, Bluey.
Night, Bingo.
Night, Floppy.
Night, Chickenrat.
Bawk, bawk, .
Sorry, I've got a problem
