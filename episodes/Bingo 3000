The episode opens in the living room, early in the morning. Bandit walks in, carrying a limp Bingo slung over his shoulder.
Bandit: "Hup!"
He lifts Bingo from his shoulder and flops her onto the couch. Bingo giggles. She folds her legs up against her chest. Bandit sits down next to her and rubs his hands together eagerly.
Bandit: "All right! A brand-new Bingo 3000, can't wait to check it out! Just pop these down..."
Bandit straightens Bingo’s legs to lie flat on the couch.
Bingo: "Boop."
Bingo's legs pop back up into the folded position.
Bandit: "Hey, what?"
Bandit pulls her legs back down flat.
Bingo: "Boop."
Bingo's legs pop back up. Bandit scratches his head.
Bandit: "Well, that's not right."
He lowers Bingo's legs again.
Bandit: "There we go—"
Bingo's legs pop back up.
Bingo: "Boop."
Bandit: "Hey!"
Bandit puts his hand on his face.
Bandit: "Oh, man...this thing's busted.
He grabs Bingo and rolls her from side to side as she giggles.
Bandit: "Must be a number on here somewhere..."
He lifts up her bum.
Bandit: "Ah, here we go."
He pantomimes pulling out a phone and dialing a phone number.
Bandit: "Three three three, four four four, five three three."
He pretends to put the phone to his ear.
Bandit: (scornfully) "Typical."
He lets Bingo drop back to the couch. She laughs.
Bandit: (over-enunciating) "Technical. Support."
He glances and Bingo, then pushes her legs down again.
Bingo: "Boop.
Her legs pop back up.
Bandit: "Uh, yeah, hello? Yes, I'm fine. Yeah. Look, I just bought a Bingo 3000, and I'm having some problems with the bottom, kind of, legs bit?"
He pushes Bingos legs down again.
Bandit: "Yeah, you straighten them out..."
Bingo: "Boop."
Her legs pop back up.
Bandit: "...and they just go back up. Yeah, I tried that. Doesn't work.
He brightens up.
Bandit: "Oh, okay, yeah. I'll try that."
He grabs Bingo's nose. She giggles.
Bandit: "So grab this bit, yep. Now what? Just jiggle it? Okay."
He wiggles Bingo's nose back and forth. She wriggles and squeals.
Bandit: "Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle!"
He lets go.
Bandit: "Okay, I jiggled it."
He pretends to hold the phone against his ear with his shoulder, and pushes Bingo's legs down with both hands.
Bandit: "Just try this again."
Bingo: "Boop."
Her legs pop back up.
Bandit: "Nah, didn't work mate.
He goes back to holding the phone normally.
Bandit: "What else you got? Yeah, okay, I'm looking underneath.
He rolls Bingo over.
Bandit: "Just... poke around? Okay, can do."
He pokes at Bingo's back. She laughs and squeals. Bandit rolls her back over, then puts her legs down. For a moment, they stay down.
Bingo: "Boop."
Her legs pop back up.
Bandit: "Nah, mate. Didn't work. Still busted. Now what? Poke the front bit? Okay."
Bandit unenthusiastically pokes Bingo's chest. She squeals and laughs. He pulls her legs down again.
Bingo: "Boop."
Her legs pop back up.
Bandit: "Nah."
Bandit stands up.
Bandit: "Look, mate, I want my money back."
He pauses as the other party speaks.
Bandit: "What?! Mate, I'm not drivin' all the way back in to you guys, alright? I've got finals footy this arv. You guys come pick it up. I dunno, send a taxi. Whadda you mean you're not gonna do that? Ah, forget you!"
Bandit throws the pretend phone out of the room.
Bandit: "That's it!"
Bandit picks up Bingo, upside down, and shakes her around and side to side while growling. Bingo squeals and laughs.
Bandit, still holding her up, pulls out her legs.
Bandit: "It worked! It worked!"
Bingo: "Boop."
Her legs pop back up.
Bandit: "Aaaagh!"
Bandit tosses Bingo onto the couch and runs out of the room. Bingo laughs.
Cut to the sunroom. Bandit and Chilli sit on the sofa, reading a newspaper and magazine respectively. Chilli closes her magazine and puts it on the floor.
Chilli: "Bingo 3000? Magazine."
Bingo waddles slowly into the room, her legs still bent.
Bingo: "Boop! Boop! Boop!"
She continues booping as she slowly approaches the sofa.
Chilli: "Hm. I thought this thing would be faster."
Bandit: "Don't get me started."
