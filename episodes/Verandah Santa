Bandit: Bluey!
Bluey: SHE BIT ME!!!
Socks whines and runs off.
Bingo: Whee!
Bandit: Bluey, I think you should say sorry to Socks.
Bluey: I didn't do anything wrong! I was teaching her that Santa doesn't give you presents if you're not nice.
Bandit: Bluey, don't worry about whether Santa's gonna bring you presents or not, OK?
Bluey: Why?
Chilli: 'Cause it's not the reason to be nice to people.
Bluey: Well, then, what's the reason?
Chilli: Come with us.
They go outside and see Socks sitting next to the lit up reindeer, who sniffs.
Bluey: Oh.
Chilli: That's the reason.
Bandit: Imagine if Socks did to you what you did to her.
Bluey walks over to Socks.
Bluey: Hi, Socks. I'm sorry I didn't give you any presents. I was mad at you 'cause you bit me and you didn't say sorry.
Socks walks over to Bluey and licks where she bit Bluey's arm. Bluey hugs Socks, who accepts the hug. Later, everyone is playing Verandah Santa with Bandit playing Verandah Santa.
Bandit: OK. Night, kids. That's enough sinister plotting.
All: Night-night.
Bandit: Ho, ho... Whoa, no!
All: Get him!
Bandit gets hit by several pillows.
Bandit: Verandah Santa's just trying to do his job. You naughty kids!
