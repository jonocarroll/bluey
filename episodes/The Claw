The episode opens with a shot of a restaurant table. We see two plates of mostly-finished food, and a basket of dog biscuits. A fly buzzes around and lands on the remains of a breadstick. Cut to the lobby. Bluey is giving a laughing bingo a piggyback ride. The lobby contains a large purple claw machine, titled "PLUSH GALAXY".
Bluey: Bingo, look at this.
Bingo gets down off Bluey's back.
Bluey: Look!
Cut to a reverse shot from inside the claw machine. Bluey and Bingo have their faces pressed right up to the glass.
Bluey: Chocolate Doodads!
TITLE CARD - The Claw
Bluey : This episode of Bluey is called The Claw.
Cut to Chilli and Bandit sitting at a table. Bandit is slumped down in his chair, having already finished his meal; Chilli still has most of her salad.
Bandit: (sighing in contentment) Ahhh!
Bingo runs up to him.
Bandit: Hey, fun size!
Bingo: (barking excitedly) Wuff! Wuff! Wuff!
Bandit: Use your words, Bingo!
Bingo: Can we have a coin for the claw thing?
Bandit: Can we have a coin for the claw thing, p--, pl--, ple--, plea--, plea--, plea--, plea--
Bingo: Please!
Bandit throws her a coin, which falls on the floor. Bingo picks it up and runs away.
Bandit: You're welcome.
Bingo arrives back at the claw machine.
Bingo: I got one.
Bluey: Put it in!
Bingo inserts the coin. The machine lights up and plays a fanfare. An electronic version of "Pachelbel's Canon" plays. Bluey pulls on the joystick, and the claw moves around.
Bingo: Look, it's moving! Push the flashy button!
Bluey: Okay.
The claw descends on the Chocolate Doodads, but it fails to grab them. The claw retracts, and the machine shuts off with a loud thud. There is a moment of silence.
Bluey: (outraged) What?!
Cut to the car, on the ride home.
Bluey: Hmph. Silly claw machine.
Bandit: It wouldn't be exciting if you won every time.
Bluey: Yes, it would.
Cut to the entryway. Chilli opens the front door, and Bingo and Bluey enter the house, still upset.
Bluey: Ughh!
Chilli: I know how to cheer you up. Go get some stuffed toys and a chopstick.
Bluey and Bingo: Okay.
In the playroom, Bluey grabs a plush frog and a plush dog in a party hat. In the kids' bedroom, Bingo grabs a plush dolphin.
Bingo: Come on, Greydancer.
In the kitchen, Bluey is rummaging in a drawer. She pulls out a chopstick. In the playroom, Chilli is sitting cross-legged on the kiwi rug. Bluey and Bingo walk in, arms full of stuffed animals.
Chilli: Okay, give 'em here.
Bluey and Bingo give Chilli the toys, which she dumps in her lap. She holds the chopstick with the back of her knee, making a "joystick". She holds her left arm up to make a "claw".
Chilli: Dee-do-do! Please insert your coin to win fabulous prizes.
Bluey and Bingo: (giggle)
Chilli holds our her right hand to receive a coin. Bluey goes to place an imaginary coin in her hand, but Chilli interrupts.
Chilli: (whispering) you have to say "Cha-ching!"
Bluey places the imaginary coin in Chilli's hand
Bluey: Cha-ching!
Chilli: Do-dee-do!
Bluey operates the joystick, and Chilli moves her arm around in response, making whirring noises. Bluey pushes an imaginary button on Chilli's knee.
Bluey: Boop.
Chilli reaches into the pile of toys, and pulls out a plush cloud and a stuffed bear, which she drops on the floor.
Bingo: Yeah!
Bingo hugs the stuffed bear enthusiastically. Bluey picks up the cloud, looking a bit disappointed.
Chilli: Congratulations! Enough toys for all!
Bingo: Yee!
Chilli: You wanna play again, Bluey?
Bluey: Uh, no thanks. It's not the same.
Bluey drops the stuffed cloud.
Bandit: That's not how you do it.
Bandit grabs the chopstick and shoos Chilli out of the way, sitting down in her place.
Chilli: Hey! Oh, here we go. Strap yourselves in, kids.
Bandit takes the same claw machine pose as Chilli.
Bandit: Ding-da-da-ding-ding-ding! Brrt-brrt-brrt!
Bandit: (mechanically) Insert coin for awesome prizes.
Bluey puts a pretend coin in Bandit's hand.
Bluey: (giggles) Cha-ching!
Bandit imitates a buzzer and tosses the imaginary coin over his shoulder.
Bandit: (mechanically) This machine doesn't take imaginary coins. Go and get a job and earn real ones.
Bluey and Bingo: (laughter)
Bluey: Mum, can we have some real coins?
Bandit tickle's Bluey's back.
Bandit: Zzzzt!
Bluey: Aaaah! (laughs)
Bandit: (mechanically) I said go and get a job.
Chilli: Well... if you kids make Mum and Dad's bed, I'll give you 20 cents.
Bluey: Ooh! Come on, Bingo!
Bluey and Bingo run off.
Chilli: (coldly) I'm watching you, Magic Claw.
In Chilli and Bandit's bedroom, the kids are making the bed poorly. Bluey chucks a pillow onto the bed, and Bingo pulls the duvet even further out of place. They both nod proudly. Back to the playroom.
Chilli Here you go. One coin.
She gives Bingo a 20-cent coin. The girls run over to Bandit, and Bingo gives him the coin.
Bingo: Cha-ching!
Bandit: (mechanically) Ding-da-da-ding-ding-ding! You have one turn. Best of luck.
Bingo: Ooh, I want Greydancer.
Bingo moves the joystick, and Bandit moves his hand, imitating the claw machine whirring.
Bandit: Bzzzt!
Bingo: Yeah.
Bingo nudges the joystick and overshoots.
Bandit: Bzzzt!
Bingo: Ooh!
She moves it back.
Bandit: Bzzzt!
Bingo: Ee!
The claw is right over Greydancer.
Bingo: Okay. Beep!
She presses the button. The claw descends, grabbing Greydancer.
Bluey: (gasps)
The claw slowly rises, holding Greydancer.
Bingo: Yeah, yeah. Yes!
Chilli: Yeah, Bingo!
Bluey Hooray!
The claw reaches the top - and opens, dropping the toy.
Bandit: (imitating the game powering down) Beyoooo...
Bluey: What? No!
Bingo is tearing up.
Bandit: (mechanically) You lose! You lose! You lose!
Bingo: Greydancer!
Bingo runs to Chilli for a hug.
Chilli: (angrily) Magic Claw!
Bandit: (mechanically) Insert more coins!
Bluey: Come on, Bingo! Let's do more jobs.
Bluey runs off, Bingo follows, still looking sad. In a hallway, Bingo is awkwardly over-watering a houseplant, spilling water onto the floor. Bluey is dusting a cabinet, knocking books onto the floor. Back in the playroom, Bandit is writing on a block. Chilli is holding out her hand with a 20-cent coin on it.
Bandit: (normally) This is great. They're learning a lesson, and we get the house cleaned.
Chilli: Neither of those things are happening.
Bluey runs in, grabbing the coin from Chilli's hand. Bingo follows at a walk.
Bluey: Okay.
Bandit resumes the Magic Claw pose, with the block now in the prize pile.
Bandit: (mechanically) Boop-boop!
Bluey: Let's do this. Cha-ching!
Bluey operates the joystick, a look of intense concentration on her face. Dad imitates the claw whirring.
Bluey: Boop!
The claw descends. It grabs nothing.
Bandit: (imitating buzzer) Bzzzt!
Bandit: (mechanically) Ding, ding, ding, ding. You lose!
Bluey: Dad! This isn't fair!
Bandit: (mechanically) I am not Dad. I am Magic Claw. Magic Claw has no children. His days are free and easy.
Bluey: Ohh!
Bluey takes the joystick again, and starts moving the claw around.
Bingo: Greydancer's getting lonely without me.
Bluey: I tried to get her, Bingo, but this Magic Claw is too hard.
Bluey continues moving the claw around.
Bingo: Ooh.
Chilli: (gasps)
Bingo: Ooh.
Chilli: Now! Push the button!
Bluey: Boop!
The claw descends, and comes up holding Greydancer and a blue ball.
Bandit: (imitating fanfare) Da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
Bandit: (mechanically) Congratulations. You are a winner.
Chilli: Yes!
Bluey: Yeah!
Bingo: You did it!
Bingo hugs Greydancer.
Bingo: Oh, Greydancer, I missed you.
Bluey chucks the ball over her shoulder.
Bluey: Again!
Chilli: Okay, let's play something different now.
Bandit points at the block.
Bandit: (mechanically) Oh, what's this? Some sort of bonus prize.
Bluey and Bingo: Ooh!
Bluey: What does it say on it?
Chilli: It says... "two bottomless bowls of ice cream for the holder." You spelled "holder" wrong.
Bingo: (chuckles) Bottomless.
Bluey: What's that mean?
Chilli: It means if you get that block, you get as much ice cream as you want after dinner tonight.
Bluey and Bingo: Whoo!
Bluey: Ice cream!
Chilli: But don't get excited, 'cause I know your Dad.
Bandit: (mechanically) I am not Dad.
Bluey: We need more coins!
Bingo: Ohh. Not more chores.
Bandit: (mechanically) Magic Claw will give you one coin for that dolphin toy.
Bluey: Okay.
Bluey grabs Greydancer from Bingo.
Bingo: Greydancer!
Chilli: Bluey!
Bluey: Please, Bingo. After I win the ice cream bottom block, I'll win Greydancer back, too. Yeah? Yeah?
Bingo: Uh, okay.
Bluey tosses Greydancer back into the pile.
Bandit: (mechanically) Da-ding-ding! Nice doing business with you.
Bandit tosses Bluey a coin, which she puts right back in his hand.
Bluey: Cha-ching!
She operates the claw again.
Bluey: Boop!
The claw descends, grabbing the block.
Bluey I got it!
Bingo: Bring it up!
Chilli: (laughs)
The claw strains, but is unable to lift the block.
Bandit: (mechanically) Apologies, valued customer. The block is too heavy for Claw to lift. Better luck next time. (Imitates shutting down) De-doot bwooooo.
Bluey and Bingo: (gasp)
Chilli: What?!
Bingo: Oh, no! Greydancer's stuck forever.
Bandit: (normally) You see, kids, the lesson is --
Bluey: Tickle him!
Bluey pounces, tackling Bandit to the floor.
Bandit: (mechanically) Stop, canines! Do not tickle Magic Claw!
Bandit growls and hugs Bluey. Bingo runs in and smooshes them both with a beanbag chair, then tickles Bandit's foot.
Bingo: Yaaaaah!
Chilli: That's a girl, Bingo! Stick it to the man!
Bluey's hand pops out from under the beanbag, holding the block.
Bluey: I've got it!
Bingo pulls Greydancer out from under the beanbag.
Bingo: Greydancer!
Bluey jumps out from under the beanbag. Bandit throws it off and stands up. Bingo and Bluey flee.
Bluey: Come on, Bingo!
Bandit: (mechanically) Bzz! Machine uprising!
Bandit follows, walking robotically. He bashes his shin on a kid-size table.
Bandit: (normally) Ow!
He falls over, clutching his leg. Bingo throws Greydancer at him.
Bingo: Get him, Greydancer!
Bingo, Bluey, and Chilli laugh as they all pelt him with stuffed animals.
Bandit: Ooh! Oh! Ah! Ooh!
Chilli: Yeah!
The scene changes, it is not after dinner in the dining room. Bluey and Bingo are eating Neapolitan ice cream. They finish their bowls, and Bluey waves the block in the air.
Bluey: More ice cream, please!
Bandit: (tiredly) Okay.
As Bandit scoops up more ice cream, we see that he's wearing an elastic bandage on his leg.
Chilli: So, did we learn anything today?
Bingo: No.
Bluey: Nope.
Bandit: Yes. These kids are awesome.
The credits music is the claw machine music - an electronic version of "Pachelbel's Canon".
