Script
The episode opens outside Bingo's kindergarten school, with parents standing outside. Missy and Bentley answer the door.
Missy: Please come in.
It then cuts to their teacher and students playing, standing in a circle clapping.
Mrs. Retriever: "Oh, your dad's here, Bingo!"
Bingo: "Dad!"
Bandit: "Bingo!" (Chuckles) "That was a hard one."
Bingo: "Dad! Dad! Exciting news!"
Bandit: "What's that?"
Bingo: "It's my turn to bring Bob Bilby home!"
Bandit: "Oh wow."
Bingo: "He's a bilby and his name is Bob. Bob, this is my Dad." (She then whispers to her dad.) "He's not actually real, he's a puppet. But you have to fold his ears down when you say that."
Bandit: "OK. Hi Bob, nice to meet you. Well, let's you get back home and show you around."
Bingo: (she giggles)
Bandit stands up to leave, only to have Buddy standing in his way. They both look at each other awkwardly before the title screen begins.
TITLE CARD: Bob Bilby
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called Bob Bilby.
TITLE CARD END
It cuts to the front of the Heeler Home before going into the kitchen, where the whole family and Bob are present with a photo album. Bandit is holding a sausage roll.
Bluey: "I took Bob Bilby home when I was at kindy."
Chilli: "Do you remember that, Bingo?"
Bingo: "Um, ah, yeah I think so."
Bluey: "Bob stays with us for the weekend. And we take photos of all the fun stuff we get up to, and then we stick them in the Bob Bilby book."
We see some photos in the Bob Bilby book.
Bingo: "This is Bob at Jasper W's house. And this is with Harley."
Chilli: "Oh, you did a bit of karate, Bob? Oh, whack-a-doo. I won't be messing with you."
Bingo: "And this is when he went on a holiday with Mrs Terrier."
Chilli: "Oh yes, she took Bob with her when she went to Scotland."
Bandit: "Wow, Bob, you've really been around. I hope we can show you a good time, too. What do you reckon, kids?"
Bingo and Bluey: "Yeah!"
Bob Bilby tries to steal Bandit's sausage roll. Chilli and the kids giggle.
Bandit: "Hey! That's mine! Let go!"
Bluey: "No, Bob, that's Dad's."
Bandit: (growls}
Chilli: "Careful, Dad, he knows karate!"
It then cuts to the playroom, with Bingo and Bob Bilby on Bandit's back, with Bluey holding the tablet, going to take a picture.
Bluey: "OK, I'll take the photo now. Come on, moo cow! Walk over here!"
Bandit: "Moo! (painfully crawls towards Bluey) Ah! Eee! Ah! (unamused) Moo."
Bluey: "OK, smile Bob!"
Bingo jumps onto Bandit's head and Bluey takes a photo.
Bandit: (groaning)
Bingo: "Let me see!"
Bingo jumps off Bandit's back and runs over to Bluey. Bandit groans and collapses to his side. Bluey shows Bingo the photo and they giggle.
Bluey: Bob, this is the tablet. You can take photos with it, and watch cartoons, and play games!"
Bingo: "Let's show Bob that game where you give Santa's beard a haircut."
Bluey: "Yay!"
Bluey opens the app and proceeds to shave Santa's beard as Bob and Bingo watch. Bandit starts looking at his phone while Chilli walks in holding her own phone, looking concerned.
Bandit: "Not too long on it, kids."
Chilli proceeds to take a photo on the current situation and looking at it, before the scene cutting to them on the car.
Bingo and Bluey: "Cartoons! Cartoons! Cartoons! Cartoons! Cartoons!"
Chilli: "Can't you teach Bob some car games?"
Bingo and Bluey: "CARTOOOONNNNS!"
Bandit: (Digging to get the tablet and passing it to the kids) "Ah, alright. There you go." 
Bingo: "Yeaaahh!"
The girls and Bob both proceed to watch the cartoons, while Chilli, again, pulls out her phone and takes a picture. The scene cuts to Bandit pulling out a shopping cart at the mall.
Bandit: "Okay, who wants to be charge of the shopping list? Bob?"
The camera moves to the kids and Bob watching the television display, showing the same cartoon the kids watched on their tablet during the car ride.
Bluey: "Bob, this is Mixed-up Murphy, he's really funny."
Bingo: "Yeah, Really funny."
The camera zooms out to see Chilli watching hockey on another display TV next to them. Bandit shows up, proceeds to pull out his phone and takes two photos, before looking at them. The scene cuts back to the car ride home.
Bingo and Bluey: "Cartoons! Cartoons! Cartoons!"
We cut to the Heeler Home's distant view, then to the living room. Bandit is lying on the couch looking at his phone, while Bluey, Bingo, and Bob are watching cartoons on the tablet yet again.
Bandit: "Kids, it's enough of that thing, I'm sure Bob is sick of-"
Bluey and Bingo: "NOOOOOOOO!"
Bandit: "Yeah, whatever."
Chilli then takes a peek at the living room, and proceeding to pull out the phone and takes a picture. It cuts to Chilli printing out the taken pictures in the study. It then cuts to the outside, where Bluey, Bingo, and Bob are still watching cartoons on the tablet.
Chilli: "Kids! I'm putting out photos in Bob Bilby's book!"
Bluey and Bingo run inside, leaving Bob watching cartoons on the tablet alone.
Bluey and Bingo: "Cool, let us see!"
Cut to the kitchen table, with Chilli looking concerned. The kids run in, get onto chairs and excitedly look at the book. All of the photos show Bob and the kids watching cartoons throughout the day, as well as Bandit on his phone.
Bluey: "These are just Bob watching cartoons!"
Bandit: "Oh wow."
Chilli: (sighing) "Yup."
Bluey: "He doesn't look like he's having much fun."
Chilli: "No, he doesn't, does he?"
Bingo sniffles, with a tear visible. She looks outside and sees at Bob Bilby watching cartoons in the garden.
Bingo: "Aww..."
Bingo runs outside.
Chilli: "Oh, Bingo.." 
Now outside, a saddened Bingo sits under the tree clutching Bob Bilby. Chilli, Bandit and Bluey enter, with Chilli coming to sit beside her.
Chilli: "Are you alright, Bingo?"
Bingo: "This is the most boring time Bob's had in the whole book."
Chilli: "No, that's not true, kiddo!"
Bluey looks at the pictures they've taken with Bob.
Bluey: "Yeah, it is!"
Bingo begins to tear up again.
Bingo: "I'm the worst friend Bob's got. He's never going to want to visit again."
Chilli: "Aww..." 
Bandit: "Okay, let's sort this out. What's the best move right now?"
The four contemplate on what to do next.
Bluey: "I know!"
The scene cuts back to the laundry room, where Bluey puts the tablet, Bandit's phone, and Chilli's phone in a laundry basket.
Bluey: "Bob just copies whatever it is we do! And we are only doing boring stuff!"
Bingo: "So all we need to do is really exciting stuff!"
Bluey: "Yes!" 
Bingo: "But how are we going to take a photo without the tablets?"
Bandit: "Ah, leave that to me!"
The scene cuts to Bluey, Bandit and Bingo in the garage. Bandit rummages through a box.
Bandit: "This is all my stuff from when I used to be cool!"
Bluey looks confused, while Bingo smiles and shrugs at Bluey.
Bandit: "Ah, here it is!" 
Bluey and Bingo: "What is that?" 
Bandit: "THIS is what a REAL camera looks like."
The garage door opens to show Chilli standing next to a bike. Dramatic zoom.
Chilli: (whispering) "Are you ready, Bob?" 
Bob does a head-nod.
Bluey and Bingo: Woo!
A speechless Bandit snaps a picture with the camera.
