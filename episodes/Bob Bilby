The episode opens outside Bingo's kindergarten school, with Bandit and some other parents standing outside. Missy and Bentley answer the door.
Missy: Please come in.
We then cut to their teacher, Mrs. Retriever and students playing a game that involves sitting in a circle while clapping.
Mrs. Retriever: "Oh, your dad's here, Bingo!"
Bingo stands up and runs off towards Bandit, holding a puppet in her right hand.
Bingo: "Dad!"
Bandit: "Bingo!" 
Bingo gives Bandit a big hug.
Bandit: (chuckles) "That was a hard one."
Bingo: "Dad! Dad! Exciting news!"
Bandit: "What's that?"
Bingo presents the puppet to Bandit, a purple bilby.
Bingo: "It's my turn to bring Bob Bilby home!"
Bandit: "Oh wow."
Bingo: "He's a bilby and his name is Bob. Bob, this is my Dad."
Bingo folds the puppet's ears down and whispers to her dad.
Bingo: "He's not actually real, he's a puppet. But you have to fold his ears down when you say that."
Bandit shakes the puppet's hand.
Bandit: "OK. Hi Bob, nice to meet you. Well, let's you get back home and show you around."
Bingo: (she giggles)
Bandit stands up to leave, only to have Buddy standing in his way. They both look at each other awkwardly before the title card begins.
The episode's title card is then shown: Bob Bilby. The eponymous puppet is shown above the title card.
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called Bob Bilby.
We cut to the front of the Heeler Home before going into the kitchen, where the whole family and Bob are present with a photo album. Bandit is holding a sausage roll.
Bluey: "I took Bob Bilby home when I was at kindy."
Chilli: "Do you remember that, Bingo?"
Bingo: "Um, ah, yeah I think so."
Bluey: "Bob stays with us for the weekend. And we take photos of all the fun stuff we get up to, and then we stick them in the Bob Bilby book."
We see a photo of Jasper W. in front of his home, holding Bob Bilby.
Bingo: "This is Bob at Jasper W's house. 
We then see a photo of Harley, dressed in a robe while holding Bob Bilby.
Bingo: And this is with Harley."
Chilli: "Oh, you did a bit of karate, Bob?
Bob does some karate.
Chilli: Oh, whack-a-doo. I won't be messing with you."
We see a photo of Bob posing in front of a castle in the background.
Bingo: "And this is when he went on a holiday with Mrs. Terrier."
We see another photo of Bob posing in front of a Scottish busker, playing the bagpipes.
Chilli: "Oh yes, she took Bob with her when she went to Scotland."
Bandit: "Wow, Bob, you've really been around. I hope we can show you a good time, too. What do you reckon, kids?"
Bingo and Bluey: "Yeah!"
Bob Bilby tries to steal Bandit's sausage roll. Chilli and the kids giggle.
Bandit: "Hey! That's mine! Let go!"
Bluey: "No, Bob, that's Dad's."
Bandit: (growls}
Chilli: "Careful, Dad, he knows karate!"
We then cut to the playroom, with Bingo and Bob Bilby on Bandit's back. Bluey is holding the tablet, ready to take a picture.
Bluey: "OK, I'll take the photo now. Come on, moo cow! Walk over here!"
Bandit: "Moo!"
Bandit slowly and painfully crawls towards Bluey.
Bandit: Ah! Eee! Ah! (unamused) Moo."
Bluey: "OK, smile Bob!"
Bingo jumps onto Bandit's head as Bluey takes a photo. Bandit groans in pain from having Bingo on top of his head.
Bingo: "Let me see!"
Bingo jumps off Bandit's back and runs over to Bluey. Bandit groans and collapses to his side. Bluey shows Bingo the photo and they giggle.
Bluey: Bob, this is the tablet. You can take photos with it...
Bluey demonstrates taking a photo.
Bluey: "...and watch cartoons..."
Bluey slides the tablet to a video of a yellow dog in front of a house.
Bluey: "...and play games!"
Bluey presses the home button on the tablet.
Bingo: "Let's show Bob that game where you give Santa's beard a haircut."
Bluey: "Yay!"
Bluey opens the app and proceeds to shave Santa's beard as Bob and Bingo watch. Bandit starts looking at his phone while Chilli walks in holding her own phone, looking concerned.
Bandit: "Not too long on it, kids."
Chilli proceeds to take a photo on the current situation and looking at it. The scene cutting to the Heeler family in the car, where the kids are chanting and demanding to watch cartoons.
Bingo and Bluey: "Cartoons! Cartoons! Cartoons! Cartoons! Cartoons!"
Chilli: "Can't you teach Bob some car games?"
Bluey and Bingo look at each other.
Bluey and Bingo: "CARTOOOONNNNS!"
Bandit digs around to get the tablet, passing it to the kids to finally shut them up.
Bandit: "Ah, alright. There you go." 
Bingo: "Yeaaahh!"
The girls and Bob both proceed to watch their cartoons, while Chilli, again, pulls out her phone to take a picture. The scene cuts to Bandit pulling out a shopping cart at the mall.
Bandit: "Okay, who wants to be charge of the shopping list? Bob?"
The camera moves to the kids and Bob watching the television display, showing the same cartoon the kids watched on their tablet during the car ride. Mackenzie's Dad, Pat and Chloe's Mum (with her newborn baby in a stroller) can be seen walking past. In the background, a strangely red-coloured Stripe and Trixie can be seen looking into a store, talking about something.
Bluey: "Bob, this is Mixed-up Murphy, he's really funny."
Bingo: "Yeah, Really funny."
The camera zooms out to see Chilli watching hockey on another display TV next to them. Bandit shows up, proceeds to pull out his phone and takes two photos, before looking at them. The scene cuts back to the car ride home, with the pups one again chanting for their cartoons.
Bingo and Bluey: "Cartoons! Cartoons! Cartoons!"
We cut to the Heeler Home's distant view, then to the living room. Bandit is lying on the couch looking at his phone, while Bluey, Bingo, and Bob are watching cartoons on the tablet yet again.
Bandit: "Kids, it's enough of that thing, I'm sure Bob is sick of-"
Bluey and Bingo: "NOOOOOOOO!"
Bandit: "Yeah, whatever."
Chilli then takes a peek at the living room, proceeding to pull out the phone and takes a picture. We cut to Chilli printing out the taken pictures in the study. We then cut to the outside, where Bluey, Bingo, and Bob are still watching cartoons on the tablet.
Chilli: "Kids! I'm putting out photos in Bob Bilby's book!"
Bluey and Bingo run inside, leaving Bob to watch cartoons on the tablet alone.
Bluey and Bingo: "Cool, let us see!"
We cut to the kitchen table, where Chilli looks at the scrapbook, concerned. The kids run in, get onto chairs and excitedly look at the book. Every single photo shows Bob and the kids watching cartoons throughout the day, not doing anything else. In the background, Bandit can be seen on his phone.
Bluey: "These are just Bob watching cartoons!"
Bandit: "Oh wow."
Chilli: (sighing) "Yup."
Bingo moves the scrapbook closer.
Bluey: "He doesn't look like he's having much fun."
Chilli: "No, he doesn't, does he?"
Coming to the realisation that she has wasted Bob Bilby's weekend by just watching cartoons, Bingo starts to tear up. She looks outside and sees Bob Bilby watching cartoons in the garden. Bingo cries softly and runs off to go console Bob.
Chilli: "Oh, Bingo.." 
Now outside, a saddened Bingo sits under the tree holding Bob Bilby close. Chilli, Bandit and Bluey enter, with Chilli coming to sit beside her.
Chilli: "Are you alright, Bingo?"
Bingo: "This is the most boring time Bob's had in the whole book."
Chilli: "No, that's not true, kiddo!"
Bluey looks at the pictures they've taken with Bob.
Bluey: "Yeah, it is!"
Bingo begins to tear up again.
Bingo: "I'm the worst friend Bob's got. He's never going to want to visit again."
Chilli: "Aww..." 
Bandit: "Okay, let's sort this out. What's the best move right now?"
The four contemplate on what to do next.
Bluey: "I know!"
We then cut to the laundry room, where Bluey puts the tablet, Bandit's phone, and Chilli's phone in a laundry basket.
Bluey: "Bob just copies whatever it is we do! And we are only doing boring stuff!"
Bingo: "So all we need to do is really exciting stuff!"
Bluey: "Yes!" 
Bingo: "But how are we going to take a photo without the tablets?"
Bandit: "Ah, leave that to me!"
We cut to Bluey, Bandit and Bingo in the garage. Bandit rummages through a box.
Bandit: "This is all my stuff from when I used to be cool!"
Bluey looks confused, while Bingo smiles and shrugs at Bluey.
Bandit: "Ah, here it is!" 
Bluey and Bingo: "What is that?" 
Bandit: "THIS is what a REAL camera looks like."
The garage door opens to show Chilli standing next to a bike. We get a dramatic zoom on Chilli, posing by a bike.
Chilli: (whispering) "Are you ready, Bob?" 
Bob does a head-nod.
Bluey and Bingo: Woo!
A speechless Bandit snaps a picture with the camera. The scene cuts to Bingo sitting on a car seat as Chilli rides a bicycle. Bluey follows not far behind on her own bicycle. Bandit rides on a skateboard as he takes pictures. We cut to the park in Bingo's POV, where Bandit gives her a thumbs up. Bluey and Bingo giggle as they slide down the slide, Bandit taking a picture as they do. We then see Bingo spinning around on a playground ride.
Bingo: Whee!
We then see Bob swinging back and forth, with the camera zooming out to show Bingo riding a rocking unicorn ride at the playground.
Bingo: Wheeee! Hee!
Bluey makes a silly pose while holding Bob Bilby on her hand as Bingo takes a picture of her. Bob shakes the photo to get it to develop. The camera zooms back to show Bluey and Bilby dancing around while shaking the photos to develop them. Bob Bilby is being controlled by Bluey. We then cut to later, where Bob Bilby can be seen watching fireworks, which are being reflected on his eyes.
Bingo: Ooh!
Bingo and Bob Bilby look at each other. Bandit puts his hands on Bluey and Chilli's backs. Chilli puts her hands on Bandit and Bingo's backs. Stripe (coloured correctly this time, fortunately) and Trixie can be seen sitting nearby, watching the fireworks. The camera moves up to show the fireworks bursting in the sky. We cut to the Heeler house, where Bandit puts a photo in the scrapbook. Chilli puts one in as well as the kids watch. Bandit and Chilli nod at each other. We then fade to Bingo's kindy, where Bingo is showing her teacher and her classmates the photos from the scrapbook.
Bingo: And this is Bob visiting Daddy's friend, Stevo.
We see a photo of Bluey, Bingo and Bob Bilby in a firetruck.
Bingo: He let Bob turn the siren on, but it was very loud.
Pan to another photo, showing Bob Bilby looking at something in front of a stack of books.
Bingo: And this is Bob and I getting a book out of the library. The end.
Bingo closes the scrapbook. The whole class claps.
Mrs. Retriever: Well, Bingo, it looks like Bob has had a wonderful time staying with you. Now, why don't you give Bob to Missy. It's her turn with him next.
Missy walks to Bingo take Bob and the scrapbook. Bingo gives them to Missy.
Bingo: There you go, Bob.
Bob appears in front of Bingo, now under Missy's control.
Bingo: Thanks for visiting me. I hope you'd like to visit me again.
Bob waves goodbye to Bingo.
Bingo: Goodbye.
Missy leaves with Bob Bilby. Bingo turns away, then looks down sadly. Bob Bilby suddenly comes back and hugs Bingo, who returns the hug. The music during Bob's weekend fun montage starts up again, The credits then roll. Instead of Bluey dancing, Buddy comes in, picking his nose.
