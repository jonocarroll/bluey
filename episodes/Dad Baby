Open at The Heeler House. In the sitting room, Bluey, Bandit and Chilli are all in the sitting room; the parents watch Bluey scrub the floor with vigor - Bandit sipping on a cup and Chilli reading her magazine.
Bandit: You missed a spot, Bluey.
Bluey: Oh, do I have to get every bit?
Bandit: If you're gonna do something, do it properly.
Bluey: Okay...
Bluey goes back to scrubbing as Bingo enters from screen right, holding something.
Bingo: Mum, what's this? 
Chilli: Aww... that's your old papoose!
Bingo: Pa-poose?
Bandit: We used'ta walk you around the park with it instead of sleeping. Straps go 'round here... ...and baby goes in here!
Bluey: Get in it, Bingo!
Bingo: Okay!
Bingo gets on the sofa and slots herself into the gap.
Bandit: Hey! Oh, hang on - you're not a baby! Oh-umph-Ow!
Bingo giggles as she finds herself inside the papoose. Bluey has stopped scrubbing to see.
Bluey: Look, Dad has a baby in his belly!
Bingo giggles once more; Bluey gasps!
Bluey: I know what we can play! 
Bandit: Oh, no. Don't say it!
CUE TITLE CARD - Dad Baby - object shown is a dim-sim.
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called "Dad Baby".
Cut back to the sitting room. Bandit currently has a face that screams "Why do I gotta do this?"
Chilli: This... isn't gonna end well.
Bluey: Okay, you're pregnant with baby Bingo... So you have to act pregnant!
Bandit: Okay. If we're gonna do this, let's do it properly!
Bluey is now determined and excited! She smiles a wide smile as her tail wags to and fro.
Bandit: Hmm, how to act pregnant?
Bingo pops out of the papoose. Chilli closes her magazine and rolls it up...
Chilli: I'm just gonna get this ready...
Bandit clears his throat.
Bandit: Oh, my back! Oh, my feet! Grab my feet, Bluey... grab my feet.
Bluey giggles.
Chilli: Bandit Heeler!
Bandit: I'm hungry! Oh, I need to sit down! Oh, where's my vitamin E cream? Something about stretch marks...
Chilli whacks him with the mazagine, sending Bluey squealing and giggling!
Chilli: How dare you do that? You have no idea what I went through!
Bandit: How could you?! Ow-I'm with child!
They run off! Bandit follows a giggling Bluey into the hallway.
Bandit: Oh, slow down, Bluey. It's hard to run... Is she still following us?
He turns around, knocking everything off the table.
Bingo: Ow!
Bandit: Whoops.
Bingo giggles.
Bandit: Ah, I better clean that up...
He struggles to reach for the items.
Bandit: Oh, cheese and crackers! You're heavy, Bingo!
Inside the papoose, Bingo giggles again.
Bandit: Bluey, can you clean this up for me, mate?
Bluey: Okay!
Bluey gets to work cleaning up the items.
Bandit: I'm gonna sit down.
Bluey is suddenly knocked to the floor by Bandit's papoose. She giggles.
Bluey: Watch it, big belly! 
Bandit: Sorry.
He knocks her to the side once again. She giggles.
Bandit: Oh, man. I'm hungry!
Bandit follows Bluey into the kitchen.
Bluey: Okay, remember: you're eating for two people now.
Bandit: Sounds good to me.
Bluey tries to open the fridge door, but is stopped by the papoose.
Bingo: Ow! Watch it.
Second try's the charm.
Bluey: So... we've got cucumbers and radishes.
Bandit: Uh, I've actually got cravings for... these dim sims. 
Bluey: Dim sims?
Bandit: The baby wants dim sims.
Bingo peeks out the papoose, visibly excited.
Bluey: Okay.
As Bandit tries to eat one...
Bingo: Mine. 
Bandit: Hey!
She giggles.
Bandit: I'll try again.
Bingo: Mine. 
Bluey joins in giggling.
Bandit: Right.
Bingo: Mine. Mine.
Bandit: Hey, Bingo, I'm hungry!
Bingo is eating the dim-sims. She giggles. Now Bluey and Bandit exit to the backyard.
Bluey: C'mon! Pregnant people need exercise too.
Bandit: Oh, man, this thing is uncomfortable... Oh, my back... Forget this. I need to sit down.
And sits down he does.
Chilli: How's it going, pregnant man?
Bandit: Oh-uh - yeah-uh... It's... too easy, man. Dunno what all the fuss is about.
Chilli: Oh, good.
Bingo peeks out. Indeed, Bandit shows bravado, confidence, even. But...
Chilli: Well, soon, you'll start feeling the baby kicking...
And now his confidence is gone. Bingo pops back inside.
Bandit: Oh, no... I'm sure that's not for a little while-
He's wrong, for the baby starts to kick.
Bandit: Ow! Ow... ow!
Inside...
Bingo: Kick. Kick. Kick.
Bandit: Ohh, me guts...
Inside, Bingo giggles as she continues to kick.
Chilli: Oh, you never forget that first kick...
Bandit: ...oh! Okay, that's a wrap, kids. C'mon, unclip...
Bluey: No, not yet! You haven't had the baby.
Bingo: Kick! He-he.
Bandit: Oh-ho! Too bad. How do you get this thing... off?!
Bluey: You said if you're going to do something, do it properly!
Bingo: Kick!
Bandit: Oh! That advice doesn't apply to me...
...but Bingo pokes her head out of the bottom of the papoose!
Bingo: Hello!
Both Bluey and Bandit shriek!
Bluey: He's having a baby!
Soon, Bandit finds himself in the swimming pool, panting hard. Now the baby needs to be delivered...
Bluey: What happens now?
Bandit: What are you asking me for? Aren't you the midwife?
Bluey: No, I'm just a friend. I work at a petrol station.
Bandit: What?!
Bingo: I'm comin' out...!
Both Bluey and Bandit shriek once again!
Bandit: Well, who's gonna deliver my baby?
Someone off-screen: ðŸŽµ Hey, true blue / Is it me and you? ðŸŽµ
Bandit: Yes.
Cut to Pat setting up a sprinkler in his garden.
Pat: ðŸŽµ Is it Mum and Dad? Is it a- ðŸŽµ
Bluey pokes over the fence.
Bluey: Uh, Lucky's Dad, can you give us a hand with something?
Pat: Yeah, no worries, Bluey.
Cut to Pat kneeling beside a heavily-breathing Bandit.
Pat: I didn't know this was the something!
Bandit: Harden up, Pat.
Pat: But I don't know how to deliver a baby!
Bandit: I thought you grew up on a farm!
Pat: We grew sorghum!
Lucky comes out of his house.
Lucky: Dad, the cricket's started!
Pat: I'm busy, mate! Just shout if there's a wicket!
Lucky: Okay!
Lucky pops back inside.
Pat: Well, how hard can this be? I'll just grab a leg-
He's bitten by Bingo, who giggles and slots back inside!
Pat: Ow! Hey, where are you goin'?!
Bingo: I'm not goin' ANYWHERE!
Bingo slotting back inside elicits a tickle, making Bandit laugh.
Bandit: Bingo, that tickles!
Pat: Oh, we'll see about this!
Bingo squeals as Pat grasps her leg.
Pat: I've got a foot!
Bluey: Pull!
Pat tries to pull her out, but a squealing Bingo has grabbed onto Bandit's fur!
Bandit: Oh... she's got my belly hair!
Pat continues to try to pull Bingo out.
Lucky: It's none for six, Dad!
Pat: Any boundaries?
Lucky: One boundary, two singles.
Pat: Who got the boundary?
Well, Pat's distracted at the moment, so....
Bluey and Bandit: Focus!
Pat: Oh, yeah, sorry.
And Pat goes back to pulling Bingo; soon afterward, he's finally made progress, getting the bum out.
Pat: Ohh, I can see the butt! I can see the butt!
Bluey: Keep pulling!
Pat: C'mon, you little...
The dim-sims from earlier fall out.
Pat: I'm getting a lot of dim-sims!
Cut to Wendy in her garden.
Wendy: ðŸŽµ Oh, I do like to be beside the seaside- ðŸŽµ
Pat: Push!
Bluey: Keep pulling!
Pat: Morning, Wendy!
She turns around to look at the commotion, screams, and runs away. Bingo continues to lengthen the time it takes to deliver. This time, by tickling.
Bingo: Tickle-tickle-tickle-tickle. You'll never get me out!
Bandit continues to laugh as Pat also continues to pull her out. Suddenly...
Bandit: Ow!
Pat: She's not budging! We may have to go through the sunroof!
Bandit: Just get this thing outta me!
Bluey decides to throw her cap into the ring. She'll have a go...
Bluey: Give me a go.
She pushes Pat off.
Bluey: Get outta the way.
Bluey: Okay. I'll pull and you push.
Bandit: Okay!
Pat: Ooh, c'mon Bingo!
Bluey: Ready?
Pat and Bandit: Ready!
Now, Bluey starts to pull as Pat and Bandit start to push, with Bingo giggling all the while. This time, she's made some progress!
Bluey: It's working! Keep pushing!
They continue to do so...
Lucky: Dad, Sparky's out! Caught behind!
Pat: Oh, BISCUITS! Just gotta see this!- -oop!
Bandit: You're not going anywhere!
Bluey: Okay, baby, time to come out!
They're now in the final stretch! Bingo continues to giggle as she gets pulled out further.
Bandit: SING TO ME, PAT!
Pat: Oh, yeah, righto... ðŸŽµ Hey, true blue;.. ðŸŽµ
Bluey: Push, Dad!
Pat: ðŸŽµ Is it me and you? ðŸŽµ
Bingo: Tickle tickle.
Bandit laughs!
Pat: ðŸŽµ Is it Mum and Dad? Is it a cockatoo? Is it standing by your mate? ðŸŽµ ðŸŽµ
And Bingo's finally out!
Bandit: Hoo... BISCUITS!!!!!
He yells in pain - loudly, to the point a group of birds fly away! Bingo flies out of Bandit's papoose:
Bingo: Born!
Bluey and Pat: Hooray!
Bandit: Hooray...
Some time later, we're treated to a beautiful panning shot of the afternoon above. Bingo is on Bandit's arms.
Bingo: Meep, meep, meep.
Bluey: Now you have to give her a name!
Bandit: Oh, yeah! Let's get a look at you...
Bingo is on Bandit's arms, cooing ever-so-cutely. Bandit smiles warmly at the young Red Heeler.
Bandit: I'm going to call you Chilli.
Bluey is watching this with a smile on her face. Pat helps himself to some of the dim-sims.
Pat: Oh, you Heelers don't muck around!
Bandit: Well, if you're gonna do somethin'...
Bluey: ...do it properly.
Chilli: Well done, honey!
Chilli is on the balcony.
Chilli: She's beautiful!
Bandit: Oh, it was a doddle! Don't know what all the fuss is about.
Bluey: My turn!
She gets inside the pool!
Bandit: Eep.
Cue end credits - Bluey dances to a piece of music shown earlier in the episode.
