Bluey: Beep beep! Anyone need a taxi?
Bandit: Taxi! Taxi!
Bluey: Oh, a customer.
Bandit: (pants) I'm in a big hurry taxi driver, I need to get to the airport.
Bluey: Hop in, I can take you to the airport.
Bandit: Thanks, I'm late for my flight to Tasmania. 
Bluey: Yes sir.
Bandit: Umm, can I just check, you won't break down or get lost or pick up another passenger will you?
Bluey: Of course not.
Bandit: Oh good, because I've...

Bluey: Can I put that stroller in the boot for you?
Bingo: Please do.
Bandit: What's going on?
Bluey: Be with you in a moment sir. Feel free to get out and have a stretch.
Bandit: I haven't got time for this.
Bingo: (moves Bandit out of the way) I am a rich lady.
Bandit: (makes disgusted sounds)
Bluey: Where to madam? Click. 
Bingo: I'm taking Millicent to Stumblytastics.
Bluey: You've got it. (starts making taxi noises but is interrupted by Bandit)
Bandit: Hang on, I thought we were going to the airport first.
Bingo: Millicent will not be late!
Bandit: Okay!
Bluey: It's fine, it's probably on the way. Let's ask Satnav.
Bandit: Oh here we go.
Bluey: Beep. Satnav, take us to Stumblytastics please.
Chilli: Ok, calculating shortest route to Stumblytastics. Hmm, continue on this road for 500 meters.
Bluey: Thanks Satnav. Satnav will get us there in a jiffy.
Bandit: Well I should hope so.
Bluey: Beep beep! (starts making taxi noises)
Bingo: Oh no, Millicent is getting car-sick.
Bluey: Don't let her vomit on my seats.
Chilli: In 5 meters, turn left onto this road.
Bluey: Okay.
Chilli: I think. (Bandit starts to get worried).
Bluey: Turning left. 
Everyone in the Taxi leans to the left to make it look like they are in a real taxi that's turning left.
Chilli: Or was it right? I think it was right, I'm not quite sure. (Bandit looks worried)
Everyone in the Taxi leans to the right to make it look like they are in a real taxi that's turning right.
Chilli: Let's just see where this takes us.
Bandit: CHEESE AND CRACKERS! We're completely lost.
Bingo: Almost there Millicent.
Chilli: Oh wait, I recognize that kebab shop! Turn left here. Turn here!
Bluey: Okay! 
Everyone in the Taxi leans to the left to make it look like they are in a real taxi that's turning left.
Chilli: Oh no, this isn't right.
Bandit: OH, COME ON!
Chilli: Sorry.
Bluey: (giggles) Oh Satnav.
Bingo as Millicent: Waaa, me sick.
Chilli: Quick, get on this roundabout. 
Bluey: Okay.
Everyone in the Taxi leans to the left to make it look like they are in a real taxi that's turning left.
Chilli: Actually, there is a really good dress shop around here. 
Bandit: Satnav, focus!
Chilli: Oh yes, sorry. Turn left here.
Everyone in the Taxi leans to the left to make it look like they are in a real taxi that's turning left.
Chilli: Now, stop! 
Bingo as Millicent: (pretends to vomit).
Bandit: AHH! This baby is vomiting all over me!
Bingo: Her name is Millicent!
Chilli: You have arrived at Stumblytastics, to the best of my knowledge. 
Bandit: Finally.
Bingo: This isn't Stumblytastics!
Bluey: Yeah, this is the Zoo.
Bandit: BEANS ON TOAST!
Bingo: Why did you take us to the zoo?
Chilli (wistfully): I really wanted to see the penguins.
Bluey: (giggles) Oh Satnav.
Bingo as Millicent: I want to see the penguins too.
Bingo: Okay let's go.
Bingo gets out of the taxi with Millicent, and begins walking out of frame.
Bluey: I'll get your stroller. Unclick. Oh passenger. Feel free to have a stretch.
Bandit: I don't want to have a stretch. PLEASE can't you just take me to the airport? I'm late for my flight.
Bluey: Sure.
Bandit: Oh okay, let's go, we can just make it.
Bluey hops back into the taxi and attempts to turn the key.
Bluey: Click, I'll just turn the key. Mi mi mi mi mi, mi mi mi mi mi. Oh dear.
Bandit: What is it?
Bluey: Car won't start.
Bandit: Oh, GOODNESS GRAVY!
Bluey: Not to worry, I'll call the mechanic. (makes telephone noises) Its ringing. Hello mechanic. 
Bingo (as the mechanic): Hello love. What's your problem?
Bluey: We've broken down. 
Bingo: I'll be right there love.

Bandit: What is it now, why have we stopped?!
Chilli as a granny: We need to get some sausages love.
Bingo as a granny: How many do we need?

Chilli as a security woman: Yes, you just made it. Boarding pass?
Bandit: Oh, yes, of course.
Chilli as a security woman: (sniffs, waving her hand in front of her nose) What's that smell?
Bandit: Baby vomit.
Chilli as a security woman: Oh well, the plane is just through here, you have seat 4F just to your left. Have a nice flight.
