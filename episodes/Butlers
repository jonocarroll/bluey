Title Card - Butlers
The title card features a drawing of a red and green macaw, which squawks.
 Cut to a drawing, showing topiaries of a kangaroo, elephant, and unicorn outside the front steps of a house. A brown and white dog wearing a flat cap approaches, looking nervous. He climbs the steps and rings the doorbell.
Doorbell: ♫ "Ding-dong, Bluey and Bingo, they are the best!" ♫
A grey and white dog with a red bowtie and coiffed hair answers the door.
Monty: (formally) "Bluey and Bingo's dreamhouse, how may I help you?"
Barnsley: "My name is Barnsley. I'm here for the new butler's job?"
Monty brightens up and shakes Barnsley's hand.
Monty: "Oh, yes, Barnsley! Good to meet you."
Monty leads Barnsley into the house.
Monty: "My name is Monty, I'm head butler..."
Monty jumps over a patch of floor just inside the door.
Monty: "...Do come in."
Barnsley steps on the patch of floor, which turns out to be a trapdoor. It gives way, dropping him into a shaft above a crocodile pit. Monty catches his hand.
Barnsley: "Aaaah!"
The crocodiles snap at Barnsley, who attempts to dodge their teeth.
Monty: "Ope. Yeah, watch out for that. The children set up traps..."
Monty pulls on Barnsley's arm, allowing him to climb back up out of the pit.
Monty: "...in case their parents try and make them go to bed. C'mon, off we go."
The scene cuts to a new room in the house. It has a chandelier, sofa, and potted plants - but also an assortment of parrots, toucans, and a peacock. The walls are decorated with a row of blue circles. Monty and Barnsley enter through a door.
Monty: "This is the entry room."
Blue-and-Yellow Macaw: "Rawwwk!"
Golden Conure: "Bluey is the best!"
Blue-and-Yellow Macaw: "Bingo is the best!"
Monty: "Pretty fancy."
Barnsley: "What are all the blue buttons?"
Monty: "Ugh, well..."
Cut to a wider shot, revealing an elevator further into the room. The door opens, revealing a polar bear elevator attendant. Bluey prances out.
Monty: "The children ordered a bubble tea dispenser..."
Bluey presses one of the buttons on the wall. A panel slides back, revealing the bubble tea dispenser, which puts boba, tea, and then a straw into the glass.
Monty: "...to be located at least every four metres, at all times."
Bluey skips off, slurping her tea.
Barnsley: "Ah. Fascinating."
Cut to a laboratory. The laboratory floor contains a giant robot Chattermax, a pig jetpack, a cupcake launcher, and laboratory glassware containing pizza, burgers, and ice cream. Jerry Lee observes from the catwalk, accompanied by two lab assistant butlers with clipboards. Monty and Barnsley enter along the catwalk.
Monty: "All of our dreamhouse inventions are designed by our science butler, Jerry Lee."
Barnsley: "What's he making now?"
Bingo enters, walking along the lower level in a purple sequined dress with a long train. A butler with a sewing needle and measuring tape follows close behind her, working on the train.
Monty: "Ah, well, the childrens' ballgowns drop lots of sequins on the carpet."
A pink robot vacuum emerges from a hatch in the wall. It follows after Bingo and the butler, sucking up fallen sequins.
Monty: "So Jerry Lee has made a robot that picks them up again, and Fred, our sequins butler, sticks 'em back on.
The robot vacuum launches sequins to Fred, who dutifully sews them back on. Jerry Lee nods approvingly, and the lab assistant butlers clap politely.
Cut to the kitchen, which, in addition to regular kitchen utensils, has a huge screen, and shelves for pastries, pizza, chips, and beans, as well as cereal dispensers. A large white dog is rolling out dough.
Monty: "This is Harlow, our kitchen butler."
Barnsley: "Hello!"
Harlow switches to whisking the contents of a blue bowl.
Monty: (sternly) "No! You mustn't interrupt Harlow."
Harlow chops up a cake, then zips over to the stovetop. He flips the contents of a pan.
Monty: "He is the busiest butler in the whole dreamhouse."
A bell dings. The wall screen displays a sausage sandwich, made with fairy bread. Harlow turns to look.
Harlow: "Oh, no."
Behind him, a ticket printer begins to print.
Monty: "That ding means that the children have ordered some food."
Harlow starts Bluey's order, even as it continues to print longer and longer.
Harlow: "Okay. Bluey wants a fairy bread sausage sandwich but with no orange sprinkles, and the sausage has to be cut up, and the tomato sauce needs to be not the sugar-free tomato sauce."
Harlow: (sighing) "Okay. I can do that."
Harlow zips to the refrigerator, but as soon as he opens it, the bell dings again, and the image on the TV changes to a bowl of green ice cream with brown spots, and "Bluey Christine Heeler" written on it in hundreds-and-thousands. Harlow closes the fridge and turns to look.
Harlow: "Oh, what now?"
He goes back to the ticket printer, which is producing another ticket.
Harlow: "Oh, she's changed her mind. She doesn't like fairy bread sausage sandwiches anymore. Okay. Now she wants 'a big bowl of citrus lime ice cream, but then poke big holes in it with your fingers to make lots of tunnels, and then pour freezy chocolate into those tunnels and then let it freeze, and then spell my name out with hundreds-and-thousands on top, but it has to be my whole name, including my middle name Christine as well in joinedy-up writing and put sparklers on it.'"
Harlow sighs.
Harlow: "Man. I should've followed my dad into banking."
Harlow opens the fridge and starts looking for ingredients. Monty leans towards Barnsley.
Monty: "You do not want to be the kitchen butler."
Cut to a bathroom, with a mirror, bathtub, and a nozzle on the ceiling. The surrounding rooms each have a toilet with stink lines. Monty and Barnsley enter through the door.
Monty: "Or the toilet butler. There are fifty toilets in the Dream House, and they all stink!"
A depressed-looking white dog with a bushy moustache, mop, and bucket enters the bathroom by climbing a flight of stairs, and opens the door to a neighboring toilet.
Monty: "Isn't that right, Jenkins?"
Jenkins: "Oh, not again."
Looking even more depressed, Jenkins trudges into the toilet room."
Monty: "And the children always forget to flush."
Barnsley: "Um... so... What type of butler am I?"
Cut to the balcony. Barnsley and Monty stand next to the spa. There are a pair of toy unicorns in the spa, and Monty is holding a pool skimmer net.
Monty: "You are the spa bath butler. It's your job to keep the spa clean..."
Monty uses the pool skimmer net to remove a unicorn from the spa.
Monty: "...and fish out any toys that get jammed in the skimmer."
Monty hands Barnsley the skimmer net and unicorn.
Barnsley: "Oh, well. That doesn't seem too bad!"
Barnsley attempts to fish the other unicorn out of the spa.
Monty: "Yeah... it's mostly pretty straightforward—"
A loudspeaker blares, startling them both.
Bluey: (over loudspeaker) "Butler! I want to go to Chloe's dreamhouse."
Monty: "—when the dreamhouse isn't moving."
Cut to a wide shot of the first floor of the dreamhouse.
Robotic Voice: "Initiating Flight Mode."
The entire house is lifted by a huge pink spring. Four rockets deploy at the base of the house, and it launches into the air.
Cut back to the balcony.
Barnsley: "Aaah!"
Barnsley and Monty both dash for the heavy steel door. Monty makes it inside, but the door slams shut behind him, leaving Barnsley trapped outside.
Monty: "Good luck! See you for Friday night drinks at the butlers' lounge!"
Monty runs further into the house. Barnsley clings to the balcony as the camera pulls back, showing the whole house launching straight upwards.
Barnsley: "Aaaaaaah!"
