The episode starts at the kitchen. Chilli is preparing dinner and is visibly stressed. Bluey is playing her recorder.
Bingo: Knock, knock.
Chilli: Bluey, that's a bit loud, honey.
Bluey: Sorry! (she continues to play her recorder)
Bingo: (she knocks on Chilli's apron) Knock, knock!
Chilli: Oh, who's there, hon?
Bingo: Potato!
Chilli: Bluey. Too loud! (to Bingo) Potato who?
Bingo: Potato drives a car to the potato shop, and... buys a potato. (laughs)
Chilli: That's a good one, Bingo.
Bluey hits a high note on her recorder.
Chilli: Bluey!
Bluey: Sorry! (she puts down the recorder])
Bingo: (she pulls on Chilli's apron) Knock, knock!
Bandit walks in.
Bandit: Hey kids, I'm back from my haircut!
Bluey and Bingo: Dad!
Bingo runs up to Bandit and hugs him.
Chilli: Right. Dinner's in the slow cooker and they've had afternoon tea. (to Bandit, serious) I need 20 minutes when no one comes near me.
Bluey: (sadly) What?
Bandit: Oh. Yep. Ok!
Chilli walks away.
Bandit: (to Bluey and Bingo) Come on, kids. Daddy-daughter time.
Bingo: Hooray!
Chilli: (offscreen) And you've got a mullet!
Bandit: She said they were back in!
Music plays.
Bluey: Is Mum ok?
Bandit: Yep.
Bluey: Did we do something wrong?
Bingo: And what's a mullet?
Bandit: (points to Bluey) No, you didn't, (points to Bingo) and it's a type of haircut that cool people are starting to get again.
Bluey: Does she wish she never had us?
Bandit: Nah, Bluey. Of course not. She just needs 20 minutes.
Pat: Ha! Nice mullet, Bandit! (laughs)
Bandit sighs.
Bluey: I'm just going to see if she's ok.
Bandit: Whoa! Hey, hey! No! Don't do that. Stay here! You can, um, watch me do the cancan!
The finale of Orpheus in Hades plays, Bandit dances the cancan.
Bandit: (to the tune of the song) Dun! Da da da da da da! Dun da da da da da!
Bingo laughs. Bluey is unamused.
Bandit: (continued) Da da da da da, da da ta ta, hey!
Orpheus in Hades ends, Bandit stops dancing.
Beat.
Bluey: I'm going to see Mum.
Bandit: No, no, no, wait. Isn't there some sort of game that you always want to play that I can't stand?
Bluey: (she smiles and wags her tail) Yes?
Bandit: Right. Well, let's play that!
Bluey: What? For real life?
Bandit: Oh, hang on. What is it again?
Bluey and Bingo: Sheep dog!!
Bandit: (bummed) Ugh, that's right.
TITLE CARD: SHEEPDOG
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called, "Sheepdog".
The scene changes to the backyard. Bandit acts like a sheep by crawling.
Bluey: Come on, sheepdog, come on!
Bandit bleats. Bingo giggles. Bandit bleats again.
Bingo: (plucks some grass) Have some grass, sheepdog.
Bandit: (pretending to eat the grass) Chomp chomp chomp.
Bingo: No, you have to eat it for real life.
Bandit licks the grass from Bingo's hand. He spits it out and bleats.
Bluey: Aww, look at your big, fluffy coat. Ooh, let's put a ribbon in his hair.
Bingo: Ooh, yeah. Where are the ribbons?
Bluey: I don't know. I'll ask Mum.
Bluey runs towards the house. Bandit chases after her while crawling, bleating worriedly. Bandit runs in front of Bluey before she can get to the house.
Bluey: (giggles) Out of the way, sheepy!
Bluey tries to go around Bandit, but he keeps blocking her. Bandit jumps in an attempt to block Bluey, but he fails and Bluey makes it to the house.
Bluey: (raised voice) Mum?
Bandit bleats. He looks around outside, then looks straight ahead. The scene briefly changes to the inside of the house.
Bluey: (raised voice) Mum? Mum, where are you?!
Bingo: (offscreen) Bluey, help!
The scene changes back to outside where Bandit has gotten onto the trampoline. He jumps while still in a crawling position, bleating as he jumps. Bingo giggles.
Bluey: What's going on?
Bingo: He went on and now he can't get off.
Bluey: Sheeps don't go on trampolines. (she plucks grass) Here, sheepy sheepy! (she unzips the trampoline net) I've got some nice grass for you!
Bingo: It doesn't like grass!
Bluey: Well, how are we gonna get him off?
The doorbell rings.
Bingo: Ooh, someone's at the door!
Bluey: Don't worry, Mum will get it.
Bandit stops jumping and starts running normally to the house. He bleats.
Bluey: Hey! Sheep can't walk!
The scene changes to the front door. Bandit answers the door and is greeted by Alt Energy Dog.
Alt Energy Dog: Hi! How would you like to save $200 a year on your energy bill?
Bandit bleats.
Alt Energy Dog: Excuse me?
Bandit bleats slightly louder.
Alt Energy Dog: (nervously) Uh, is there someone else I could talk to?
Bluey: I'll go get my mum!
Bandit bleats nervously and quickly rushes to stop Bluey by grabbing her leg.
Bluey: Ah! Let go!
Bingo: (she picks up a ribbon on the table next to the front door) Ribbon! (she ties the ribbon on Bandit's tail)
Alt Energy Dog: (looking at the chaos taking place inside) Uh... I'll come back another time.
Bluey: (straining) I know what you're doing. You don't want me to see Mum! (she gets her leg free) Well, it's not gonna work! (she runs offscreen)
Bingo: (she finishes tying the ribbon on Bandit's tail) There!
Bandit bleats and crawls outside.
Bingo: Where are you going now, sheepy?
The scene changes to outside of Bandit and Chilli's bedroom door. Bluey walks up to the door.
Bluey: Mum? Are you in there?
Chilli: Yes, Bluey, I'm in here.
Bluey: I'm sorry for whatever I did to upset you.
Chilli: (opens the bedroom door) You didn't do anything to upset me, sweetheart.
Bluey: Then why don't you want to see us?
Chilli: (kneels down to Bluey's level) I do want to see you, but it can be hard work looking after kids. Sometimes mums just need 20 minutes.
Bluey: I don't understand.
Chilli: You will one day, sweetheart.
Bingo: (offscreen) Ah! No, sheepy, no!
Bandit bleats offscreen.
Chilli: What is that about?
Bluey: Well, Dad's trying to stop me from bothering you.
Chilli: Oh. I see.
Bluey: But it won't work.
Chilli chuckles.
Wendy: (screams) What's going on?!
Bluey and Chilli: (gasp) Wendy!
Chilli: Go, go, go!
The scene changes to Wendy's backyard. Bandit is eating Wendy's laundry while Wendy sprays him with water. Bingo stands there and giggles.
Wendy: Stop that! Shoo! Shoo, you naughty sheep!
Bluey: Ah, sheepy, no!
Bandit pulls Wendy's garmet off the line.
Wendy: Oh!
Bandit bleats.
Wendy: Drop it. (she lifts her finger) Drop it!
Bandit shakes his head.
Wendy: (points her finger to the ground) Drop it! You are a very cheeky sheep.
Bluey: I'm sorry, Wendy. He doesn't listen to what anyone says.
Bandit bleats. Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Wendy: That's it, I'm getting Chilli.
Bandit drops the garmet and bleats worriedly. He turns and faces Wendy's back while kicking his legs.
Bluey and Bingo: Sheepy, no!
Bandit charges at Wendy.
Wendy: Chilli?
Bandit rams Wendy in the behind. Wendy drops her water bottle when Bandit rams her.
Wendy: Ooh!
The scene goes quiet.
Bingo: Oh, dear.
Wendy: (lifts her finger) That... will not... happen... twice.
Bandit bleats. Wendy growls. Bandit bleats again.
Wendy: (yelling) Chilli!
Bluey: Wait, stop! He doesn't want you to yell to Mum.
Wendy: Why not?
Bingo: Because Mum says, "I just need 20 minutes when no-one says anything to me."
Wendy: Oh! I see. And this sheep has been making sure no-one bothers her.
Bandit bleats.
Bluey: I think she wishes she didn't have children.
Wendy: That is not true, my love. Why don't you kids go upstairs and play with Judo? I'll look after your sheep for you.
Bluey and Bingo: (excitedly, wagging their tails) For real life?! Are you sure?
Wendy: Yes. I know a bit about sheep. My grandad was a shearer, you know?
Bingo: What's a shearer?
Wendy: A shearer is someone who gives sheep haircuts, (she touches Bandit's mullet), which is good timing.
Bandit bleats nervously.
Bluey: Thanks, Wendy!
Bluey and Bingo start running off. Bandit bleats nervously. Bluey stops and Bingo continues running offscreen.
Bluey: Oh. Yeah. Don't worry, sheepy, we still love you. It's just... it's hard work looking after you.
Wendy: They just need 20 minutes.
Bluey: Yeah. Bye!
Bandit bleats. He and Wendy stare at each other for a brief moment.
Wendy: I'll get the clippers. (she walks offscreen)
Bandit bleats. The scene changes back to the inside of the Heeler's house, where Chilli walks out of her bedroom. Chilli takes a deep breath. She walks into the kitchen.
Chilli: Hello?
Chilli walks onto the balcony.
Chilli: Hello?
Bluey and Bingo: (from the balcony in Wendy's house playing with Judo) Hi, Mum!
Chilli: Oh! Hi, girls!
Bluey: Did you have a good 20 minutes?
Chilli: I did, thanks!
Bluey: Me too!
Chilli: Where's your dad?
Bandit bleats offscreen.
Wendy: Oh, pipe down, you big sook!
Bandit bleats.
Chilli: Um... Hi, Wendy!
Wendy: Oh! Hi, Chilli! How are you feeling, darl'?
Chilli: I'm... good, thanks.
Wendy: Oh, that's the shot. (to Bandit) Sit still!
Chilli: Um... is everything okay?
Bandit shakes his head while bleating.
Wendy: Yep, all good here! Just sorting out this mullet.
Bandit side-eyes Wendy while bleating.
Chilli: Oh! Thanks!
Wendy: You go relax. I'll pop him over the fence when he's done.
Chilli: Um, okay. Thanks, Wendy!
Bluey and Bingo: See ya, Mum!
Bandit bleats.
Wendy: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bandit bleats.
End credits.
