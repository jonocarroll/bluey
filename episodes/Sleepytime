The episode opens with a night view of the Heeler house, then cuts to the kids' bedroom, where Chilli is reading Bingo a bedtime story.
Chilli: And then Baby Chick hatched out of her egg.
Bingo: Oooh!
Chilli: And the first thing she saw was her Mummy Chicken.
Bingo: Yay!
Meanwhile, Bandit drags Bluey on the floor as she giggles, and places her on her bed.
Bandit: Bed. Sleep. Now.
Bluey: Aww... But I'm not tired. 
Bluey suddenly collapses asleep as Bandit places her blanket over her. Bandit walks off and wishes Bingo goodnight.
Bandit: Night, Bingo.
Bingo: Night, Dad.
Chilli: So Baby Chick snuggled up her Mummy Chick and drifted off to sleep. The end.
Chilli closes the book.
Chilli: Okay, sleepytime now.
Bingo pulls out a book under her pillow as Chilli is about to leave, one that appears to be about outer space.
Bingo: Just one more!
Chilli: Bingo!
Bingo pulls a "please face" to convince Chilli.
Bingo: Please...! 
Chilli: Okay. One more, then sleepytime.
Bingo: Hurray!
The title card is shown with the episode's title: Sleepytime. There are two books above the title.
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called, "Sleepytime".
We cut back to Bluey and Bingo's bedroom, where Chilli is now reading to Bingo the book about planets.
Chilli: And what's this planet called?
Bingo: Mercury.
Chilli: Good. And the big, hot star in the middle?
Bingo: The sun!
Chilli: That's right. Clever girl. 
Chilli closes the book.
Chilli: Now, sleepytime.
Chilli kisses Bingo's forehead and turns off the bedside lamp. She starts to walk off until Bingo stops her.
Bingo: Where's Floppy?
Chilli looks down and notices Floppy laying on the floor by the bed.
Chilli: Ooh. Here she is.
Bingo: Floppy!
Chilli gives Floppy to Bingo, who hugs her tight.
Chilli: Mustn't forget Floppy.
Bingo: Mum, I want to do a big girl sleep tonight and wake up in my own bed.
Chilli: You do your best, honey. But remember, I'm always here if you need me.
Bingo: Okay.
Chilli: Sweet dreams.
Chilli closes the door as Bingo falls asleep. The camera then pans onto the back of the space book. We pan in until we see a shot of the Earth. The Earth suddenly starts to crack until Bingo pops up from inside, magma floating out of the cracked planet.
Bingo: Ooh!
Bingo turns her head as she hears cracking coming from something nearby. The moon is shown cracking, until Floppy pops her head out. Floppy turns and notices Bingo, waving at her. Bingo smiles as she sees Floppy, floating over to go hug Floppy. As Bingo floats towards Floppy, the Earth completely falls apart, leaving the magma to float all over. Bingo and Floppy hug each other as a wall of sound plays. In real life, Bingo can be seen hugging Floppy while sleeping. The two hug for a bit until Bingo notices the sun. Bingo and FLoppy smile as they start floating towards the sun. The two float past Venus, which has its top hatched. Bluey has hatched from Venus in Bingo's dream. We cut back to real life, where Bingo is imitating floating while sleeping, and Bluey's bed has been abandoned. The music abruptly stops as we cut to Bluey, who is standing at Bandit and Chilli's bedside. Chilli suddenly opens her eyes, spotting Bluey standing there. Chilli shrieks as she notices her.
Chilli: Oh, Bluey.
Bluey: Can I have a drink of water?
Chilli: (yawning) Okay, honey.
Chilli gets a glass of water from the bathroom sink and returns to find Bluey sleeping next to Bandit. Chilli walks to Bluey and Bingo's room and lays down in Bluey's bed. Bingo is still imitating floating. After a bit, Bingo gets up from her bed and starts walking off while "floating". We cut back to Bingo's dream, where we see the planet Uranus. Bingo giggles as she lays down on the planet's surface, finding it soft as a blanket. In real life, Bingo has grabbed a portion of a blanket that Bluey and Bandit are using as well. Bandit yaps and grabs the blanket, rolling Bingo towards Bluey. Bluey giggles and grabs the blanket, launching her towards Bandit. Bandit grabs the blanket again, making Bingo roll. We return to Bingo's dream, where Bingo and Floppy are rolling about the planet's surface, giggling. In real life, Bluey grabs the blanket, making Bingo roll to Bandit. Bandit yaps and the two grab the blanket at the same time, launching Bingo in the air. Back in Bingo's dream, Bingo was launched upwards. She looks over to see Jupiter. 
Bingo: Wow!
Bingo floats towards Jupiter and slaps the surface, making the surface splash a bit.
Bingo: Ooh!
Bingo giggles as she slaps the surface a few more times. In real life, Bingo is slapping Bandit in the face, who yaps every time he's slapped. Back in Bingo's dream, Bingo slaps the surface one more time before she floats off. Bingo suddenly comes back, propelling herself towards the surface. In real life, Bingo had just kicked Bandit in the stomach, who whimpers. We cut back to the dream, where Bingo and Floppy are now running around on Jupiter's surface. In real life, Bingo is now mimicking running on Bandit's back, who whimpers the whole time. We cut back to the dream, where Bingo is giggling as she runs. Bluey suddenly comes in and giggles as she runs with Bingo. In real life, Bluey and Bingo are now both kicking Bandit. Now in the dream, the two giggle as they start stomping on Jupiter. We cut back to real life, where the two are stomping on Bandit's head and back. Bandit pushes Bluey away, which is represented by her being hit by a meteor in the dream. Bingo giggles as she goes back to running, continuing all the way until she sees the red dot. Bingo then jumps on Jupiter's great red spot. We cut back to real life, where Bingo has just kicked Bandit in the groin.
Bandit: (anguished) Ohhhhh...biscuits!
Bingo and Floppy go beneath Jupiter's surface, hugging the planet's core. Bandit takes Bingo back to her own bed, passing the bathroom as he does. Bandit tucks Bingo into bed, gently patting her. As Bandit walks back down the hallway, Bluey is now on the toilet, trying to stay awake..
Bluey: Dad, can you sing to me?
Bandit starts to sing a version of "99 Bottles of Beer" with altered lyrics.
Bandit: 99 bottles of thing on the wall, 99 bottles of thing...and if one of these bottles should happen to fall, there'll be 98 bottles of thing on the wall.
As Bandit sings to Bluey, Bingo walks past, still pretending to float. Bingo has laid down in her parent's bed, happily underneath the blanket with Floppy. Bandit and Bluey come back, where Bandit appears surprised that Bluey gets up on the bed and lays on the other side.
Bandit: Huh?
Bluey falls asleep on the empty side of the bed. Bandit sighs and lies down on the floor, only for Bluey to kick him, making him yap again. Bluey kicks him a few more times until she falls on top of him, making the blanket fall with her. Bingo curls up with FLoppy, shivering from not having a blanket. In Bingo's dream, she and Floppy are now on the planet Pluto, shivering miserably. Bingo looks over to see the Sun, obscured by the other planets. Bingo floats off with Floppy towards the sun. In real life, Bingo gets up from the bed and walks off to her own bed. In the dream, she flies towards Saturn, where the ring is made out of what must be thousands of bunnies just like Floppy. Floppy notices a particular purple bunny who smiles at him in the ring. She perks up and points at the planet, causing Bingo to look down sadly. She then sadly smiles and opens her arms for a hug. Floppy gives Bingo a hug, before Floppy breaks it and waves bye to Bingo. Bingo waves back as Floppy happily joins her brethren in Saturn's ring. Devastated, Bingo starts crying gently from losing her beloved friend. In real life, Bingo softly cries while waving at nothing. Chilli wakes up, hearing Bingo's soft cries. Bingo cries a bit more until she hears something coming. The approaching item is revealed to be a comet, taking Bingo with it. The comet takes her on a beeline towards the sun. She hops off the comet and lands on the planet Mercury, taking a second to sit on it. Bingo looks at the sun, smiling as she takes in its warmth. In real life, Chilli is now laying right next to Bingo, holding her close. Back in Bingo's dream, she looks at the broken Earth and realises that she needs to leave.
Bingo: I have to go. I'm a big girl now.
The sun is shown, representing Chilli. Her voice plays with a reverb effect.
Chilli: Remember, I'll always be here for you, even if you can't see me, because I love you.
This causes Bingo's tail to wag. We cut back to real life, where Chilli tucks Bingo in, kissing her forehead before leaving the room. Back in the dream, Bingo floats towards the broken Earth and starts trying to reassemble it. On the way back to her room, Chilli finds Floppy, who was discarded in the corridor.
Chilli: Oop. Mustn't forget Floppy.
She picks Floppy up and starts bringing her back to Bingo. Meanwhile in Bingo's dream, she's trying to get back into the Earth she hatched out of, but can't reach some of the pieces since they're too far.
Bingo: Aw.
Bingo looks to the side to see Floppy and three other bunnies. Floppy waves at Bingo and floats to the Earth with her friends to help Bingo fix it. Bingo hugs Floppy as the other bunnies put the planet back together piece by piece, as Floppy waving goodbye at Bingo. The dream ends as the Earth finishes reconstruction. The music swells as we cut to different shots of the house, where everything is now peaceful in the Heeler house. Bandit is seen hugging Bluey while sleeping on the floor with a blanket draped over them. Chilli is seen sleeping alone in the adults' bed, smiling. We then see Bingo sleeping in her own bed, hugging Floppy still. Dawn starts to come in as it's made clear that Bingo has fulfilled her promise to sleep in her own bed after all. We cut to the credits, where instead of the usual blue background, we get a starry background instead.
