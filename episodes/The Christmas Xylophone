The short opens showing the Heeler house with christmas decorations in the night, the scene changes showing the inside of Heeler's house where Bluey enters stealthily and looks back, as she approaches to the christmas tree and looks at the christmas presents.
Bluey: Ohh.
Bluey looks back again and walks to the right of the Christmas tree, where a bag of toys are. Bluey picks up a present with a spherical form. she (Bluey) shakes the present, that produces a bell sound and holds it up close her ears. Bluey shakes the present again, as her tail touches the toys bag.
She looks at the toys bag surprised and drops the present, Bluey spins towards the toys bag and searches in the bag. She takes her xylophone, walks towards rug, put the xylophone in the rug and sits.
Bluey plays " Jingle Bells" with her xylophone but plays a wrong note. She then looks around her and continues playing "Jingle Bells" this time with more accuracy.
Bluey smiles as her tail wags, she continues playing "Jingle Bells" this time with even greater accuracy, Bluey giggles and moves her arms, she continues the song, this time with a perfect accuracy.
Bluey finishes the song and giggles as her tail wags.
Bluey: Hooray!
