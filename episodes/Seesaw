The episode starts in the park, with Pom Pom's Mum and Bandit talking.
Pom Pom's Mum: (To Bandit) "Oh I know, that's-"
Camera cuts to Chilli playing "washing" with Bluey, Bingo and Pom Pom, using a gymnastics bar to hang the children from.
Chilli: "Okay, just one last bit of washing to hang out!"
Chilli picks up Bingo and places her on the bar.
Chilli: "There! All my washing is hung out! Now, to relax.."
With Chilli's back turned, Bluey and Bingo suddenly drop from the bar, cheering as they alert Chilli. A surprised Pom Pom is left hanging on the bar alone.
Chilli: "Oh no! The wind's blowing my washing off the line! I have to get it back!"
Chilli chases after the two. She manages to grab Bingo, much to her joy.
Pom Pom: "Mrs. Heeler!"
The shot cuts to a sad Pom Pom, feeling left out and unable to get off the bar due to it being a long way down. Chilli runs over.
Chilli: "Oh, sorry, Pom Pom! It's a long way down for you, isn't it?"
Pom Pom: "Yes, Mrs. Heeler. Pomeranians are a small breed!"
Chilli smiles and puts Pom Pom down on the ground.
Chilli: "There you go. Now to get my washing back!"
Pom Pom happily runs around as the game picks back up again, with Bluey and Bingo running from Chilli. She picks up Bluey this time.
Pom Pom: "Mrs. Heeler!"
The shot cuts to Pom Pom struggling to make a small climb up the ledge to join the game.
Pom Pom: "I can't do it! Maybe it's best if I don't play washing."
Pom Pom runs off, much to the dismay of Bluey and Bingo.
Bluey, Bingo: "Pom Pom!"
The shot cuts to Bandit and Pom Pom's Mum talking.
Bandit: "Well I'm still an enthusiast, I go along you know... have a go at it."
Pom Pom runs to her mum, whimpering as her mum comforts her. The shot goes back to Bluey, Bingo and Chilli.
Chilli: "Oh, poor Pom Pom."
Bingo runs off to the seesaw.
Bluey: "Well, she is a bit small for this game."
Chilli: "There's nothing wrong with small, honey.
Bingo: "Hey, Bluey! Come play seesaw!"
Bluey: "Yeah!"
TITLE CARD: Seesaw
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Seesaw."
Bluey, Bingo: "Seesaw, Margery Daw..."
The two continue to sing. The shot cuts to Pom Pom's Mum, Chilli, and Bandit talking while Bandit looks down to see Pom Pom pouting in her mum's arms. Bandit looks to the Heeler sisters, and gets an idea. He gets up and walks over to the seesaw. As he gets there he pushes Bingo off.
Bingo: "Hey!"
Bandit: "This is mine."
Bluey: "Hey! Get off!"
Bingo: "Yeah, get off! We were on that!"
Bandit: "Not anymore."
Bluey slides down to lightly kick Bandit.
Bluey: "Come on Bingo, help me!"
Bluey and Bingo attempt to push Bandit off, but to no avail.
Bandit: "Oooh, a massage! Why thank you! Yeah, a little lower. That's the spot!" 
Bingo: "Grab his arms!"
Bluey pulls Bandit's arm and tries to pull him, while Bingo continues to kick his back.
Bandit: "Oh yeah! Thai style. Oh, that feels good!"
Bingo and Bluey give up trying to force him off.
Bingo: "Get off, you big blue meanie!"
Bandit: "Nah."
Bluey: "I've got an idea. Come on, Bingo! We'll seesaw him off!"
Bingo: "Oh yeah!"
Bluey and Bingo attempt to force the seesaw down to get Bandit off, but to no succession.
Bingo: "We're not heavy enough!"
Bandit: "Yeah. I'm pretty huge."
Just then, Chloe enters, kicking a pine cone as she laughs.
Bluey: "Hey Chloe! Come up here and help us seesaw Dad off!"
Chloe: "Ooh, okay!"
Bluey: "We're gonna more heavy you off now, big daddy!"
Bandit: "Oooh! I'm so scared!"
Bluey: "Okay, sit down Chloe!"
Bingo: "We're still not heavy enough!"
Bluey: "He must weigh the same as a hippo!"
Bandit lightly sits up, causing the seesaw to shift and the trio of pups to bounce upwards.
Bluey: "That's it, I'm calling Mum!"
Bandit: "Oh yeah, run to your momma."
Bluey: "Muuuuum!"
Bingo: "She'll sort you out, mate!"
Chilli enters, carrying two sausages.
Chilli: "Hello!"
Bluey: "Mum, dad's sitting on the seesaw and he won't get off!"
Chilli: "Oh, boo-hoo!"
The trio gasp, taken aback by Chilli's unexpected response. She hands the sausages to Bandit.
Chilli: "Here you are, my darling!"
Bandit: "Oh, thank you my precious!"
Bluey: "What are you doing?!"
Bingo: "Don't feed him!"
Bluey: "You're making him even more heavy!"
Bandit: "Mmm, so filling!"
Chilli: "Have fun, children!"
Chilli exits.
Bingo: "This is outrageous!"
Chloe: "The grown-ups won't help us!"
Bluey: "Well, then we need more kids!"
Bluey hops off of the seesaw to go around the park to find more kids to help with the seesaw. The shot cuts to Coco playing noughts and crosses on the playground.
Bluey: "Coco, we need your help!"
Coco: "What is it, Bluey?"
Bluey: "We're trying to get my dad off the seesaw!"
Coco: "Oh."
Bluey: "But we're not heavy enough!"
Coco: "Oh."
Bluey: "And he keeps eating sausages!"
Coco: "Oh!"
Bluey: "Is your frizzy hair very heavy?"
Coco: "Uhhh...yeah?"
Bluey: "Good, come on!"
The shot cuts back to the seesaw.
Bluey: I brought Coco!"
Bingo: "Hooray!"
As Coco and Bluey sit down, the combined weight of the four manage to cause the seesaw to begin tipping onto their side, lifting Bandit up.
Bandit: "Oop!"
Bluey: "It's working! Coco's frizzy hair is working!"
Bluey, Bingo, Chloe and Coco: "Hooray!"
Bandit reaffirms his position back on the seesaw, causing their efforts to be for nothing.
Bingo: "Ah, it stopped! We're still not heavy enough."
Coco: "I'm sorry!"
Bluey: "It's not your fault, Coco! It's HIS!"
Bluey points at Bandit. As she does so Bandit blows raspberries at her.
Bluey: "We need another kid!"
The shot cuts to Snickers playing on a spring rider.
Snickers: "Giddyup!"
Bluey: "Snickers, we need you!"
Snickers: "But I'm playing on the- Aah!"
Bluey: "Come on!"
Bluey picks Snickers up, running back to the seesaw.
Bluey: "We're gonna fix you up, mate! We've got a sausage dog!"
Bingo: "Bluey, look what he's got!"
Bingo points down to Bandit. He has a rock that is helping weigh him down.
Bandit: "Oh, Rodney my darling! You're so smooth!"
Bingo: "It's a pet rock!"
Bluey: "What!?"
Coco: "He just picked it up from over there!"
Bluey: "Well, don't worry. Snickers is heavier than a pet rock! ...Aren't you?"
Snickers: "I think so."
Bingo: "Come on, Snickers!"
Snickers: "Okay!"
Now with a team of five, the seesaw begins to lift back up again, their combined weights proving to be outweighing Bandit. As he begins to panic he looks for another nearby rock.
Bluey: "We're gonna do it!"
Bandit: "Oh Rodney look, you can have your own pet rock!"
Bluey, Chloe and Coco: "What!?"
Chloe: "His pet rock has a pet rock!"
Bingo: "This is outrageous!"
Bluey: "Get off our seesaw!"
Bluey, Bingo, Chloe, Coco and Snickers: "Yeah!"
Bandit: "Why would I get off MY seesaw?"
He lays down on the seesaw.
Bluey: "What are we gonna do!?"
Bingo: "We've run out of kids!"
The shot shows the empty playground, and then back to the seesaw, showing the discouraged and defeated team. As all hope seems lost, Bluey smiles and has one final idea.
Bluey: "Oh no we haven't!"
The shot cuts to Pom Pom's Mum and Chilli talking. Pom Pom has been sitting on her mum's lap the entire time.
Pom Pom's Mum: "And how is your dad going?:"
Bluey, Bingo, Chloe, Coco and Snickers: "POM POM! Over here!"
Chilli:: Some good, some bad. He's just had heartworm, so we're gonna see him next week.
They catch the attention of Pom Pom, who perks up to look at the seesaw.
Pom Pom smiles and runs to the seesaw, giving her mum and Chilli a smile.
Pom Pom: "Okay, I'm coming!"
The Pups: "We need you!"
Pom Pom: "I'm here!"
Bluey: "Pom Pom, get up here, quick!"
Pom Pom: "Okay!"
Pom Pom looks up. It's a long way up for the small Pomeranian.
Pom Pom: "Goodness me!"
Pom Pom struggles to get up to the seesaw, managing to pull herself up.
Pom Pom: "I'm up!"
Bluey: "Yeah! That's it, that's it!"
Pom Pom: "Here I come!"
Coco: "It's working!"
Bluey: "That's it, Pom Pom! Keep going!"
At long last it seems their final effort will prove to be their victory. Just then, they catch Bandit's attention once more.
Bandit: "Huh? Hey, what's going on?"
Bandit reaffirms his position sitting on the seesaw. As he does he causes Pom Pom to lose her footing, causing her to slowly slide down the seesaw.
Pom Pom: "Eeeeee!-
The Pups: "Pom Pom!"
Bandit: "Come here, you!"
Pom Pom manages to catch herself before she falls close enough to Bandit's grip.
The Pups: "POM POM!"
Pom Pom: "Ooh, that was close!"
Bluey: "Come on Pom Pom, climb back up!"
Pom Pom: "Okay!"
The Pups cheer for Pom Pom as she begins crawling her way back up, causing the seesaw to tip in their favor.
Bandit: "Whoa- Hey- Stop it!"
Bingo: "You can do it, Pom Pom!"
Pom Pom's tail wags as she jumps into Bluey's paws. At long last, victory is theirs, as the seesaw finally weighted in the kids' favor.
Bandit: "WHOA!"
The Pups: "Hooray!"
Pom Pom: "I DID IT!"
Bandit: "Help! I don't like it up here!"
Bingo: "Take that, you big meanie!"
The Pups: "Yay!"
Bingo: "This is our seesaw!"
Bandit: "I demand you let me down this instant!"
Bingo: "Oh, okay! We'll get off..."
Bluey: "Ready?"
Chloe, Coco, Snickers and Pom Pom: "Ready!"
Bandit: "Wait, hang on--"
Bluey: "Now!"
The Pups get off of the seesaw. As they do so Bandit is sent to the ground at a high speed, causing him to roll off.
Bingo: "Get him!"
The Pups all playfully fight him, with the pups scratching his fur. He gets up, with Pom Pom clinging to his legs and the pups chasing after him.
Bandit: "No, no!"
The shot transitions to later in the day, towards the evening. Bluey, Judo and Pom Pom are now playing Flies and Spiders. The three run around the climbing net with Bingo in the center. Bluey manages to get stuck, catching Bingo's attention.
Bingo: "Here comes Mrs. Spider!"
Bluey : "Oh no!"
Bluey buzzes, panicking and thrashes around, before Bingo comes over to catch her. Right before however, Bluey manages to break herself free from the net.
Bluey : "I'm free!"
Bingo : "Oh, you cheeky fly!"
Pom Pom runs up to Bingo.
Pom Pom: "Can I have a go at being the spider, Bingo?"
Bingo: "Sure, Pom Pom!"
Judo: "You're too small to be the spider!"
Pom Pom: "No I'm not!"
Bluey: "Yeah, no she's not!"
Bluey helps Pom Pom up onto the net.
Bluey: "Pomeranians are a small, but hardy breed."
Pom Pom and Bluey laugh.
