The episode opens with a view of a park.
Bandit is sitting on a picnic blanket accompanied by and having a conversation with Pom Pom's Mum.
Pom Pom's Mum: (to Bandit) "Oh I know."
Bluey and Pom Pom are hanging on the barrier rail of the park driveway with Chilli and Bingo behind them.
Camera moves focus over to Chilli and the pups.
Chilli: "Okay, just one last bit of washing to hang out..."
Chilli picks up Bingo and places her on the bar.
Chilli: "...And, there! 
Chilli sights of exhaustive relief.
Chilli: All my washing is hung out. Now, to relax..."
With Chilli's back turned, Bluey and Bingo suddenly drop from the bar, cheering as they alert Chilli. A surprised Pom Pom is left hanging on the bar alone.
Chilli: "Oh no! The wind's blowing my washing off the line! I have to get it back!"
Chilli chases after Bingo and Bluey. She manages to grab Bingo, much to her joy.
(offscreen) Pom Pom: "Missus Heeler!"
The shot cuts back to Pom Pom still hanging down on the bar. She is nervously looking down at the ground which is really far away.
Chilli runs to and picks Pom Pom into the safety.
Chilli: "Oh, sorry, Pom Pom! It's a long way down for you, isn't it?"
Pom Pom: "Yes, Missus Heeler. Pomeranians are a small breed!"
Chilli: "There you go."
Chilli smiles and puts Pom Pom down on the ground.
Chilli: "Now to get my washing back!"
Pom Pom: "Whee!"
Pom Pom happily runs around as the game picks back up again.
Bingo: Come back here, pillowcase!
Chilli picks up Bluey.
(offscreen) Pom Pom: "Aarrh, Missus Heeler!"
The shot cuts to Pom Pom struggling to make a small climb up the ledge to join the game.
Pom Pom: "I can't do it! Maybe it's best if I don't play washing."
Pom Pom runs off, much to the dismay of Bluey and Bingo.
Bluey, Bingo: "Pom Pom!"
The shot cuts to Bandit and Pom Pom's Mum talking.
Bandit: "Well I'm still an enthusiast, I go along you know... have a go at it."
Pom Pom runs to sit in her mother's lap, whimpering as her mum comforts her. 
 The shot goes back to Bluey, Bingo and Chilli.
Chilli: "Oh, poor Pom Pom."
Bingo notices something offscreen and with a smile runs off.
Bluey: "Well, she is a bit small for this game."
Chilli: "There's nothing wrong with being small, honey."
Bingo: "Hey, Bluey!"
Bingo is now sitting on one side of the nearby seesaw.
Bingo: "Let's play seesaw!"
Bluey: "Yeah!"
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Seesaw."
Bluey and Bingo are now playing on the seesaw.
Bluey, Bingo: "Seesaw, Margery Daw..."
The two continue to sing in background.
The shot cuts to Pom Pom's Mum, Chilli, and Bandit talking.
Bandit looks down to see Pom Pom being very melancholic in her mum's arms.
Pom Pom's Mum: "Oh, I hope they bring him back for season four."
Chilli: "Yeah, they do! Haven't you seen the trailer?"
Pom Pom's Mum: "No. What trailer?"
Bandit looks to the Heeler sisters, and gets an idea. He gets up and walks over to the seesaw.
Chilli: "He's in Russia or something."
Pom Pom's Mum: "Oh, brilliant."
Chilli: Yeah, it's going to be...
Chilli and Pom Pom's Mum's discussion fades out.
Bandit arrives to the seesaw just as the pups have finished their song.
With a swift swoop, Bandit spins Bingo off from her spot on the seesaw.
Bingo: "Whoa! (giggling) Hey!" 
Bandit: "This is mine."
Bandit takes the spot on the seesaw Bingo used to occupy.
Bluey: "Hey, get off!"
Bingo: "Yeah, get off! We were on that!"
Bandit: "Not anymore."
Bluey slides down into Bandit.
Bluey: "Come on Bingo, help me!"
Bluey and Bingo attempt to push and stomp Bandit off, but to no avail.
Bandit: "Oooh, a massage! Why, thank you! Yeah, a little lower. Ooh, that's the spot!" 
Bingo: "Grab his arms!"
Bluey pulls Bandit's arm and tries to pull him, while Bingo continues to jump into his back.
Bandit: "Oh yeah! Thai style. Oh, that feels good!"
Bingo and Bluey give up trying to force him off.
Bingo: "Get off, you big blue meanie!"
Bandit: "Nah!"
Bluey: "I've got an idea. Come on, Bingo! We'll seesaw him off!"
Bingo: "Oh yeah!"
Bluey and Bingo attempt to force the seesaw down to get Bandit off who moves a nill.
Bingo: "We're not heavy enough!"
Bandit: "Yeah. I'm pretty huge."
Just then, a giggling Chloe enters the scene while soccer-dribbling a pine cone.
Bluey: "Hey Chloe! Come up here and help us seesaw Dad off!"
Chloe: "Ooh, okay!"
Chloe makes her way up the seesaw.
Bluey: "Hoo-hoo, we're gonna more heavy you off now, big daddy!"
Bandit: (teasingly) "Oooh, I'm so scared!"
Bluey: "Okay, sit down Chloe!"
Chloe sits down; no dice.
Bingo: "We're still not heavy enough!"
Bluey: "He must weigh the same as a hippo!"
Bandit lightly sits up smirking, causing the seesaw to shift and the trio of pups to bounce upwards.
Bluey: "That's it, I'm calling Mum!"
Bandit: "Oh yeah, run to your momma."
Bluey: "Muuuuum!"
Bingo: "She'll sort you out, mate!"
Chilli enters, carrying two sausage sizzles.
Chilli: "Hello!"
Bluey: "Mum, dad's sitting on the seesaw and he won't get off!"
Chilli: "Oh, boo-hoo!"
The pup-trio gasps, taken aback by Chilli's unexpected response.
Bluey: "What?!"
Chilli: "Here you are, my darling!"
Chilli hands the sausages in bread to Bandit.
Bandit: "Oh, thank you my precious!"
Bandit proceeds to devour the snags.
Bluey: "Mum, what are you doing?!"
Bingo: "Don't feed him!"
Bluey: "You're making him even more heavy!"
Bandit rubs his belly. 
Bandit: "Mmm, so filling!"
Chilli: "Have fun, children!"
Chilli walks away from the scene.
Bingo: "This is outrageous!"
Chloe: "The grownups won't help us!"
Bluey: "Well, then, we need more kids!"
Bluey drops off of the seesaw to find more kids. 
The shot cuts to Coco playing noughts and crosses on the playground.
Coco: "Spin!"
Bluey runs into frame.
Bluey: "Coco, we need your help!"
Coco: "What is it, Bluey?"
Bluey: "We're trying to get my dad off the seesaw!"
Coco: "Oh."
Bluey: "But we're not heavy enough!"
Coco: "Oh!"
Bluey: "And he keeps eating sausages!"
Coco: "Oh!!"
Bluey: "Is your frizzy hair very heavy?"
Coco: "Umm...yeah?"
Bluey: "Good, come on!"
The shot cuts back to the seesaw.
Bluey: I brought Coco!"
Bingo: "Hurray!"
As Coco and Bluey sit down, the combined weight of the four pups manage to cause the seesaw to begin tipping onto their side.
 Bandit soon noticed he is about to lose his footing.
Bandit: "...Whoop."
Bluey: "It's working! Coco's frizzy hair is working!"
Bluey, Bingo, Chloe and Coco: "Hurray!"
But then Bandit transfers rest of his body weight onto his bottom thus sitting down more firmly to cut short the celebration of the pups.
Bingo: "Ah, it stopped! We're still not heavy enough."
Coco: "I'm sorry!"
Bluey: "It's not your fault, Coco! It's HIS!"
Bluey points at Bandit.
Bandit blows raspberries back at her.
Bluey: "Ooh! We need another kid!"
The shot cuts to Snickers playing on a pelican spring rider.
Snickers: "Whoa-whoa, giddyup!"
Bluey runs into the frame.
Bluey: "Snickers, we need you!"
Snickers: "But I'm playing on the- "
Bluey snatches Snickers off the ride-
Snicker: "-Aah!"
- and underarm carries him off the screen. 
Bluey: (grunts) "Come, on!"
Cut back to the seesaw to which Bluey arrives with Snickers.
Bluey: "Oh-ho-ho, we gonna fix you up, mate!
Bluey sits Snickers down.
Bluey: We've got a sausage dog!"
Bingo: "Bluey, look what he's got!"
Bingo points down to Bandit who now has a rock helping weigh him down.
Bandit: "Oh, Rodney my darling! You're so smooth!"
Bingo: "It's a pet rock!"
Bluey: "What!?"
Coco: "He just picked it up from over there!"
Bluey: "Well, don't worry. Snickers is heavier than a pet rock!...Aren't you?"
Snickers: "I think so."
Bingo: "Come on, Snickers!"
Snickers: "Okay!"
Now with a team of five, the seesaw begins to lift back up again, their combined weights proving to be outweighing Bandit.
As Bandit is soon to once again lose his footing.
Bluey: "We're gonna do it! We're gonna do it!"
But then...
Bandit: "Oh Rodney look, you can have your own pet rock!"
...Bandit picks up rock to accompany his previous rock, with the total weight once more being greater than of the pups.
Bluey, Chloe and Coco: "What!?"
Chloe: "His pet rock has a pet rock!"
Bingo: "This is outrageous!"
Bluey: "Get off our seesaw!"
Bluey, Bingo, Chloe, Coco, Snickers: "Yeah!"
Bandit: "Why would I get off my seesaw?"
He lays down on the seesaw.
Bluey: "What are we gonna do!?"
Bingo: "We've run out of kids!"
The shot shows the empty playground, and then back to the seesaw, showing the discouraged and defeated team. As all hope seems lost, Bluey smiles and has one final idea.
Bluey: "Oh no, we haven't!"
The shot cuts to Pom Pom's Mum and Chilli talking. Pom Pom has been sitting on her mum's lap the entire time.
Pom Pom's Mum: "And how is your dad going?"
Frame gets filled with close-up on Pom Pom.
(offscreen) Bluey, Bingo, Chloe, Coco and Snickers: "POM POM! 
They catch the attention of Pom Pom, who perks up to look at the direction of the seesaw. 
(offscreen) Chilli: "Oh, well Dad's being Dad: He just had a heartworm actually..."
A view from behind Pom Pom seeing the overloaded seesaw.
Chloe and Coco: "Over here!"
Chilli: "...so we're gonna see him next week."
Pom Pom jumps off her mum's lap and runs to the seesaw, giving her mum and Chilli a smile.
Pom Pom: "Okay, I'm coming!"
Cut to overhead-view seeing Pom Pom running towards the seesaw.
Coco': "Come here, Pom Pom!" (overlapping) Chloe: "We need you!" 
Pom Pom arrives to the seesaw.
Pom Pom: "I'm here!"
Bluey: "Pom Pom, get up here, quick!"
Pom Pom: "Okay!"
Pom Pom looks up; it's a long way up for the tiny teacup-sized Pomeranian pup.
Pom Pom: "Goodness me!"
Pom Pom after some struggles, manages to pull herself up on the seesaw.
Pom Pom: "I'm up!"
Team Pups: "Yeah!"
Bluey: "That's it, that's it!"
Pom Pom: "Here I come!"
Coco: "It's working!"
Bluey: "That's it, Pom Pom! Keep going!"
At long last it seems their final effort will prove to be their victory. Just then, they catch Bandit's attention once more.
Bandit: "Huh? Hey, what's going on?"
Bandit reaffirms his position sitting on the seesaw. As he does he causes Pom Pom to lose her footing, causing her to slowly slide and roll down the seesaw.
Pom Pom: "Eeeeee!-
The Pups: "Pom Pom!"
Bandit: "Come here, you!"
Pom Pom manages to catch herself before she falls close enough to Bandit's grasp.
The Pups: "POM POM!"
Pom Pom: "Whew, that was close!"
Bluey: "Come on Pom Pom, climb back up!"
Pom Pom: "Okay!"
The Pups cheer for Pom Pom as she begins crawling her way back up, causing the seesaw to tip in their favor.
Bluey: "Keep going!
(overlaid) Bingo: "You're almost there!"
(overlaid) Coco: "That's it!"
Pom Pom: "Pomeranians are a small, but hardy breed!"
Bingo: "Come on, come on!"
Coco: "It's working!"
Bandit's feet are no longer touching the ground.
Bandit: "Whoa-aaa! Stop it!"
Bluey: "Keep going!"
Bingo: "You can do it, Pom Pom!"
Pom Pom's tail wags as she jumps into Bluey's paws.
The seesaw side of the pups plummets with a great speed.
Bluey: Whoo!!!
Having already dropped his pet rocks further away, Bandit hangs on tightly on to the seesaw-board to avoid being flung into air.
Bandit: "WhooOOAAAAA!"
At long last, victory belongs to the pups, as the seesaw has finally weighted down in their favour.
The Pups: "YAY!"
Pom Pom: "I DID IT!"
Bandit: "Help! I don't like it up here!"
Bingo: "Take that, you big meanie!"
The Pups: "YEAH!!!"
Bingo: "This is our seesaw!"
Bandit: "I demand you let me down this instant!"
Bingo: "Oh, okay! We'll get off..."
Bluey: "Ready?"
Chloe, Coco, Snickers and Pom Pom: "Ready!"
Bandit: "Wait, hang on--"
The Pups: "Go!"
The Pups get off of the seesaw. As they do so Bandit is sent to the ground at a high speed, causing him to roll off the blank.
Bingo: "Get him!"
The Pups all playfully fight him, with the pups scratching his fur. He gets up, with Pom Pom clinging to his legs and the pups chasing after him.
Bandit: "No, no! (rabbling) I'm sorry- I'm sorry again!!!"
The shot transitions to later in the day, towards the dusk.
The pups are playing "Flies and Spiders": Bluey, Judo and Pom Pom are run-buzzing around the climbing net with Bingo in the center as a spider. Bluey manages to get stuck, catching Bingo's attention.
Bingo : "Here comes Mrs. Spider!"
Bluey : (in a squeaky voice) "Oh no!"
Bluey buzzes, panicking and thrashes around, before Bingo comes over to catch her. Right before however, Bluey manages to break herself free from the net.
Bluey: "I'm free!"
Bingo: "Oh, you cheeky fly!"
Pom Pom runs up to Bingo.
Pom Pom: "Can I have a go at being the spider, Bingo?"
Bingo: "Sure, Pom Pom!"
Judo: "You're too small to be the spider!"
Pom Pom: "No I'm not!"
Bluey: "Yeah, no she's not!"
Bluey helps Pom Pom up onto the net.
Bluey: "Pomeranians are a small, but hardy breed."
Pom Pom and Bluey giggle.
