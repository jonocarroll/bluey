TITLE CARD: TEA PARTY
An establishing shot shows the Heeler house.
Cut to the deck next to the bedroom of the Heeler-pups where Honey and Bluey are having a tea party on the floor.
Honey's parents enter the scene from the bedroom.
Marcus: Okay Honey; shall we go home now?
Honey: Umm, no...Let's play!
Daisy: Alright, just for little bit.
Marcus and Daisy take a seat next to the table-set modelled after fly agaric .
Bluey: This is a tea party; would you like a cup of tea while you wait?
Marcus: Oh yes please, Bluey, that would be lovely. I am a bit parched as it happens.
Daisy: (offhand) Don't ask him if we wants sugar.
Marcus: Three sugars for me!
After a small giggle, the pups set their tea-set on the table and ran back to their previous spot.
Bluey: Here you go!
Honey now carrying the teapot walk towards the table.
Daisy: I hope you warmed the pot; your dad likes it nice and hot.
After more giggles, Honey turns back to Bluey who pattycakes the teapot to warm it up.
Honey then once again approaches the table and begins to pour for Marcus.
Marcus: And make sure you leave the tea to stew for at least two minutes.
Honey finishes pouring and returns next to Bluey.
Daisy: It's not stew, it's brew. And it should be for three minutes.
The pups giggle once more. Bluey runs to the left side of Marcus to offer milk.
Bluey: Would you like milk with your tea?-Yes of course you would.
Bluey starts pouring the milk.
Marcus: Wait a minute: Did you put the milk in first?
Honey: (nervously) Umm...no.
Marcus: You must always put the milk in before the tea.
Honey: Oh!
Honey runs to Marcus, takes his teacup and empties it away from the table, and then returns the cup on the saucer. 
Honey: Okay.
Marcus: Milk before tea is best for me.
Honey pours tea for Marcus again once Bluey has poured-in the milk. 
Marcus: (offhand) And can I have a biscuit on the side; I like to dunk a nice biscuit. 
The pups return to their spot; Bluey holding a memo-pad and writing down Marcus' order.
Marcus: A wafer would be nice.
Daisy: (shocked) You can't dunk a wafer; it'll go all soggy! 
Daisy clicks her tongue while rolling her eyes.
Daisy: Don't be so silly, Marcus.
Marcus: Well I like a wafer; I like the way they go all soggy.
Daisy: (smirking) Ewwww!
The pups chuckle while side-eyeing.
Daisy: Oh Marcus. It needs to be a ginger nut; they're much stronger and they hold the tea better. Or an Anzac biscuit; they work well dunked.
Daisy looks at the pups.
Daisy: I'll just have a cup of tea and a piece of cake.
Marcus: Sounds great!
Honey and Bluey; YEAH!!!
