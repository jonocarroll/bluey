Bingo runs along the edge of a swimming pool in a tropical resort. She holds a yellow flowered swim cap in one hand.
Bingo: "I don't need floaties 'cause I learned to swim!"
She approaches Chilli and Bandit, reclining on lounge chairs under a fancy umbrella. Chilli is reading a Bali guidebook.
Bandit: "Bingo, walking. Walking!"
Bingo slows to a stop.
Bingo: "Sorry."
Bandit: "Running's a bit dangerous by the pool, mate."
Bluey runs up behind Bingo, carrying a watermelon-pattern swim cap and crab goggles.
Bluey: "Let's play swim school!"
Bingo: "Dad, Bluey's running by the pool."
Bandit: "Bingo, don't be a dobber."
Chilli gets a squirt of sunscreen and starts applying it to Bingo's face and arms.
Bingo: "What?! But you said running by the pool is dangerous."
Bandit: "Well, yeah. It is."
Chilli moves on to apply sunscreen to Bluey.
Bingo: "So, what if Bluey's doing something dangerous? Should I dob then?"
Chilli, finished applying sunscreen to the kids, sits back down in the lounge chair and starts reading her guidebook again.
Bandit: "Well, yeah but, um... Chilli?"
Chilli doesn't look up from her book.
Chilli: (indicating "I dunno") "Mn-hmm-n."
Bandit: "Uh, gotta go!"
Bandit rolls off the side of his lounge chair into the pool.
TITLE CARD - Swim School
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called: Swim School."
Bluey, Bingo, and Bandit are swimming in the pool. Bingo hands Bluey the yellow swim cap.
Bluey: "So there's two classes: Little Fish and Big Fish."
Chilli swims up and hangs on Bandit's back.
Chilli: "Can I play?"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bluey: "You have to pass Little Fish before you can go to Big Fish. Got it?"
Bingo, Bandit, Chilli: "Got it!"
Bluey: "Okay, children, time to meet your teacher."
Bluey ducks underwater. She surfaces a moment later, wearing the yellow flowered swim cap.
Bluey: (poshly) "Hello, darlings. I'm Karen."
Bingo, Bandit, Chilli: "Hi, Karen."
Bluey: (normally) "Oh, and you're all brothers and sisters."
Bandit and Chilli recoil from each other.
Bandit, Chilli: "Bleagh!"
Bluey: "Let's do kicking."
A moment later, Bingo, Chilli, and Bandit are hanging on to the side of the pool, practicing kicking. Bluey stands on the side of the pool.
Bluey: "Good kicking, Bingo."
She pats Bingo's head.
Bingo: "No, no, my name's Meryfindor."
Bluey: "Good kicking, Meryfindor."
She pats Meryfindor's head. The camera pans over, showing Bandit making slow, splashy kicks.
Bandit: ♫ "Doot, da doot, da doot, da door, da daa..." ♫
Chilli raises her hand.
"Karen, Bevan isn't doing it properly!"
Bandit stops kicking.
Bandit: "Bevan?!"
Bluey: "Is Bevan doing anything dangerous?"
Chilli: "Well, no."
Bluey pats Chilli on the head.
Bluey: "Then don't be a dobber, sweetie."
Chilli: (chastened) "Sorry, Karen."
Bluey: "That's okay."
Bandit resumes his slow kicks.
Bandit: ♫ "Doot, da doot, da doot, da daa..." ♫
Bingo dives underwater holding her breath and pokes Bandit's stomach.
Bandit: "Ooh!"
Bingo surfaces, giggling. She resumes doing her kicks.
Bandit: "Karen, Meryfindor just poked me!"
Bluey: "Hands to yourself, please, young lady."
Bingo: "Yes, Karen."
Chilli: "Hang on, shouldn't Bevan get in trouble for dobbing like I did?"
Bluey: "Oh yes. Bevan, no dobbing."
Bandit: "Well, shouldn't Sharon get in trouble for dobbing on me about dobbing on Meryfindor?"
Bluey: "Oh yes. Bad, Sharon. No dobbing."
Chilli: "But I—ooh!"
Bingo surfaces again, giggling.
Bluey: "Okay, class, two new rules. First, no more poking."
Bingo: "Aw."
Bluey: "And, second, no more dobbing!"
Chilli: "Unless someone's in danger."
Bluey: "Unless that." (sweetly) "You are a family."
Bandit: "You're right, Karen. Let's work together, brothers and sisters."
Chilli, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bluey: (poshly) "And doggy paddle!"
A moment later, the swim class is doggy-paddling across the pool.
Chilli: "You're doing well, brother."
Bandit: "Thanks, sister."
Bingo: "How am I doing?"
Bandit: "Great, little sis. Keep going."
Bluey watches, sitting on the edge of the pool. She has a fancy drink in a coconut.
Bluey: (poshly) "Very good, poppets. Oh, you make Karen so proud."
A moment later, the class pulls themselves along the edge of the pool with their hands.
Bluey: "Excellent monkeying. Oh, you'll be big fish in no time."
Bingo loses her grip.
Bingo: "Aah!"
She submerges.
A moment later, the class has gathered on the edge of the pool.
Bluey: (poshly) "This is your final lesson." (aggressively) "Ninja kicks. Hi-ya!"
She performs a side kick, jumping into the pool.
Bluey, Chilli, and Bingo: "Oh, wow."
She holds her breath underwater, blowing bubbles, and she surfaces.
Bluey: "Tada!"
Bandit, Chilli, and Bingo applaud politely.
Bluey: "Off you go."
Bingo: "Hi-yah!"
Bingo jumps in.
Chilli: "Ya!"
Chilli jumps in.
Bandit: "Hi-ya!"
Bandit jumps in. They all surface next to Bluey.
Bluey: "Well done, poppets. You all get to move up to Big Fish."
Bandit, Chilli, Bingo: "Hooray!"
Bingo: "And no one dobbed on anyone."
Bluey: "Good luck."
Bluey doggy-paddles away.
Chilli: "Wait, are you not our teacher for Big Fish?"
Bluey has reached the edge of the pool, and picks up the watermelon swim cap and crab goggles.
Bluey: "Oh, no, Margaret takes Big Fish. Goodbye."
Bluey ducks under water.
Bandit: "I have a feeling we're not gonna like Margaret."
Bluey pops up behind them, wearing the watermelon swim cap and crab goggles, which are full of water.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Surprise!"
Bandit, Chilli, Bingo: "Aah!"
Bluey: (shrilly) "Welcome to Big Fish. I'm Margaret..."
She lifts her goggles, letting the water out.
Bluey: "...your teacher."
Bandit, Chilli, Bingo: "Hello, Margaret."
Bluey: (shrilly) "Now, I'm not as nice as Karen."
Bandit: "...I knew it."
Bluey: (shrilly) "If anyone steps out of line in my class, you'll get one 'a these."
She sucks up a mouthful of water and spits it in Bandit's face.
Bandit: "Bleh! Blech!"
Bluey: (shrilly) "That's called a squirty."
Bandit: "Why did you demonstrate on me?"
Chilli: "Don't worry about us, Margaret. Karen taught us to work as a family and never to dob..."
Chilli: (quickly) ...unless it's about something dangerous.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Oh yes, Karen doesn't like dobbing, does she?"
Bingo: "No."
Bluey: (shrilly) "Well, I do."
Bandit, Chilli, Bingo: "Huh?"
Bluey: (shrilly) "In fact, if you don't dob, you won't pass."
Bingo: "But I thought dobbing was bad."
Chilli: (quickly) "Unless you're doing something dangerous."
Bluey: (shrilly) "No! dobbing is good."
Chilli: "Well, we're going to pass Big Fish without dobbing."
Bluey: (shrilly) "Big Fish is pretty hard."
Bingo: "We don't care how hard it is."
Bandit: "Yeah, Marge, what do you think about that?"
Bluey spits water in Bandit's face.
Bluey: "Bleh!"
Bluey claps for emphasis.
Bluey: (even shriller) "It's Margaret!"
Later, Chilli, and Bingo watch Bandit do the backstroke. Bluey watches from the edge of the pool.
Chilli: "Great backstroke, Bevan."
Bandit: "Thanks, sis."
As he passes, Bluey hops onto Bandit's stomach.
Bluey: "Whoop!"
She crosses her legs primly.
Bandit: "Whoa, what are you doing?"
Bluey: (shrilly) "I'm a bag of coconuts."
Bandit: (straining) "Why would I—"
Bandit coughs on a mouthful of water.
Bandit: (straining) "—backstroke with a bag coconuts?"
Bluey: (shrilly) "You might be shipwrecked on an island."
Bandit: "Waah—"
Bandit sinks.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Fail."
Later, Bandit and Bingo watch Chilli, hanging on the side of the pool. Bluey is in the water next to her.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Okay, swim to the other side."
Bingo, Bandit: "Go, Sharon!"
Chilli starts to swim with the front crawl. Bluey gets on her back.
Bluey: (shrilly) "I'll just tag along."
Chilli: "What? Ulb, blub."
Chilli sinks.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Fail."
Bingo, Bandit: "What?!"
Later, Bingo is floating on her back, arms outstretched.
Bandit: "Great starfish, Meryfindor."
Bluey: (shrilly) "Here comes a cyclone."
She blows on the top of Bingo's head. Bingo laughs and flails her arms, and promptly sinks.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Another fail."
Chilli: (gruffly) "Family meeting."
Bingo, Chilli, and Bandit huddle up. To give them privacy, Bluey turns upside down, with her legs out of the water, and spins around.
Chilli: "Big Fish is impossible."
Bandit: "Yeah, I don't know about this Margaret character."
Bingo: "She's a silly old... watermelon head."
Chilli: "Yeah."
Bandit: "I want Karen back."
Chilli: "What if we just refuse to do what she says?"
Bingo ducks underwater.
Bandit: "Yeah! If we stick together, what's she gonna do? What do you reckon, Meryfindor? Meryfindor?"
Cut to Bingo, dobbing to Bluey.
Bingo: "And then they said they weren't going to do anything you say, and that they want Karen back."
Bluey pats Bingo's head.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Excellent dobbing, sweetheart."
Bluey spits water in Chilli and Bandit's faces.
Chilli: "Ugh!"
Bandit: "Bleh!"
Bluey: (shrilly) "That's for being cheeky."
Bandit: "Meryfindor! Did you dob on us?"
Bingo laughs.
Bingo: "It's allowed."
Bluey: (shrilly) "It sure is. You just passed Big Fish."
Chilli, Bandit: "What?!"
Chilli points at Bingo.
Chilli: "Okay, well, she called you a silly old watermelon head."
Bluey: "You what?! You fail, too."
She spits water in Bingo's face.
Bingo: "Uagh."
Bingo giggles. Bluey pushes her over by Bandit. Chilli comes to join her instead.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Sharon, come here. You pass Big Fish instead."
Bandit: "But, uh, uh, Sharon peeked in Marco Polo."
Bluey: (shrilly) "What?!"
Chilli: "I did not!"
Bluey spits water in Chilli's face.
Chilli: "Bleh!"
Bluey: (shrilly) "Fail."
Chilli goes over to Bingo. Bandit goes over by Bluey.
Bandit: "Ah, I'll just saunter over here, then."
Chilli: "Well, Bevan, um, um..."
Bluey: "I'll just get ready for a squirty."
She takes a mouthful of water.
Chilli: "Um..."
Bandit: "Go on. You got nothin' on me, Sharon."
Chilli: "He... he... he peed in the pool!"
Bluey spits out her mouthful of water.
Bluey and Bingo shriek.
Chilli: "Ew, ew, gross!"
Bluey, Chilli, and Bingo all climb out and look at the pool water, horrified. They quickly climb out. Bandit shrugs.
Bandit: "It's a victimless crime."
Bluey: (shrilly) "You two pass Big Fish."
Chili, Bingo: "Yes!"
Bluey: (shrilly) "You fail, you big grub."
Bandit: "Aw."
After a moment, Bingo's face falls.
Bingo: "Margaret, I don't like dobbing on my family. If Bevan fails Big Fish, then I want to fail, too."
She does a side kick, rejoining Bandit in the pool.
Bingo: "Hiya!"
She surfaces next to Bandit, who pulls her close in a side hug.
Chilli: "I'm with Meryfindor. Ya!"
She jumps into the pool with a side kick. Bingo giggles. Chilli surfaces next to them, and they both hug Bingo.
Chilli, Bandit: "Good one, sis."
Bluey: (shrilly) "Well, fine. You all fail."
Bluey does a cannonball dive into the pool.
Bandit: "Thanks, Meryfindor."
Bingo: "You're welcome, Bevan."
Bluey resurfaces, wearing the yellow flower swim cap.
Bluey: "Surprise."
Bandit, Bingo, Chilli: "Aah! Karen!"
Bluey: "Welcome back to Little Fish."
They all come together for a group hug.
All: "Aww."
Bluey: "I'm so proud of you all."
Bingo: "Why is the water warmer here?"
Chilli: "Ugh, Bevan!"
Bluey screams and the girls scatter. Bandit smiles sheepishly.
The episode music, a cheerful string waltz, plays as Bluey dances during the credits.
