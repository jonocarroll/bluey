Bingo runs along the edge of a swimming pool in a tropical resort. She holds a yellow flowered swim cap in one hand.
Bingo: "I don't need floaties 'cause I learned to swim!"
She approaches Chilli and Bandit, reclining on lounge chairs under a fancy umbrella. Chilli is reading a Bali guidebook.
Bandit: "Bingo, walking. Walking!"
Bingo slows to a stop.
Bingo: "Sorry."
Bandit: "Running's a bit dangerous by the pool, mate."
Bluey runs up behind Bingo, carrying a watermelon-pattern swim cap and crab goggles.
Bluey: "Let's play swim school!"
Bingo: "Dad, Bluey's running by the pool."
Bandit: "Bingo, don't be a dobber."
Chilli gets a squirt of sunscreen and starts applying it to Bingo's face and arms.
Bingo: "What?! But you said running by the pool is dangerous."
Bandit: "Well, yeah. It is."
Chilli moves on to apply sunscreen to Bluey.
Bingo: "So, what if Bluey's doing something dangerous? Should I dob then?"
Chilli, finished applying sunscreen to the kids, sits back down in the lounge chair and starts reading her guidebook again.
Bandit: "Well, yeah but, um... Chilli?"
Chilli doesn't look up from her book.
Chilli: (indicating "I dunno") "Mn-hmm-n."
Bandit: "Uh, gotta go!"
Bandit rolls off the side of his lounge chair into the pool.
TITLE CARD - Swim School
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called: Swim School."
Bluey, Bingo, and Bandit are swimming in the pool. Bingo hands Bluey the yellow swim cap.
Bluey: "So there's two classes: Little Fish and Big Fish."
Chilli swims up and hangs on Bandit's back.
Chilli: "Can I play?"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bluey: "You have to pass Little Fish before you can go to Big Fish. Got it?"
Bingo, Bandit, Chilli: "Got it!"
Bluey: "Okay, children, time to meet your teacher."
Bluey ducks underwater. She surfaces a moment later, wearing the yellow flowered swim cap.
Bluey: (poshly) "Hello, darlings. I'm Karen."
Bingo, Bandit, Chilli: "Hi, Karen."
Bluey: (normally) "Oh, and you're all brothers and sisters."
Bandit and Chilli recoil from each other.
Bandit, Chilli: "Bleagh!"
Bluey: "Let's do kicking."
A moment later, Bingo, Chilli, and Bandit are hanging on to the side of the pool, practicing kicking. Bluey stands on the side of the pool.
Bluey: "Good kicking, Bingo."
She pats Bingo's head.
Bingo: "No, no, my name's Merryfindor."
Bluey: "Good kicking, Merryfindor."
She pats Merryfindor's head. The camera pans over, showing Bandit making slow, splashy kicks.
Bandit: ♫ "Doot, da doot, da doot, da daa..." ♫
Chilli raises her hand.
"Karen, Bevan isn't doing it properly."
Bandit stops kicking.
Bandit: "Bevan?!"
Bluey: "Is Bevan doing anything dangerous?"
Chilli: "Well, no."
Bluey pats Chilli on the head.
Bluey: "Then don't be a dobber, sweetie."
Chilli: (chastened) "Sorry, Karen."
Bluey: "That's okay."
Bandit resumes his slow kicks.
Bandit: ♫ "Doot, da doot, da doot, da daa..." ♫
Bingo dives underwater holding her breath and pokes Bandit's stomach.
Bandit: "Ooh!"
Bingo surfaces, giggling. She resumes doing her kicks.
Bandit: "Karen, Merryfindor just poked me."
Bluey: "Hands to yourself, please, young lady."
Bingo: "Yes, Karen."
Chilli: "Hang on, shouldn't Bevan get in trouble for dobbing like I did?"
Bluey: "Oh yes. Bevan, no dobbing."
Bandit: "Well, shouldn't Sharon get in trouble for dobbing on me about dobbing on Merryfindor?"
Bluey: "Oh yes. Bad, Sharon. No dobbing."
Chilli: "But I—ooh!"
Bingo surfaces again, giggling.
Bluey: "Okay, class, two new rules. First, no more poking."
Bingo: "Aw."
Bluey: "And, second, no more dobbing."
Chilli: "Unless someone's in danger."
Bluey: "Unless that."
Bluey: (sweetly) "You are a family."
Bandit: "You're right, Karen. Let's work together, brothers and sisters."
Chilli, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bluey: (poshly) "Doggy paddle!"
A moment later, the swim class is doggy-paddling across the pool.
Chilli: "You're doing well, brother."
Bandit: "Thanks, sister."
Bingo: "How am I doing?"
Bandit: "Great, little sis. Keep going."
Bluey watches, sitting on the edge of the pool. She has a fancy drink in a coconut.
Bluey: (poshly) "Very good, poppets. Oh, you make Karen so proud."
A moment later, the class pulls themselves along the edge of the pool with their hands.
Bluey: "Excellent monkeying. Oh, you'll be big fish in no time."
Bingo loses her grip.
Bingo: "Aah!"
She submerges.
A moment later, the class has gathered on the edge of the pool.
Bluey: (poshly) "This is your final lesson."
Bluey: (aggressively) "Ninja kicks. Hi-ya!"
She performs a side kick, jumping into the pool.
Bluey, Chilli, and Bingo: "Oh, wow."
She holds her breath underwater, blowing bubbles, and she surfaces.
Bluey: "Tada!"
Bandit, Chilli, and Bingo applaud politely.
Bluey: "Off you go."
Bingo: "Hi-yaa!"
Bingo jumps in.
Chilli: "Ya!"
Chilli jumps in.
Bandit: "Hi-ya!"
Bandit jumps in. They all surface next to Bluey.
Bluey: "Well done, poppets. You all get to move up to Big Fish."
Bandit, Chilli, Bingo: "Hooray!"
Bingo: "And no one dobbed on anyone."
Bluey: "Good luck."
Bluey doggy-paddles away.
Chilli: "Wait, are you not our teacher for Big Fish?"
Bluey has reached the edge of the pool, and picks up the watermelon swim cap and crab goggles.
Bluey: "Oh, no, Margaret takes Big Fish. Goodbye."
Bluey ducks under water.
Bandit: "I have a feeling we're not gonna like Margaret."
Bluey pops up behind them, wearing the watermelon swim cap and crab goggles, which are full of water.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Surprise!"
Bandit, Chilli, Bingo: "Aah!"
Bluey: (shrilly) "Welcome to Big Fish. I'm Margaret..."
She lifts her goggles, letting the water out.
Bluey: "...your teacher."
Bandit, Chilli, Bingo: "Hello, Margaret."
Bluey: (shrilly) "Now, I'm not as nice as Karen."
Bandit: "...I knew it."
Bluey: (shrilly) "If anyone steps out of line in my class, you'll get one 'a these."
She sucks up a mouthful of water and spits it in Bandit's face.
Bandit: "Bleh! Blech!"
Bluey: (shrilly) "That's called a squirty."
Bandit: "Why did you demonstrate on me?"
Chilli: "Don't worry about us, Margaret. Karen taught us to work as a family and never to dob..."
Chilli: (quickly) ...unless it's about something dangerous.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Oh yes, Karen doesn't like dobbing, does she?"
Bingo: "No."
Bluey: (shrilly) "Well, I do."
Bandit, Chilli, Bingo: "Huh?"
Bluey: (shrilly) "In fact, if you don't dob, you won't pass."
Bingo: "But I thought dobbing was bad."
Chilli: (quickly) "Unless you're doing something dangerous."
Bluey: (shrilly) "No! dobbing is good."
Chilli: "Well, we're going to pass Big Fish without dobbing."
Bluey: (shrilly) "Big Fish is pretty hard."
Bingo: "We don't care how hard it is."
Bandit: "Yeah, Marge, what do you think about that?"
Bluey spits water in Bandit's face.
Bluey: "Bleh!"
Bluey claps for emphasis.
Bluey: (even shriller) "It's Margaret!"
Later, Chilli, and Bingo watch Bandit do the backstroke. Bluey watches from the edge of the pool.
Chilli: "Great backstroke, Bevan."
Bandit: "Thanks, sis."
As he passes, Bluey hops onto Bandit's stomach.
Bluey: "Whoop!"
She crosses her legs primly.
Bandit: "Whoa, what are you doing?"
Bluey: (shrilly) "I'm a bag of coconuts."
Bandit: (straining) "Why would I—"
Bandit coughs on a mouthful of water.
Bandit: (straining) "—backstroke with a bag coconuts?"
Bluey: (shrilly) "You might be shipwrecked on an island."
Bandit: "Waah—"
Bandit sinks.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Fail."
Later, Bandit and Bingo watch Chilli, hanging on the side of the pool. Bluey is in the water next to her.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Okay, swim to the other side."
Bingo, Bandit: "Go, Sharon!"
Chilli starts to swim with the front crawl. Bluey gets on her back.
Bluey: (shrilly) "I'll just tag along."
Chilli: "What? Ulb, blub."
Chilli sinks.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Fail."
Bingo, Bandit: "What?!"
Later, Bingo is floating on her back, arms outstretched.
Bandit: "Great starfish, Merryfindor."
Bluey: (shrilly) "Here comes a cyclone."
She blows on the top of Bingo's head. Bingo laughs and flails her arms, and promptly sinks.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Another fail."
Chilli: (gruffly) "Family meeting."
Bingo, Chilli, and Bandit huddle up. To give them privacy, Bluey turns upside down, with her legs out of the water, and spins around.
Chilli: "Big Fish is impossible."
Bandit: "Yeah, I don't know about this Margaret character."
Bingo: "She's a silly old... watermelon head."
Chilli: "Yeah."
Bandit: "I want Karen back."
Chilli: "What if, we just refuse to do what she says?"
Bingo ducks underwater.
Bandit: "Yeah! If we stick together, what's she gonna do? What do you reckon, Merryfindor? Merryfindor?"
Cut to Bingo, dobbing to Bluey.
Bingo: "And then they said they weren't going to do anything you say, and that they want Karen back."
Bluey pats Bingo's head.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Excellent dobbing, sweetheart."
Bluey spits water in Chilli and Bandit's faces.
Chilli: "Ugh!"
Bandit: "Bleh!"
Bluey: (shrilly) "That's for being cheeky."
Bandit: "Merryfindor! Did you dob on us?"
Bingo laughs.
Bingo: "It's allowed."
Bluey: (shrilly) "It sure is. You just passed Big Fish."
Chilli, Bandit: "What?!"
Chilli points at Bingo.
Chilli: "Okay, well, she called you a silly old watermelon head."
Bluey: "You what?! You fail, too."
She spits water in Bingo's face.
Bingo: "Uagh."
Bingo giggles. Bluey pushes her over by Bandit. Chilli comes to join her instead.
Bluey: (shrilly) "Sharon, come here. You pass Big Fish instead."
Bandit: "But, uh, uh, Sharon peeked in Marco Polo."
Bluey: (shrilly) "What?!"
Chilli: "I did not."
Bluey spits water in Chilli's face.
Chilli: "Bleh!"
Bluey: (shrilly) "Fail."
Chilli goes over to Bingo. Bandit goes over by Bluey.
Bandit: "Ah, I'll just saunter over here, then."
Chilli: "Well, Bevan, uh, um..."
Bluey: "I'll just get ready for a squirty."
She takes a mouthful of water.
Chilli: "Um..."
Bandit: "Go on. You got nothin' on me, Sharon."
Chilli: "He... he... he peed in the pool!"
Bluey spits out her mouthful of water. Bluey, Chilli, and Bingo all shriek and look at the pool water, horrified. They quickly climb out. Bandit shrugs.
Bandit: "It's a victimless crime."
Bluey: (shrilly) "You two pass Big Fish."
Chili, Bingo: "Yes!"
Bluey: (shrilly) "You fail, you big grub."
Bandit: "Aw."
After a moment, Bingo's face falls.
Bingo: "Margaret, I don't like dobbing on my family. If Bevan fails Big Fish, then I want to fail, too."
She does a side kick, rejoining Bandit in the pool.
Bingo: "Hiya!"
She surfaces next to Bandit, who pulls her close in a side hug.
Chilli: "I'm with Merryfindor. Ya!"
She jumps into the pool with a side kick. Bingo giggles. Chilli surfaces next to them, and they both hug Bingo.
Chilli, Bandit: "Good one, sis."
Bluey: (shrilly) "Well, fine. You all fail."
Bluey does a cannonball dive into the pool.
Bandit: "Thanks, Merryfindor."
Bingo: "You're welcome, Bevan."
Bluey resurfaces, wearing the yellow flower swim cap.
Bluey: "Surprise."
Bandit, Bingo, Chilli: "Aah! Karen!"
Bluey: "Welcome back to Little Fish."
They all come together for a group hug.
All: "Aww."
Bluey: "I'm so proud of you all."
Bingo: "Why is the water warmer here?"
Chilli: "Ugh, Bevan!"
The girls scatter. Bandit smiles sheepishly.
The episode music, a cheerful string waltz, plays as Bluey dances during the credits.
