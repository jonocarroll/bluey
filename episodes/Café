The episode opens at a fenced playground, early in the morning. Bandit lounges on a bench. Bluey arranges bark chips on a counter that's built into the play structure. Fido and Winnie enter through the gate. Fido takes a seat on another bench. Winnie walks up to Bluey.
Winnie: "Hello."
Bluey: "Hi. Do you want to play Café?"
Winnie: "Ooh, yes, please."
Bluey gathers the bark chips into a pile.
Bluey: "This can be banana bread."
Winnie picks one up off the ground and adds it to the pile.
Winnie: "Ooh, this one too."
Bluey: "My name's Bluey."
Winnie: "I'm Winnie. Nice to meet you."
Bandit and Fido make eye contact. They nod, each acknowledging the other.
Back at the play structure, Bluey and Winnie arrange the bark chips into piles on the counter.
Winnie: "Have you got any brothers and sisters?"
Bluey: "I've got a sister, Bingo, but she sleeps in. That's why she's not here."
Winnie: "My sister sleeps in too."
Bluey: "Oh."
Winnie: "Ready."
Bluey: "Great! Let's take the customers' orders."
Bluey pantomimes holding an notepad.
Winnie: "What customers?"
Bandit and Fido are looking at their phones.
Bluey, Winnie: "Dad, can you be our customer?"
Bandit and Fido look up from their phones, and make eye contact again.
TITLE CARD - Café
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Café."
Bandit and Fido groan as they wedge themselves into the child-sized seats around a child-sized table.
Bandit: "Hey, mate. Bandit."
Fido: "Fido."
They avoid making eye contact. Winnie walks up, pretending to hold a notepad and pen.
Winnie: "This is the café, and you two are friends. What would you like to order?"
Fido: "I-I'll have a cup of tea, thanks."
Winnie: "Well, we only have banana bread, sorry."
Fido: "Oh, well, I'll have some banana bread. Toasted, please."
Winnie: "Great. And what would you like?"
Fido: (stage whispering) "The banana bread's pretty good."
Bandit: "Banana bread, also toasted."
Winnie: "Okay, two banana breads."
Bandit, Fido: "Toasted!"
Bluey walks out, and sets a bark chip in front of each of them.
Bluey: "Here you go."
Winnie: "That's two dollar bucks. Tap here."
Winnie pretends to hold out a credit card terminal, and Bandit pretends to tap a card.
Bandit: "Boop!"
Winnie: "Sorry, that didn't work."
Bandit: "Oh."
Bluey: "You must be out of money."
Winnie: "Yeah, you spent it all on strawberries."
Bandit: "Oh, yeah, I did."
Fido: "I'll get it. I've got cash."
Fido scoops some leaves off the ground and hands them to Winnie. Winnie counts the leaves into Bluey's hands.
Bandit: "Thanks, mate. I have a strawberry problem."
Winnie: "This isn't enough money. This is only enough for one banana bread."
Bluey confiscates Bandit's bark chip.
Bluey: "You'll have to share."
Bluey and Winnie run off, laughing.
Fido pretends to nibble on the bark chip, then hands it to Bandit, who does the same.
Fido: "They forgot to toast it."
Later, Bluey and Winnie are pretending to cook food and arrange it on the counter. Fido and Bandit are talking.
Bandit: "Yeah, they're just a pain to maintain, that's all."
Fido: "Yeah, true."
Bluey and Winnie run up, holding hands.
Bluey: "Dad, can we go to Winnie's house for breakfast? She invited me."
Bandit: "Oh, ah, no, mate."
Bandit pries his legs out from under the table.
Bandit: "We've got to get home, actually."
Fido extracts his legs from under the table as well.
Fido: "Yeah, we better get back, too."
Bluey: "Okay. Bye, Winnie."
Winnie: "Bye, Bluey."
The hug enthusiastically.
Bluey: "Squeeze me tight. Whoa, that's tight."
Bluey and Winnie continue hugging, picking each other up off the ground in turn. Bandit and Fido shake hands.
Bandit: "Nice to meet you, mate."
Fido: "Yeah, you too."
Later, in the dining room, the Heelers are eating toast for breakfast. Bingo, still sleepy, is having trouble pouring herself a glass of orange juice.
Bluey: "Mum, I made a new friend! Her name's Winnie. She likes budgies."
Chilli: "Oh, she sounds nice."
Bluey: "She is. We played Café. But dad said we couldn't go to her house for breakfast."
Bandit: "Well, we'd only just met them."
Bluey: "But Winnie's my friend. And you're friends with her dad."
Bandit: "Well, I wouldn't say we're friends yet."
Bluey: "Why? Don't you like him?"
Bandit: "Well, yeah, he's a good guy."
Bluey: "So why aren't you friends?"
Bandit: "Well, we just need to get to know each other a bit better first."
Bluey: "How long will that take?"
Bandit: "It'll take as long as it takes."
Bluey: "You sure take a long time to make friends."
Chilli: "Well, a café's a great place to get to know someone."
Bingo manages to pour some orange juice in her glass, but she spills a lot too.
Bingo: "Ah!"
Bingo giggles.
The next morning at the playground, Fido is already sitting on a bench. Bandit and Bluey come in through the gate.
Bluey: "Winnie!"
Bluey runs off screen.
Winnie: (off screen) "Bluey!"
Fido: "Back for more?"
Bandit: "Gotta be done."
Bandit takes a seat on the other bench. The moment he does:
Bluey, Winnie: "Customers!"
Bandit and Fido are sitting down at the table.
Bandit: "Yeah, it is a good school, actually."
Winnie sets a bark chip down in front of each of them.
Winnie: "Here are your chai lattes."
Bluey sets a pile of twigs down in the middle of the table.
Bluey: "These are sugar packets."
Bandit: "Ooh, really?"
Fido: "Ooh!"
Bluey holds them back.
Bluey: "But, they're just for chai lattes, okay? You can't just eat them."
Bandit, Fido: "Uh, sure, we won't."
Bluey walks away. Bandit and Fido immediately pretend to pour sugar packets directly into their mouths.
Bluey: "Aah! They're eating sugar packets!"
Fido: "We're made. Run!"
Bandit: "Grab the sugar!"
Fido: "Yeah!"
Bandit and Fido each scoop up some twigs and run. Bluey and Winnie chase after them.
Bluey: "Get them, Winnie."
Fido, followed by Bandit, run up the seesaw, causing it to move as they pass the fulcrum.
Bandit: "They're coming!"
Fido: "Quick!"
Fido climbs up the slide.
Fido: "Get up here, Bandit! Come on!"
Fido gives Bandit a hand climbing the slide, as Bluey and Winnie reach the bottom of the slide and start climbing.
Bluey: "Come back here!"
Bandit and Fido crawl into a roofed part of the structure.
Fido: "Look out!"
Bandit: "All right!"
Fido slides down a different slide. Bandit slides down on his belly, crashing into Fido.
Bandit: "Oof!"
They stand up and keep running.
Bandit: "Save the sugar!"
Bandit scales a climbing net.
Bandit: "Get up here, Fido!"
Fido follows, having some trouble with the net.
Fido: "Oh, this net..."
Bluey: "We'll get you!"
Bandit: "Down here. Whoa!"
Bandit slides down a tube slide, followed by Fido. The slide spits them out on the ground.
Bandit and Fido: "Oof!"
They get up, laughing, and run off as Winnie and Bluey reach the bottom of the slide and give chase
Bluey: "Put that sugar down!"
Fido: "No way."
Bluey: "It's for your chai lattes!"
Fido: "Unh-unh!"
Bandit: "Run, Fido!"
Later, in the dining room, the Heelers are eating sliced fruit for breakfast.
Bluey: "And then we chased them around the whole playground!"
Chilli: "Well, it sounds like you all had a lot of fun."
Bandit: "Yeah, we did."
Bingo: "Can I come and play Café tomorrow?"
Bandit: "Yeah, if you get up early."
Bingo: "Okay."
Bluey: "Are you and Winnie's dad friends now?"
Bandit: "Oh, well, a little bit. I don't know. Eat your breakfast."
Bluey and Chilli give each other a thumbs-up.
The next morning, Bandit is stretching in front of the house. Bluey walks down the stairs.
Bandit: "Okay, let's go!"
Bingo walks onto the porch.
Bingo: "I'm up!"
Bandit: "Hey, Bingo!"
Later, at the playground, Bluey and Winnie are running the café kitchen, while Bandit and Fido talk at the table.
Bandit: "Oh-ho, no way! So what'd you do?"
Bingo, acting as server, carries a handful of bark chips to the table. She drops them, one by one, as she walks.
Fido: "Well, I'm looking at this snake, and I'm thinking 'this guinea pig is not looking—'"
Bingo arrives with the last remaining bark chip.
Bingo: "Granola!"
Bandit: "Oh, thanks. Hey, there's only one granola!"
The kids laugh.
Fido: "I think the staff here are just too young."
Bandit and Fido stand and pose heroically.
Bandit: "Well, Fido, we have no choice but to—"
Bingo pulls on Bandit's arm.
Bingo: "Ooh, Dad, can you push me on the swing?"
Bingo pulls Bandit away.
Bandit: "Ah, yeah, sure."
Bandit: (to Fido) "Sorry, mate."
Fido: "No worries."
Fido sits back down.
Bandit pushes Bingo on the swings.
Bingo: ♫ "Oh, a bit higher please." ♫
Bandit watches the game of Café continue without him.
Bluey: "What would you like to order? And, do you like my dad?"
Fido: "Croissant, please. And, yeah, I do like your dad."
Winnie hands Fido a bark chip.
Winnie: "Good. Because he likes you."
Bluey: "And we're all out of croissants."
Bluey takes the bark chip back.
Bandit: "Bingo, you sure you don't want to play Café?"
Bingo: "No, thanks."
Bandit: (sadly) "Okay."
Bandit watches the game of Café. Fido spits out his drink.
Fido: "Pbbbt! This is soy milk!"
Bluey and Winnie laugh and run away.
Later, at breakfast, the Heelers are eating cereal. Bingo sleepily tries to pour some more cereal into her bowl.
Bluey: "And Winnie has seen a echidna for real life!"
Chilli: "Wow."
Bluey:"Chyeah! That's what I said."
Chilli: "And how's Winnie's dad?"
Bandit: "Oh, I don't know. I didn't get to chat to him much this morning."
Chilli: "Oh, too bad."
Bandit: "Are we almost ready to have breakfast with them yet? Well, not just yet. But soon."
Chilli puts her hand on Bluey's arm encouragingly. Bingo finally gets the cereal to pour, greatly overfilling her bowl.
Bingo: "Whoa!"
The next morning, Bandit does his stretches in the front lawn. Bluey comes down the front steps.
Bandit: "Is Bingo coming?"
Bluey: "No, she's still asleep."
Bandit: "Oh, okay. Well, just us, then. Come on."
They talk as they walk to the playground.
Bluey: "We're going to make disgusting smoothies for you and Fido."
Bandit: "Well, we're gonna eat all your gingerbread men and run off without paying."
Bluey giggles.
They arrive at the playground.
Bluey: "Oh, they're not here."
Bandit: "Well, I guess they don't come every morning."
A bit later, Bandit sits at the table, alone. Bluey brings him a drink.
Bluey: "Here's your smoothie."
Bandit: "Oh, thanks."
Bandit pretends to gulp it down.
Bandit: "Gluk, gluk, gluk!
He pretends to spit it out.
Bandit: "Bleh! Pleh! Aw, yuck! Pleh!"
Bluey giggles for a moment, but they both soon go quiet.
Bluey: "I wish Winnie was here."
Bandit: "I know you do."
Bandit pats Bluey on the shoulder. She sits down in the other seat.
Bluey: "Do you wish Winnie's dad was here?"
Bandit thinks for a moment.
Bandit: "Yeah, I do. He's good fun, actually."
Bluey: "If you asked Winnie's dad to be your friend, do you think he would say yes?"
Bandit: "Well, I don't know. Maybe."
Bluey: "If you weren't my dad, I'd want to be your friend."
Bandit: "Aw, thanks, mate."
He pats Bluey on the head and stands up.
Bandit: "Come on. We have to get back for brekkie."
Winnie: (off screen) "Bluey!"
Winnie runs towards them.
Bluey: "Winnie!"
She runs up to Bluey for a hug. They spin each other around. Fido jogs up and shakes Bandit's hand.
Fido: "Sorry we're late. Buggalugs slept in."
Bandit: "No worries. We were just heading back for brekkie."
Winnie: "Oh..."
Fido: "O-Okay. No worries."
Bandit: "Well, um..."
Bandit looks at the kids. Winnie looks sad. Bluey smiles at him encouragingly.
Bandit: "Would you like to come
to our house for breakfast?"
The kids start wagging their tails.
Winnie: "For real life?"
Bandit: "Only if it's okay with your dad. I mean, it's pretty short notice."
Winnie: "Can we, Dad, please?"
Fido: "Yeah. Righto."
Bluey, Winnie: "Yeah!"
The leave the playground together. Bandit and Fido walk side by side. Bluey gives Winnie a piggyback ride, zigzagging as Winnie points to show her where to go.
Fido: "How long does it take to get to your place?"
Bandit: "Eh, not too long. Here, I saved you some smoothie."
Bandit pretends to hand Fido a drink. He takes it.
Fido: "Oh, thanks!"
The episode music continues over the end credits, with a recorder gradually taking over the melody from the strings. A willie wagtail lands, and hops back and forth. It flies away again as the credits conclude.
