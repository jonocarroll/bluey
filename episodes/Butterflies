The episode begins in the backyard of the Heeler's family house. Bandit is hanging a fabric swing on a branch and Bluey is playing with a slap wrap.
Bingo: "Make sure it's nice and high off the ground."
Bandit: "Yes, boss."
Bluey snaps the wrap on Bandit's tail.
Bluey: "Snap!"
Bandit: "OW! Bluey! That's not making this any easier."
Judo peeks over the hedge.
Judo: "What are you doing, Bluey's Dad?"
Bluey: "Hey, Judo."
Bandit: "Just putting up a swing."
Bluey: "Yeah, it's a fabric swing."
Bingo: "Yeah, they have them at Bluey's school."
Judo: "I know that. Bluey's my friend."
Bingo silently takes a step back. Bandit finishes putting up the swing.
Bandit: "All right, have fun, squids. I've gotta take the washing in."
He climbs down from the bench, and walks off with a laundry basket.
Bluey runs across the bench and jumps into the swing. She giggles.
Bluey: "Let's play butterflies!"
Bingo, Judo: "Yeah!"
TITLE CARD - Butterflies!
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called: Butterflies."
The scene transitions to Bluey crawling like a caterpillar.
Bluey: "Okay, first, the caterpillar crawls along the ground..."
She climbs into the swing.
Bluey: "...then it gets in the cocoon."
She jumps out of the swing. She walks around, flapping her arms.
Bluey: "Then it hatches as a butterfly."
Cut to Bluey, hiding behind the shed.
Bluey: "But the butterfly catchers have been hiding..."
Bluey makes a snatching motion with both arms.
Bluey: "...and catch it."
Bingo raises her hand and wags her tail excitedly.
Bingo: "Ooh, can I be the caterpillar first?!"
Judo: "I'm going first."
Bingo takes a step back from Judo.
Bluey: "Come on, Bingo. We'll be the butterfly catchers."
Bluey runs off, with Bingo following behind her. Judo gets down on the ground and starts inching along like a caterpillar.
Judo: "Eep eep eep eep, eep-eep-eep eeep."
Cut to Bingo and Bluey, peering around the edge of the shed.
Bingo: "Judo is so bossy."
Bluey: "Yeah, she is, but she doesn't have anyone else to play with."
Bingo notices a ladybird walking on the wall of the shed.
Bingo: "Ooh!"
The scene cuts to a close-up of the ladybird, with a huge, detailed Bingo looming in the background.
Bingo: ♫ "Poor little bug on the wall" ♫
Bingo: ♫ "Ding, ching" ♫
Bingo: ♫ "No one to love him at all" ♫
Bingo: ♫ "Ding, ching" ♫
Cut back to Judo. She climbs into the cocoon, as Bluey and Bingo continue to lurk behind the shed in the background.
Bingo: ♫ "No one to tickle his toes" ♫
Bingo: ♫ "Ding, ching" ♫
Cut back to the shed.
Bingo: ♫ "No one to blow his nose" ♫
Bluey and Bingo blow raspberries. They both laugh.
Bluey: "She's coming out!"
Judo jumps out of the swing, waving her arms like a butterfly.
Judo: "Flap, flap, flap, flap-flap-flap."
Bluey: "Catch her!"
Bingo: "Yaaah!"
Bluey and Bingo chase after Judo, all three of them squealing happily. Bluey and Bingo grab Judo and pull her to the ground. Bingo lies down on the ground.
Bingo: "My turn!"
Judo: (scornfully) "You're too small to be a caterpillar."
Bingo: "No, I'm not!"
Bluey: "Go on, Bingo. We'll be the butterfly catchers."
Bluey runs towards the shed. Judo gives Bingo an angry look before catching up with Bluey. Bingo wags her tail, and starts pretending to be a caterpillar."
Bingo: "Eep-eep-eep-eep! Eep, eep, eep, eep! Eep!"
Bluey and Judo hide behind the shed. Bingo crawls towards the swing.
Bingo: "Eep! Eep! Eep eep!"
Bingo squeals with laughter. Cut back to Bluey and Judo watching from the shed.
Bingo: "Eeeep! Eep eep eep!"
Bingo starts trying to climb into the swing, but it seems to be a bit too high for her. She jumps twice, and gets her arms in on the third try.
Bingo: "Eep! Eep! Eep-eep-eep-eep!"
Cut back to the shed. Judo sighs.
Judo: (annoyed) "Little kids take so long to do everything!"
Bluey: "She's only got little legs."
Bingo finally gets her whole body into the swing.
Bingo: ♫ "Poor little bug on the wall" ♫
Bingo: ♫ "Ding, ching" ♫
Bingo: ♫ "No one to love him at all" ♫
Bingo: ♫ "Ding, ching" ♫
Cut back to the shed. Both Bluey and Judo look bored. Judo rolls her eyes.
Bluey: "Hurry up, Bingo.
Bingo continues singing offscreen.
Judo: "Hey, Bluey."
Bluey: "Yeah?"
Judo: (whispering) "Let's run away from Bingo."
Bluey: "What? Why?"
Judo: "She's taking ages!"
Bluey: "Well, uh..."
Bluey looks at the swing, worried. Judo runs off.
Judo: "Come on!"
Cut to the swing. Judo runs across the yard in the background.
Bingo: ♫ "No one to tickle his toes" ♫
Cut back to the shed. Bluey runs off after Judo.
Bluey: "Wait for me!"
Cut back to the swing.
Bingo: ♫ "No one to blow his nose" ♫
Bingo blows a raspberry, finishing the song.
Bingo: "Okaaay! I think I'm almost ready to be a butterfly now!"
Bingo jumps out of the swing, giggling. She prances in a circle, waving her arms.
Bingo: "Ooh! Look at me. I'm a butterfly! Flap, flap, flap, flap!"
She goes by the shed.
Bingo: "I'm flapping around. I hope there's no butterfly catchers nearby!"
She takes a look behind the shed— only to find out Bluey & Judo are not there.
Bingo: "Oh, where are they?"
Cut to the side of the house, where Bandit is taking laundry down from the drying line. Bingo walks by, still flapping.
Bingo: "Flap, flap, flap, flaaaap!"
Judo: (offscreen) ♫ "Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean" ♫
Bingo reaches the front yard, where Bluey and Judo are playing Pat-a-cake on the front walk.
Judo: ♫ "My mother—" ♫
Bingo: "Bluey! You were meant to catch me."
Judo: "AAAAAH! Quick, Bluey, run away!"
Judo then runs away. Bluey silently looks back and forth between Judo and Bingo. She runs after Judo, grimacing.
Judo: "Quick! We can hide in my house!"
Bingo tears up and walks to the swing in the back yard.
Bingo: "Flap, flap, flap."
She climbs into the swing.
Cut to the front yard of Judo's house. Judo and Bluey pop up from behind a bush.
Judo: "I think we lost her."
Bluey: "Uh, I might go and see if Bingo's all right."
Judo: "She'll be fine. Now, let's play phones."
Judo extends her left thumb and pinky in the universal gesture for "phone," and pretends to dial a number on her palm.
Bluey: "Phones?"
Judo: "Ring, ring."
Judo points at Bluey's hand.
Judo: (insistently) "Ring, ring!"
Bluey makes the gesture for a phone, but doens't pick it up.
Bluey: "I just think that Bingo might like—"
Judo: (yelling) "Ring, ring!"
Bluey: "Aaah!"
Bluey picks up the "phone."
Bluey: "Hello?"
Judo immediately changes to a pleasant demeanor. She examines her nails as she talks.
Judo: "Hi. It's me, Judo. I've had such a nice day. Let me tell you all about it."
Bluey: "Okay..."
Judo walks away, fading out as she walks offscreen.
Judo: "First, I bought some lovely..."
Bluey: "Oh, is that right?"
Cut to Bingo, still in the swing. She sings sadly.
Bingo: ♫ "Poor little bug on the wall" ♫
Bingo: ♫ "Ding, ching" ♫
Bingo: ♫ "No one to love him at all" ♫
Bingo: ♫ "Ding, ching" ♫
Cut back to Judo's front lawn. Bluey sits on the front lawn, bored. Judo faces away from her, on the far side of the yard.
Judo: "So, then I went to the bakery to get some cream buns for Casper, but they ran out of cream buns. Could you believe it?"
Bluey: "Judo, I think I need to find Bingo."
Judo: "So then I asked for chocolate éclairs..."
Bluey: "Judo—"
Judo: "...but they were out of them, too!
Judo stomps her foot for emphasis.
Judo: "I mean, come on. I just don't know what the world's coming to."
Bluey: "Okay, then. I'm going now. Bye."
Bluey hangs up her imaginary phone and stands up. Judo continues talking, oblivious.
Judo: "I mean, are you trying to run a shop?
Bluey runs back to her front yard.
Bluey: "Bingo! Bingo, where are you?"
Bluey runs to the side yard, where Bandit is still taking down the laundry. Bluey throws all the laundry out of the basket.
Bluey: "Bingo!"
Bandit: "Hey!"
Bluey approaches the swing.
Bluey: "I'm sorry, Bingo, I didn't mean to run away from you. Judo made me do it."
She rubs her arm, ashamed.
Bluey: "Well... she didn't make me do it. I did it a bit myself. I'll never do it again, Bingo. I promise. Please can we play together?"
Bingo doesn't answer. Bluey starts to tear up and sits down on the lawn next to the swing.
Bluey: ♫ "Poor little bug on the wall" ♫
Bluey: ♫ "Ding, jing" ♫
Bluey: ♫ "No one to love her at all" ♫
After a few moments, Bingo answers.
Bingo: ♫ "Jing, jing" ♫
Bluey turns around to look at Bingo in the swing.
Bluey: ♫ No one to tickle his toes" ♫
Bingo sticks her head out of the swing.
Bingo: ♫ "Jing, jing" ♫
Bluey stands and walks up to the swing.
Bluey: ♫ "No one to blow his nose" ♫
Bingo's tail wags slowly.
Bingo: ♫ "Jing, jing" ♫
Bingo then offers a hug to Bluey. They embrace, tails wagging.
Judo: (yelling offscreen) "RING, RING!"
Bluey and Bingo both wince. Bluey holds up her hand in the "phone" gesture.
Bluey: "Oh, no! It's Judo on the phone! Tell her I'm not here!"
Bluey holds her hand out to Bingo.
Bingo: "No! Quick, hide!"
Cut to the side yard, wher Bandit is resignedly re-loading the laundry basket. Judo walks past, with her "phone" to her ear.
Judo: "RING, RING!"
Bandit, startled, jumps up and puts his hands to his ears; overturning the laundry basket.
Bandit: "Aah!"
Cut to the back yard. Judo walks across the yard.
Judo: "Ring, ring! Bluey! Where are you?"
The scene changes to Bluey and Bingo hiding inside the swing.
Bingo: "Put your phone on silent!"
Bluey: "Oh, yeah. Good idea."
She pokes her palm.
Bluey: "Bzz bzz! Thanks, Bingo."
Judo suddenly peeks inside the swing, startling Bluey and Bingo.
Bluey, Bingo: "Aaaah!"
Judo: "There you are! You ran away from me."
Bingo sticks her head out of the swing.
Bingo: "Well, you ran away from me!"
Judo turns away, folding her arms. Bluey sticks her head out of the other side of the swing.
Bluey: "And you were ignoring me."
Judo drops her arms.
Judo: (sheepishly) "Oh, yeah. I did..."
Bluey climbs out of the swing.
Bluey: "Okay, new rule. From now on, no one runs away from anyone, okay?"
Judo: "Okay."
Bingo: "Okay."
Bluey: "Sorry, Judo."
Judo: "That's okay. I'm sorry, too, Bingo."
Bingo: "That's okay. Just don't do it again."
Judo, Bingo, and Bluey hug each other, giggling.
Bluey: "All right, Bingo, you can be the butterfly."
Bingo: "Actually, I wanna be the catcher."
Bluey: "Me too."
Judo: "Me too."
Bluey: "Oh, but who will we catch, then?"
Bandit: (offscreen) ♫ "I'm gonna..." ♫
Cut to the side yard. Bandit sings as he finishes loading the laundry basket.
Bandit: ♫ "...put these clean clothes away, unh" ♫
Bandit: ♫ "Put these clean clothes away, unh" ♫
Cut to the back porch. Bandit walks up to the rear steps, as the children hide nearby.
Bandit: ♫ "Put these clean clothes away" ♫
Bandit: ♫ "I'm gonna—" ♫
All three girls leap out of hiding and tackle him.
Bluey, Bingo, Judo: "Yaaah!"
Bandit: "Aaah!"
The melody of Poor Little Bug on the Wall plays over the end credits as Bluey dances.
