The episode begins in the backyard of the Heeler's family house. Bandit is hanging a fabric swing on a branch and Bluey is playing with a slap wrap.
Bingo: Make sure it's nice and high off the ground.
Bandit: Yes, boss.
Bluey snaps the wrap on Bandit's tail.
Bluey: Snap!
Bandit: OW! Bluey! That's not making this any easier.
Judo peeks over the hedge.
Judo: What are you doing, Bluey's Dad?
Bluey: Hey, Judo.
Bandit: Just putting up a swing.
Bluey: Yeah, it's a fabric swing.
Bingo: Yeah, they have them at Bluey's school.
Judo: I know that. Bluey's my friend.
Bandit finishes putting up the swing.
Bandit: All right, have fun, squids. I've gotta take the washing in.
Bluey excitingly jumps into the swing, giggling in the process.
Bluey: Let's play butterflies!
Bingo & Judo: Yeah!
Bingo : This episode of Bluey is called Butterflies.
The scene transitions to Bluey crawling like a caterpillar.
Bluey: Okay, first, the caterpillar crawls along the ground, then it gets in the cocoon. Then it hatches as a butterfly. But the butterfly catchers have been hiding and catch it.
Bingo: Ooh, can I be the caterpillar first?
Judo: I'm going first.
Bluey: Come on, Bingo. We'll be the butterfly catchers.
Bluey & Bingo run to hide behind the shed, while Judo lies down on the ground and begins crawling.
Bingo: Judo is so bossy.
Bluey: Yeah, she is, but she doesn't have anyone else to play with.
Bingo notices a ladybug walking on the wall of the shed.
Bingo: Ooh!
The scene cuts to a more detailed close-up of Bingo.
Bingo: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪
♪ Ding, jing ♪
♪ No one to love him at all ♪
♪ Ding, jing ♪
♪ No one to tickle his toes ♪
♪ Ding, jing ♪
♪ No one to blow his nose ♪
Bluey & Bingo stick out their tongues and blow hard making a farting noise. They both then laugh.
Bluey: She's coming out!
Judo jumps out of the swing, waving her arms like a butterfly.
Bluey: Catch her!
Judo tries to run away, but Bluey & Bingo catch her. Bingo then lies down on the ground.
Bingo: My turn.
Judo: You're too small to be a caterpillar.
Bingo: No, I'm not!
Bluey: Go on, Bingo. We'll be the butterfly catchers.
Bluey then runs towards the shed. Judo gives Bingo an angry look before catching up with Bluey. After that, Bingo starts crawling. She then gets in the swing, struggling a bit in the process.
Judo: Little kids take so long to do everything!
Bluey: She's only got little legs.
Bingo finally gets inside the swing.
Bingo: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪
♪ Ding, jing ♪
♪ No one to love him at all ♪
♪ Ding, jing ♪
The scene changes to Bluey and Judo standing behind the shed.
Bluey: Hurry up, Bingo.
Judo: Hey, Bluey.
Bluey: Yeah?
Judo: Let's run away from Bingo.
Bluey: What? Why?
Judo: She's taking ages!
Bluey: Well, uh... 
Judo: Come on!
Bluey: Wait for me!
Bingo finishes the song.
Bingo: Okay! I think I'm almost ready to be a butterfly now!
Bingo jumps out of the swing, again, waving her arms.
Bingo: Ooh! Look at me. I'm a butterfly!
Bingo: I'm flapping around. I hope there's no butterfly catchers nearby!
She takes a look behind the shed, only to find out Bluey & Judo are not there.
Bingo: Oh, where are they?
Bingo goes to looks for them both, still waving her arms. She walks by Bandit who is hanging laundry and still has the slap band on his tail. She then sees Bluey and Judo playing Pat-a-cake.
Bingo: Bluey! You were meant to catch me.
Judo: AAAAAH! Quick, Bluey, run away!
Judo then runs away. Meanwhile, Bluey is put in an uncomfortable situation and has to act fast. She turns around to follow Judo, while a look of regret appears on her face.
Judo: Quick! We can hide in my house!
Bingo tears up and returns to the swing.
Bingo: Flap, flap, flap.
Meanwhile, Bluey & Judo emerge from a bush.
Judo: I think we lost her.
Bluey: Uh, I might go and see if Bingo's all right.
Judo: She'll be fine. Now, let's play phones. 
Bluey: Phones?
Judo: Ring, ring. Ring, ring!
Bluey: I just think that Bingo might like-
Judo: Ring, ring!!!
Bluey: Aaah! Hello?
Judo: Hi. It's me, Judo. I've had such a nice day. Let me tell you all about it.
Bluey: Okay...
Judo: First, I bought some lovely new plants...
Bluey: Oh, is that right?
The scene cuts to Bingo sitting in the swing sad, singing the song. Then the scene cuts back to the front of Judo's house. Bluey is sitting on the lawn. She appears bored.
Judo: So, then I went to the bakery to get some cream buns for Casper, but they ran out of cream buns. Could you believe it?
Bluey: Judo, I think I need to find Bingo.
Judo: So then I asked for chocolate éclairs...
Bluey: Judo-
Judo: ...but they were out of them, too! I mean, come on. I just don't know what the world's coming to.
Bluey: Okay, then. I'm going now. Bye. 
Bluey: Bingo! Bingo, where are you?
Bluey then runs past Bandit, who was still hanging the laundry. Bluey decides to look for her in the laundry basket, throwing out some of the laundry out.
Bandit: Hey!
Bluey then approaches the swing where Bingo sits.
Bluey: I'm sorry, Bingo, I didn't mean to run away from you. Well... she didn't make me do it. I did it a bit myself. I'll never do it again, Bingo. I promise. Please can we play together?
Bingo doesn't answer. Bluey starts to tear up and sits down on the lawn next to the swing.
Bluey: ♪ Poor little bug on the wall ♪
♪ Ding, jing ♪
♪ No one to love her at all ♪
Bingo: ♪ Jing, jing ♪
Bluey: ♪ No one to tickle his toes ♪
Bingo: ♪ Jing, jing ♪
Bingo then offers a hug to Bluey, which she accepts.
Judo: RING, RING!
Bluey: Oh, no! It's Judo on the phone! Tell her I'm not here!
Bingo: No! Quick, hide!
Judo walks by Bandit, who was picking up the laundry basket. As she walks by, she makes the "Ring, ring!" sound, which scares Bandit, causing him to drop the basket. Next she walks by the swing.
Judo: Ring, ring! Bluey! Where are you?
The scene changes to Bluey & Bingo hiding inside the swing.
Bingo: Put your phone on silent!
Bluey: Oh, yeah. Good idea. Thanks, Bingo.
Judo then suddenly peeks inside the swing, which scares both Bluey and Bingo.
Judo: There you are! You ran away from me.
Bingo: Well, you ran away from me!
Bluey: And you were ignoring me.
Judo: Oh, yeah. I did...
Bluey: Okay, new rule. From now on, no one runs away from anyone, okay?
Judo: Okay.
Bingo: Okay.
Bluey: Sorry, Judo.
Judo: That's okay. I'm sorry, too, Bingo.
Bingo: That's okay. Just don't do it again.
The three girls then hug each other, giggling.
Bluey: All right, Bingo, you can be the butterfly.
Bingo: Actually, I wanna be the catcher.
Bluey: Me too.
Judo: Me too.
Bluey: Oh, but who will we catch, then?
Bandit: ♪ I'm gonna put these
clean clothes away, unh ♪
♪ Put these clean
clothes away, unh ♪
♪ Put these clean clothes away,
I'm gonna --♪
His singing gets interrupted because the three girls jumped on him.
