The episode opens in the back yard. Chilli sits under the poinciana tree, reading a fantasy novel. Bluey is in an inflatable wading pool, running in counterclockwise circles around the outside edge. Bingo runs up and climbs over the rim.
Bingo: "Oop!"
She splashes into the water, and is carried away by the current, squealing. She finds her footing and joins Bluey in running in circles, laughing. Bluey howls.
Bluey: "Woooo!"
Bluey runs past the camera, laughing. A moment later, Bingo does the same.
Bluey runs past Chilli, reading in the background. She grabs the rim of the pool as she passes. Bingo follows her, also grabbing the rim.
Bluey and Bingo continue running in circles. Chucky pops his head up over the fence. He watches for a moment, then jumps over the fence. He runs up and clambers into the pool.
He starts running as well, laughing.
Chucky: "Yeah!"
Bluey: (howls) "Faster!"
Bingo squeals and laughs.
The camera cuts to an underwater view. Bluey's legs run past the camera, followed by Bingo.
Cut back to the surface. The camera focuses on Bluey, as the background blurs behind her.
Bluey: "Woo! Keep going!"
The camera pans over to follow Bingo.
Bingo: "Yeah! Faster, faster!"
The camera pans over to follow Chucky.
Chucky: "Keep going!"
The camera pulls back to show all three running in the pool.
Bluey, Bingo, Chucky: "Ready, and... go!"
All three children flop over on their sides. They lay on their backs and let the current carry them in circles.
Bluey, Bingo, Chucky: "Wooo!"
Chucky: "Yeah!"
The camera focuses on Chucky, laughing uproariously.
Cut to Bingo, splashing with her arms and legs.
Cut to Bluey, laughing as she watches the wake of water from her arm.
Cut to a shot from below, dramatically exagerrating the depth of the pool. The three kids continue to be carried in circles by the whirlpool.
Cut to a closer shot from beneath. Bluey floats over the camera, wagging her tail.
Cut back to the surface. The children continue laughing as the water slows to a stop.
They stand, and their faces fall as the fun is over.
Chucky brightens up and points.
Chucky: "Should we go the other way?"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bluey, Bingo, and Chucky begin running clockwise. The camera pans up into the sky as they continue to squeal and laugh.
