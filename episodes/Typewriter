The episode opens with a view of Glasshouse Primary School. Then goes to Bluey using "the real typewriter"
Terrier: Archers, ready! Pwing! Pwing! Pwing!
Bluey: How we gonna get past the arrows?
Winton: Use a shield!
Bluey: I don't have a shield!
Winton: Use this one!
Winton hands Bluey an imaginary shield.
Bluey: Oh, thanks! Hang on!
They stand up and approach the Terrier.
Terrier: Pwing!
Bluey: Badoing.
Terrier: Huh? Pwing!
Bluey: Badoing.
Terrier: Hey, I'm shooting bows and arrows at you!
Bluey: Yeah and I'm badoinging them with my shield.
Terrier: Oh no! Pwing! Pwing! Pwing!
Bluey: Badoing. Badoing. Badoing.
The Terrier screams and runs away.
Bluey and Winton: Hooray!
The wind picks up and blows away the cloth on the box Calypso's sitting on, revealing the typewriter inside.
