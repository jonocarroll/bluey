The episode opens with a view of Glasshouse Primary School. Then goes to Bluey using "the real typewriter"
Bluey: Tick, tick, tick, ching!
Bluey: Tick, tick, tick, ching!
Hey, Bluey, Calypso's telling a story!
Bluey: Ooh.
Calypso: There once was an old dog who had sat on a chest by the side of the road for all his life, begging for treats.
Snickers falls over.
Snickers: Oh. Ooh. Mm.
Calypso: Up you get, Snickers.
Calypso begins to tell the class the story.
Calypso: One day, a gnome came by and said to the old dog, "Have you tried opening that chest you sit on to see what's inside?"
Calypso: "Oh, no, of course not. There's nothing inside. It is empty."
Winton: Can I sit next to you, Coco?
Coco: Mm.
Calypso: But the gnome insisted that the old dog open the chest and when he did, he discovered that it was full of treats!
Ooh.
Huh? That doesn't make any sense.
Snickers: Aah! Ooh.
TITLE CARD - Typewriter
This episode of Bluey is called Typewriter.
Bluey: Why didn't the old dog look in the chest sooner?
I'm not sure.
Bluey: Well, I'm going to write a story where he looked in the chest straightaway and he saw the treats.
Bluey: Hey, where did the real typewriter go?
I don't know.
Bluey: I'll go ask Calypso. I can't be a storywriter without a real typewriter.
Bluey spots Snickers, who is looking very sad.
Bluey: Hey, Snickers, what's wrong?
Snickers: Everyone else has learnt to sit except me.
Bluey: But you're a sausage dog, it's gonna take you longer.
Snickers: Why?
Bluey: 'Cause you're longer.
Snickers: Aww! I hate being a sausage dog.
Bluey: Why don't you come with me to see Calypso? Maybe she can help you too.
Snickers: OK, thanks, Bluey.
Bluey and Snickers find Winton sobbing quietly in the fetal position.
Bluey: Hey, Winton, what's wrong?
Winton: Everyone keeps running away from me.
Bluey: Oh, no they don't.
Winton: They do!
AHH! Winton!
Well, why don't you come and see Calypso with us? Maybe she can help.
OK, let's get going!
I'll follow you!!
Oh, no!
The English are approaching!
Archers, ready.
Ready!
Hold and fire.
Pling!
And fire!
Pling!
Hey, we're shooting bows and arrows at you.
Not real ones!
They're pretend real!
We're not playing your game, we're going to see Calypso.
I'm looking for the real typewriter.
Awww!
Please can you pretend that they're pretend real?
Oh, OK.
Arrows! Get down!
Whoa! Argh!
Hooray! Pling.
And fire!
Pling.
How are we gonna get past them?
Snickers, you sneak around them through those skinny trees. And then wait at the top of the hill to do you know what.
Snickers: Oh, yeah, OK.
Run your little sausage dog legs!
They're trying to outflank us.
I'm going into those skinny trees.
Oh! Why do YOU get to go into the skinny trees?
Because you got to sit in the boot seat this morning, even though it was MY turn. 'Cause I said, "Boot seat!" at breakfast before you.
Oh, alright.
For Scotland!
For Scotland!
Pling, pling, pling.
I'm coming.
Where are you?
What was that?
He-he-he.
Why aren't they attacking us?
I don't know.
Well, I'm going to scout.
Oh, why do you get to scout?
'Cause you got to sit closest to the tap last night.
Even though I said, "Close tap" first on the way back from jiu jitsu.
Oh, alright.
For Scotland!
One's coming!
What do we do?!
I know. When he comes, ask him a question and then he'll run away.
OK.
Winton: Wait, what question?
Any question. It doesn't matter.
Ask him if he's gluten-free.
Alright then.
Winton: Wait, why will he run away if I ask him if he's gluten-free?
'Cause you're a space invader.
Oh, OK.
Winton: Wait, what's a space invader?
It's someone who stands too close.
Like what you're doing right now.
Oh.
Most people stay about this far apart.
But you don't,
you get right up close.
'Cause I'm a space invader?
Yeah.
Oh.
Is that why people keep on running away from me?
Yeah, probably. Try it.
Freeze.
Winton: Are you gluten-free?
Ah!
Winton, not so close.
Winton: Just tell me. Are you gluten-free?
Argh!
Aha! You're right, Bluey!
Come on.
Where are you?
Hey!
Argh! Archers ready.
Pling, pling! Pling, pling.
How are we gonna get past the arrows?
Use a shield.
But I don't have a shield.
Use this one.
Oh, thanks. Hang on.
Pling, pling. Oh! Pling.
Pa-doing.
Huh?
Pling.
Pa-doing.
Hey, I'm shooting bows and arrows at you.
Yeah, and I'm pa-doinging them with my shield.
Oh, no!
Pling, pling, pling.
Pa-doing, pa-doing, pa-doing.
Come on, Winton!
Get 'em. Ya!
Oh, no, they're catching up to us!
Snickers, now!
Snickers begins to roll down the hill.
Snickers: Sausage rolllll.
Snickers: I love being a sausage dog!
Hooray!
Good one, Snickers!
Hey, Winton, look.
I'm not a space invader!
Hey, wait up, guys.
Let's play that again.
Hi, Calypso.
Hello, Bluey. How can I help you?
I can't find the real typewriter.
Oh, are you being a story writer?
Yes.
Well, it's around here somewhere.
Hmm.
Oh, hey, how did you get past the Terriers?
Bluey: I used a shield. See?
Ting, ting.
Ting, ting.
That's a nice shield alright.
Thanks.
OK, typewriter. Where is it?
Calypso: Oh, what if I asked you to show me a typewriter?
Hmm...
Tick, tick, ching.
That's a lovely typewriter, isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
Thanks, Calypso.
I'm going to write my story now.
OK, have fun.
The wind picks up and blows away the cloth on the box Calypso's sitting on, revealing the typewriter inside.
