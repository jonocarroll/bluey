The episode opens in a playground. Bandit and Chilli relax on a bench. Bluey, Bingo, and Missy run up to them.
Bluey: "Mum, Dad! Can we play Pirates on the hammock swing?"
Chilli: "Isn't that game a bit too scary for Missy?"
Bandit: "It's okay. She'll be brave, won't you, Missy?"
He ruffles Missy's hair. She giggles.
Missy: "I'll try, Mister Heeler."
Bingo: "We'll take care of you, Missy."
Chilli: "Okay, let's play Pirates!"
Bluey, Bingo, Missy: "Hooray! Pirates!"
TITLE CARD - Pirates
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Pirates."
Cut to the hammock swing - a large rubber sheet with a rope on each side, suspended from two poles. It sits on a patch of marbled blue rubber, suggesting water. That, in turn, is surrounded by bark chips. Behind the swing is a small fort-style climbing structure. The segment of the park is on the bank of a river, visible behind them.
Bluey: "Yarrr!"
Exciting, cinematic music begins to play. Bluey, Missy, and Bingo run in. Bandit and Chilli walk in behind them. Bluey climbs onto the swing.
Bluey: "Yarrr!"
Bluey helps Missy up onto the swing. Bingo scoops up an armful of bark chips and climbs up after her. Bandit takes up a position at one end of the hammock swing. Chilli narrates dramatically.
Chilli: "One day, there were three pirates."
Bluey climbs to one end of the swing and dramatically strikes a pose, as though looking off into the distance from the prow of a ship.
Bandit: "Brave pirates."
Bluey: "Yarrr!"
Bingo lets the pile of bark chips sift through her fingers, as though it was a load of gold coins.
Bingo: "Greedy pirates!"
Missy laughs. Chilli takes a seat on the steps of the play structure.
Chilli: "Out in their boat, sailing along."
Bingo: "With our treasure!"
Chilli: "With their treasure."
Bandit gently rocks the swing from side to side.
Chilli: "And the ocean was nice and calm."
Missy: "Oh, this is okay."
Bandit: "Nice and—"
Bluey: "Come on!"
Chilli: (dramatically) "When suddenly, the wind started to blow! Whoooo!"
Chilli makes a big sweeping motion with her arms as she imitates the wind blowing. Bandit rocks the hammock harder.
Bluey: "It's a storm!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeaaaah!"
Bluey: "Whooo!"
Missy, overwhelmed, hops off the swing and cowers behind one of the support poles. She clutches her knees to her chest, eyes squeezed shut.
Bluey: "Missy! Come back!"
Chilli: (awkwardly) "As one of the pirates went and hung out behind a lighthouse—"
Chilli: (gently) "which is fine."
Bandit: "But this was a chance for the little pirate to be super brave!"
Chilli: (to Bandit, pointedly) "She'll be super brave when she's ready."
Chilli: "For now, she's the lighthouse keeper."
Missy looks up.
Bluey: "You call this a storm?!"
Chilli: "Whoa! I bet that'll get the sea angry!"
Bandit: "Roarrr!"
Bandit roars and makes crashing noises with his mouth as he swings the hammock harder.
Chilli: The storm got bigger!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Aaaaah!"
Bluey climbs down from her perch, holding onto the line, as Bandit swings the hammock even harder.
Bluey: "Hold on, everyone!"
Bingo: "Aaaah!"
The camera swoops cinematically as a bark chip gets away from Bingo and slides across the hammock. Bingo gasps.
Bingo: "Oh, no! Me treasure! Yaarghh!"
Bingo slides across the hammock to retrieve it. She manages to catch it, but slides halfway off in the process. She uses one hand to hold onto the line, and the other to hold her bark chips.
Bluey: "Bingo! Missy, we need you!"
Missy clutches her knees and shakes her head.
The camera swings across the hammock cinematically again. Bluey hangs on as her corner of the hammock goes nearly vertical.
Bluey: "Oooooh!"
Then, she pushes off with both legs, sliding on her stomach."
Bluey: "Raaah!"
"The hammock swings out of frame entirely. When it swings back, we see Bingo, still barely hanging on to the side of the hammock.
Bingo: "Aaaah!"
The hammock swings up even further, and Bingo leaves the frame. It swings back down, and Bingo comes back into frame, still screaming. She's lost another bark chip, which bounces across the deck.
Bingo: "Aaaah!"
Bluey: "Bingo!"
Bluey slides across the hammock and grabs Bingo, pulling her to safety.
Bluey: "Gotcha!"
The bark chip bounces across the hammock and lands in Bingo's outstretched hand. Bandit starts to rock the hammock swing less.
Chilli: "Oh! And the brave pirate saved her greedy friend."
Bingo hugs her armload of bark chips while Bluey rolls her eyes.
Bingo: "Me treasure!"
Chilli: "And the ocean was calm again."
Bandit lets the swing come to a stop.
Bluey: "Phew! Missy! The storm's over."
Bingo: "Yeah, it's all calm now."
Missy: "Okay, here I come."
Bingo: "Whoo!"
Bluey: "Yay, Missy!"
Missy runs up to the side of the hammock. Bluey and Bingo each grab and arm and haul her aboard.
Chilli: "Oh! And the lighthouse keeper rejoined them."
Bandit: "When suddenly..."
Chilli: "Something big hit the boat from underneath."
Missy looks worried. Bingo gathers her bark chips, and Bluey bites her lip in anticipation.
Bandit: "Which was the perfect chance for the little pirate to show how brave she was."
Bluey holds Missy's hand.
Bandit: "Boom!"
Bandit lifts the end of the hammock swing, then pushes it down suddenly, causing the whole swing to jump.'
Bluey, Bingo: Aah!"
Missy whimpers, and exits the swing again. She stands with her back pressed to the support pole.
Bluey, Bingo: "Missy, come back!"
Missy: "Unh-unh."
Bandit: "Boom!"
He bounces the swing again.
Bingo, Bluey: "Aah!"
Bingo: (laughing) "What's doing that?"
Chilli: "It was an enormous blue whale, bumping into their boat!"
Bandit makes a goofy face, tongue sticking out."
Bandit: "Boom! Boom!"
He continues to bounce the swing. Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bluey: (laughing) "Come on, Missy! This is fun!"
Missy: "But there's a blue whale on the loose!"
Bandit lets up for a moment.
Bluey: "I'm not scared of a silly blue whale!"
Bingo: "Yeah, more like poo whale!"
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "Boom!"
Bandit bounces the swing hard, launching Bluey and Bingo into the air. They squeal and laugh.
Chilli: "Suddenly, the huge whale swallowed their boat whole!"
Bandit: "Raaahh!"
Bluey and Bingo scream, as Bandit tilts the swing to the side until it's nearly vertical. Bluey and Bingo scramble to the top line and hang on tight. Bingo does so one handed, as her other hand is busy holding her bark chips.
Bluey: "Hold on, pirate!"
The girls scream as Bandit tilts the swing entirely vertical.
Chilli: "And then..."
Bluey and Bingo gasp.
Bandit: "...down the throat, they slid!"
Bluey and Bingo scream as Bandit releases the swing. They slide back and forth across it as he swings it from side to side.
Chilli: "Right into the whale's belly!"
Bandit makes crashing and gurgling noises.
Chilli: "It was all dark and slimy and gurgle-y and burgle-y!"
Chilli: (to Missy) "But still pretty safe and kind of fun."
Bandit twists the swing from side to side.
Bluey: "Who will save us?!"
Chilli: (to Missy) "Maybe the lighthouse keeper is ready to help?"
Missy stomps her foot.
Missy: "No way!"
Bandit stops rocking the swing.
Bandit: "Aw, lighthouse keeper, it's nothing to be scared of."
Bandit roars and makes whale noises and Bluey and Bingo giggle. Another dad shows up and starts pushing his kid on the nearby swing. He looks at Bandit quizzically. Bandit notices - and suddenly stops making noises. He clears his throat.
Bluey: "Why did you stop making the whale noise?"
Bingo: (suspiciously) "Yeah!"
Bandit's eyes keep darting to the other dad.
Bandit: "Oh, um, the whale just went a bit quiet for a bit."
Bingo: "No, don't stop! They're funny."
Bluey: "Mum, why isn't Dad making the whale noise?"
Chilli: (amused) "Hmm. Could it be, this majestic blue whale is embarrassed to be making funny noises in front of another Daddy whale?"
Bluey: "Well, that doesn't make any sense."
Chilli: (amused) "No, it doesn't make any sense."
Bandit: (to Chilli, stage whispering) "Aw, come on! Come on!"
Chilli: (to Bandit) "Well, I'm sure the whale will be brave when he's ready."
Chilli returns to her dramatic narration.
Chilli: "Anyway, the pirates were still stuck in the whale's belly..."
Bluey and Bingo huddle together.
Chilli: "...with no one to save them!"
Missy looks down, guiltily.
Bingo: (echoing faintly) "We're doomed!"
Missy brightens up.
Missy: "Oh, wait a minute. I know how you can get out the whale belly."
Chilli: "Oh, but the pirates couldn't hear the lighthouse keeper. They were stuck inside the..."
Chilli rolls her eyes.
Chilli: "usually noisy whale."
A brief cutaway shows Bandit looking unimpressed.
Chilli: "There was only one thing for it."
Bluey: "What?"
Chilli: (whispering) "The littlest pirate is going to have to get swallowed by the whale, too."
Missy whimpers and clutches the support pole.
Bluey: "Come on, Missy! You can do it!"
Bingo: "I wanna spend me treasure!"
Bingo tosses her bark chips a few inches in the air.
Chilli: "Will she do it?"
The camera cuts to Missy, thinking hard, eyes darting side to side. She clenches her fists at her side, and adopts a determined expression. She turns and stares up the length of the support pole. The camera cuts to a low shot, making it look impressively tall. She begins to climb.
Chilli: (laughing) "What's this?"
Bluey, Bingo: "Go, lighthouse keeper!"
Missy climbs to the top of the pole. She swings hand over hand down the support rope, then hooks a leg over part of the support, climbs onto it, and makes a leap to the hammock.
Chilli: "Oh, and she climbed up into the whale's mouth!"
Missy: "Almost there!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Go, lighthouse keeper!"
Missy slides down the swing. The scale is greatly exaggerated, as though she was actually sliding down a whale's gullet.
Chilli: "Oh! And she slid right down its throat and into its belly to join the others!"
She collides with Bluey and Bingo.
Bluey: "Ooof!"
Bluey, Bingo, Missy: "Yeah!"
Chilli: "What bravery!"
Chilli gestures to Bandit, who still looks nonplussed.
Chilli: "And what an inspiration to those of us out there trying to face our fears!"
Bluey: "What's your idea, Missy?"
Missy: "We tickle him!"
Bluey: "Oh, yeah!"
All three girls tickle the hammock.
Bluey, Bingo, Missy: "Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!"
They turn and look at Bandit expectantly.
Bandit: "Hee hee."
The girls stare at him. Bingo looks disappointed, Missy looks confused. Bluey is just annoyed.
Chilli: "Really?"
Bandit looks away, embarrassed.
Bluey: "Come on! Tickle harder!"
Bluey, Missy, Bingo: "Coochie, coochie!"
Bandit: (embarrassed) "Hoo hoo, hee hee, ha ha."
Bluey, Missy, Bingo: "Coochie, coochie, coo!"
Missy: "Come on, Mr. Blue Whale! This is as hard as I can tickle."
Bandit thinks for a moment, then smiles.
Bandit: "ROAAAAAR!"
Bandit starts to twist the swing from side to side.
Chilli: "Ah! There he goes!"
Bandit: "Raaaaaaaar!"
Bandit lifts the swing. The kids climb up and grab the edge of the hammock. The other Dad watches Bandit with a smile.
Chilli: "He rose up. He was going to spit them out!"
As Bandit laughs villainously, Bluey loses her grip. She slides down, but catches Missy's legs. Missy loses her grip in turn, and catches Bingo's legs. Bingo is only holding on with one hand, as her other arm is busy with her treasure.
Missy: "Pull us up, Bingo!"
Bingo: "I don't have any spare arms!"
Missy, Bluey: "Well, drop your treasure!"
Bingo: (complaining) "Ohh!"
Bingo drops her bark chips.
Bingo: (disappointed) "Yarrrr. Me treasure."
She uses her free arm to haul Missy and Bluey up.
Missy: "Thanks, Bingo."
Bandit: "Rooooar!"
Bandit shakes the swing.
Chilli: "Oh, boy. The whale prepared to spit them out!"
The kids scream. Bandit bounces the swing. The camera swoops cinematically, making it look like the girls are launched high into the air.
Chilli: "And the pirates landed safely back on their pirate ship!"
Bluey and Bingo hug Missy.
Bluey, Bingo, Missy: "Hooray! We did it!"
Chilli: "And it was all thanks to the brave, little lighthouse keeper."
Missy: "Whoo!"
Bandit: "Phew!"
Chilli scoots over, and Bandit climbs up to sit beside her.
Chilli: "And the big blue whale swam off to find his blue whale wife, who loved him that little bit more now."
She taps Bandit's knee. All three girls strike heroic poses on the swing, with Missy having taken Bluey's place at the prow.
Chilli: "And off they sailed again, to look for more treasure."
Bingo: "Yarrrr! Treasure!"
Bluey rolls her eyes.
The episode theme, brassy, bombastic and cinematic, plays over the end credits as Bluey dances.
