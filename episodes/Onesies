Brandy (inhales and sighs) It’s all good, Brandy.
Chilli: So, then your hips go around like this. Yeah, that’s great!
Bluey & Bingo: Giggle
Chilli: Me and my sister Brandy made this dance up for our mum’s birthday when we were kids. I can’t remember all the moves though.
The doorbell rings
Bluey & Bingo: (gasps) That’s her!
Bluey and Bingo open the door
Brandy: Hi, girls!
Bluey & Bingo: Hi!
Chilli: Hey, Brandy!
Brandy: Hi, Chilli.
Bluey & Bingo: (giggle as Chilli wags her tail in front of them)
Chilli: It’s good to see you!
Brandy: Yeah, you too.
Chilli: Kids, this is your Auntie Brandy.
Brandy: Oh, you’ve grown so much! Bluey, you look just like your father.
Bluey: (disappointed) Oh, what?
Bingo: Who do I look like?
Brandy: You look.. just like..
Chilli: You.
Brandy: I brought you some presents!
Bluey & Bingo: Really!
Chilli: Oh,Brandy, you shouldn’t have!
Bluey & Bingo: Onesies!
Chilli: Oh, you really shouldn’t have!
Brandy: Do they not like onesies?
Chilli: They do, it’s just..Bingo has this thing. Um, don’t worry, I’m sure she’s grown out of it.
Brandy: I hope they fit, I wasn’t sure how much they’ve grown in..um..
Chilli: Four years.
Bluey: Hey, mine’s too small!
Bingo: And mine’s too big!
Chilli: Well, then swap them around.
Bluey: Can you make my cheetah onesie fit me?
Chilli: Sorry, Bluey. If it doesn’t fit, it doesn’t fit.
Bluey: Aww, but I want the cheetah!
Chilli: It’s not meant to be, kid.
Bluey: (sadly) Okay.
Brandy: They’re beautiful.
Chilli: It’s been too long.
Brandy: I know… Look, Chilli.
Chilli: Yeah?
Bluey: Uh, Mom!
Bingo: (growling)
Bluey: It’s happening again!
Chilli: Oh, no!
Brandy: What’s going on?
Bandit: Hey, Brandy. How you-(screams)
Bluey: Run!
Title Card
Brandy: This episode of Bluey is called “Onesies”.
Brandy: I don’t understand what’s happening!
Chilli: No time to explain, we have to get to safety!
Brandy: But what about Bandit?
Chilli: Forget him, he’s done!
Bingo: (Roars)
Bluey, Chili, & Brandy: (Scream)
Chili: What do we do?
Bluey: The car!
Brandy: Why had Bingo gone feral?
Bingo: Reow!
Bluey: Onesies make Bingo crazy.
Chili: She sort-of becomes one with the onesie.
Brandy: What?
Bluey: Where’d she go?
Chili: I don’t know!
(Bandit presses his hand on the car window scaring the girls)
Brandy, Chili, & Bluey: (scream)
Bandit: Did you.. get her.. the onesie?!
Brandy: I didn’t know, I’m sorry!
(Bingo attacks Bandit)
Bandit: (screams)
Bluey: Don’t worry, we can live in the car!
Chili: Yeah, there’s plenty of food under the seats!
Brandy: Yeah, and we’ve got music!
Bluey: Oh, yeah!
Chili: Brandy, what was it that you wanted to say earlier?
Brandy: Uhh…Um..
Bingo: (growls)
Brandy, Chili, & Bluey: (scream)
Chili & Brandy: Get out!
They all scream and run away from Bingo
Bluey: Let’s hide behind the shed!
Brandy: I think we lost her!
Chili: (sighs with relief)
Bluey: Auntie Brandy, was there a medium size onesie at the shop?
Brandy: Um, I’m not sure Bluey.
Bluey: Can you ring them and ask?
Chili: Bluey!
Bluey: What?
Brandy: Sorry, Bluey, the last time I saw you zebras were your favorite animal.
Bluey: They used to be, but I changed to cheetahs.
Chili: Four years ago.
Brandy: Look, I have to go, this was a mistake.
Chili: No, Brandy, I’m sorry, don’t go!
Brandy: Say goodbye to Bi…Ahhh!
Bingo attacks Brandy.
Chili & Bluey: Brandy!
Brandy: Run! Save yourselves!
(Laughs)
Chili and Bluey run inside to hide in the bathroom tub.
Chili: I think we’re just going to have a no onesie policy from now on.
Bluey: Mum, why did Auntie Brandy want to leave? Is she sad? And why have we only seen her once in our lives?
Chili: (Sighs) You know how you really want Bingo’s cheetah onesie?
Bluey: Yeah, more than anything!
Chili: But it doesn’t fit you, so you can’t have it, and there’s not really anything anyone can do to make it fit.
Bluey: (Sadly) Yeah.
Chili: Well…
Cuts to the backyard where Bingo’s attacking Brandy while she’s laughing.
Chili: (continues)…there’s something Auntie Brandy wants more than anything as well, but she can’t have it, and there’s not really anything anyone can do about it.
Bingo runs away growling, while Brandy looks sad.
Bluey: Why can’t she just have the thing she wants?
Chili: Because it’s not meant to be.
Chili and Bluey check on Brandy in the backyard.
Bluey: (whispering)There’s Brandy! Let’s see if she’s okay.
Chili: Yeah, she finally comes to visit and we let her get eaten by a cheetah!
Bluey: So rude!
Bingo peaks from behind the tree unknowingly to Bluey and Chili.
Bingo: (growls)
Brandy:(Whispering) No! Go back! Go back!
Chili: Huh?
Bluey: Is she shooing a fly?
Brandy: (Whispering)Run?
Bluey: Brandy, are you shooing a fly?
Brandy: Run, it’s a trap!
Chili & Bluey: Huh?
Bingo shows up and attacks Chili.
Bingo: (growls)
Brandy, Chili, & Bluey: (scream)
Chili: (laughs) Run, Bluey!
Bluey: Ahh!
Bingo chases after Bluey:
Bingo: (growling)
Chili & Brandy: (sigh)
Brandy: I tried to warn you.
Chili: We had to see if you were okay.
Brandy: Thanks, appreciate it!
Chili: Are you okay?
Brandy: Yeah, I will be.
Bingo is growling and chasing Bluey up and down a slide in the background while Chili and Brandy lay on the ground and talk.
Brandy: I’m sorry, Chili.
Chili: Oh, you couldn’t have known Bingo was bananas.
Brandy: No, I mean… I’m sorry it’s been so long.
Chili: Oh.
Brandy: It’s just hard seeing you all. You know?
Chili: I know.
Chili holds Brandy’s hand and they both smile while looking at some clouds.
Brandy: I tell you what, next time I come over, I’m not bringing any onesies.
They both smile at each other.
Bluey: Ahh, help!
Chili: We have to help Bluey!
Brandy: Let’s do the dance!
Chili: The one we did as kids?
Brandy: Yeah! Do you still remember the moves?
Chili: Well, with your help I can.
Bluey is running away from Bingo who is riding a bike.
Bluey: Ahh!
Bingo: (growls)
Bluey: Cheetahs can’t ride bikes!
Bingo crashes into the mailbox while Bluey runs towards Bandit who’s laying down next to the car on his phone.
Bluey: Dad, help!
Bandit: I can’t, I’ve been eaten. Rules are rules.
Bluey: But Bingo’s gonna eat me!
Bandit: Well, zebras are pretty good dodgers.
Bluey: Oh, yeah, they are!
Bandit: You have to become one with your onesie.
Bluey pretends to be a zebra while dodging Bingo’s attacks.
Bluey: (makes zebras noises)
Bingo: (growls while trying to attack her but misses) Reow?
Bluey continues to dodge until Bingo grabs her zebra tail and tries to escape.
Chili: Hey, Bingo!
Bingo: Reow?
Chili: (to Brandy) Ready? 1, 2, 3.
Chili and Brandy do the dance they used to do for their mum while laughing. Bluey and Bingo look at each other then smile and walk towards Chili and Brandy.
Chili: Yup, then this.
Bluey and Bingo laugh then join in on the dance,
Chili: (laughs) No, no, no, hips first.
Bluey: (laughs)
Bingo: (laughs)
Brandy: (laughs) Chili!
Chili: (laughs)
All four of them laugh while dancing.
