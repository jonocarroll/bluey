The episode opens with Brandy, carrying a pale yellow-green tote bag with a lemon and leaf print over her shoulder, approaching the Heelers' house. Looking down, worriedly, she hesitates in front of the porch steps. She takes a deep breath and sighs.
Brandy: It’s all good, Brandy.
She finally grabs the railing and starts to walk up the stairs.
The scene cuts inside to the playroom, where Bluey and Bingo are eagerly watching Chilli, who is showing them a dance, the first move being putting her hands on her hips and swaying them in a slightly circular motion. The girls' tails are wagging.
Chilli: So, then your hips go around like this. 
The girls try the move too, Bluey closely matching Chilli, while Bingo, with arms outstretched and tongue out, only manages a simple back and forth with her hips.
Chilli: Yeah, that’s great!
Bluey and Bingo giggle, dropping their poses, as Chilli transitions to the next move after a quick hop, holding up her open palms next to her ears while still moving her hips. Bluey and Bingo mirror this, albeit without the hop.
Chilli: Me and my sister Brandy made this dance up for our mum’s birthday when we were kids.
Chilli's expression looks slightly worried as she switches to the last move, hands returning to her hips as she does a few tiny kicks. The girls copy her, Bingo doing so with her arms outstretched and her kicks causing her to lean back.
Chilli: I can’t remember all the moves though.
The doorbell rings, prompting all three Heelers, smiling, to pause the dance.
Bluey and Bingo: (gasping) That’s her!
Bluey and Bingo run past Chilli to the foyer to open the door, Brandy standing behind it and waving slightly at them.
Brandy: Hi, girls!
Bluey and Bingo: Hi!
Bluey and Bingo's smiles briefly turn to worry, Bingo twiddling her thumbs, as Chilli approaches.
Chilli: Hey, Brandy!
Chilli steps out onto the porch to hug her sister.
Brandy: Hi, Chilli.
Brandy and Chilli's tails wag, Brandy's down and Chilli's up. Bluey and Bingo giggle as Chilli's tail brushes against them, trying to shield themselves with their hands.
Chilli: It’s good to see you!
Brandy: Yeah, you too.
Brandy and Chilli release each other, the latter stepping back towards her kids. Bingo grabs her mum's arm. Chilli briefly ruffles Bluey's ears.
Chilli: Kids, this is your Auntie Brandy.
Brandy: Oh, you’ve grown so much! 
Brandy kneels down to Bluey's level.
Brandy: Bluey, you look just like your father.
Bluey: (disappointed) Aww, what?
Bingo releases Chilli's arm and takes a few steps towards Brandy.
Bingo: Who do I look like?
Brandy: (looking progressively more dejected as she speaks) You look... just like...
Chilli: You.
Following a brief silence, Brandy's voice shifts to a brighter yet deflecting tone and she stands up again.
Brandy: I brought you some presents!
Brandy digs in her tote bag as Bluey and Bingo's tails start wagging.
Bluey and Bingo: Really?
Chilli: Oh, Brandy, you shouldn’t have!
Brandy pulls out two boxes, one with a red label containing a zebra onesie and the other with a blue label containing a cheetah onesie.
Bluey and Bingo: Onesies!
Bluey and Bingo squeal, quickly snatching up the boxes and running inside. Chilli looks back at them concerned.
Chilli: Oh, you really shouldn’t have...
Brandy: Do they not like onesies?
Chilli turns back to Brandy, who has set her tote down, as she holds her hands out defensively.
Chilli: They do, it’s just... Bingo has this thing. 
Chilli briefly glances behind her, concerned, as she puts her hands back down to her sides.
Chilli: Um, don’t worry, I’m sure she’s grown out of it.
Brandy: I hope they fit, I wasn’t sure how much they’ve grown in... um...
Chilli: Four years.
There's a slightly dejected silence hanging over the sisters before Bluey and Bingo waddle back in. Bluey is wearing a very tight cheetah onesie, the sleeves and legs only coming up to 3/4th length and the hood barely able to go over her ears. Bingo is wearing a very baggy zebra onesie that swamps her in size, the sleeves and legs dragging against the ground and the hood flopping over her eyes. 
Bluey: Hey, mine’s too small!
Bingo: And mine’s too big!
Chilli: Well, then swap them around.
Chilli crosses then uncrosses her hands.
Bluey: Can you make my cheetah onesie fit me?
As Chilli talks, Bingo continues looking down to see past her hood, which eventually starts sliding further over her face. She nods quickly to shift the hood back up.
Chilli: Sorry, Bluey. If it doesn’t fit, it doesn’t fit.
Bluey: Aww, but I want the cheetah!
Chilli: It’s not meant to be, kid.
Bluey: (sadly) Okay.
Bluey and Bingo waddle back inside.
Brandy: They’re beautiful.
Chilli: It’s been too long.
Brandy: I know… Look, Chilli.
Chilli: Yeah?
Bluey, now in a properly fitting zebra onesie, peeks back outside and takes Chilli's hand.
Bluey: Uh, Mum!
Bluey leads Chilli back inside in the entryway of the house and Brandy follows. Bingo, in the cheetah onesie, growling and making clawing motions with her hands. Bluey holds her arms to her chest as Chilli puts her arms around her.
Bluey: It’s happening again!
Chilli: Oh, no!
Brandy: What’s going on?
Bandit enters from another room.
Bandit: Hey! Brandy! How you-
Bandit screams as Bingo pins him to the ground, making scratching motions at his stomach.
Bluey: Run!
TITLE CARD - The two aforementioned onesie boxes, now open and empty. The zebra one is laid down on its front face, while the cheetah one is partially propped up by the other box.
Brandy : This episode of Bluey is called Onesies.
The scene cuts to Brandy, Chilli, and Bluey running down the porch steps and into the front yard. A brief glimpse of the doorway shows that Bandit is still being "clawed" in the foyer.
Brandy: I don’t understand what’s happening!
Chilli: No time to explain, we have to get to safety!
Brandy: But what about Bandit? (gestures behind her)
Chilli: Forget him, he’s done!
Bingo emerges from the house, harshly meowing and growling as she chases after Brandy, Chilli, and Bluey, who all scream.
Chilli: What do we do?
Bluey: The car!
Bluey points to the car as the group runs towards it. Bluey opens the front passenger door and climbs into the back, followed by Brandy, who takes the driver's seat, and Chilli, who takes the front passenger seat and slams the door behind her.
Brandy: Why has Bingo gone feral?
Bingo aggressively meows again as she slams against the car window, Chilli recoiling.
Bluey: Onesies make Bingo crazy.
Chilli: She sort of becomes one with the onesie.
Bingo continues to jump at the window.
Brandy: What?
Bingo seemingly disappears from the scene.
Bluey: Where’d she go?
Chilli: I don’t know!
The group looks out the windows to check, right before Bandit slams his palm against the driver's side window. The girls scream. Bandit looks disheveled as he pulls himself up, his breath slightly fogging the window.
Bandit: Did you.. get her.. the onesie?!
Brandy: I didn’t know, I’m sorry!
Bingo tackles a screaming Bandit back to the ground. Chilli flinches, back against the door. Brandy is holding the steering wheel for stability.
Bluey: Don’t worry, we can live in the car!
Chilli: Yeah, there’s plenty of food under the seats!
Brandy: Yeah, and we’ve got music!
As they converse, the door to the boot can be seen opening, Bingo's cheetah tail slowly wagging as it moves through the car, more of her bottom appearing over the top of the seat as if ready to pounce.
Bluey: Oh, yeah!
Chilli: Brandy, what was it that you wanted to say earlier?
Brandy: Uhh… Um...
Bingo, growling, springs up over the back seat, the rest of the girls screaming.
Chilli, Brandy, and Bluey: Get out!
Screaming, Chilli and Brandy each open their respective car door and run out. Bluey climbs out over her mum's lap. Bingo watches them through the car window with a snarl.
The scene cuts to the backyard, the group running towards the white shed as Bluey points at it.
Bluey: Let’s hide behind the shed!
Brandy peeks out past the side of the shed.
Brandy: I think we lost her!
The camera cuts to show the group hiding on a shadowed side of the shed, the adults crouched down to their knees. Chilli sighs in relief.
Bluey: Auntie Brandy, was there a medium size cheetah onesie at the shop?
Brandy turns back to Bluey as Chilli looks slightly disapproving. Bluey gives an innocent look with tilted hips.
Brandy: Um, I’m not sure, Bluey.
Chilli starts smiling again.
Bluey: Can you ring them and ask?
Chilli looks disapproving again.
Chilli: Bluey!
Bluey: What?
Brandy: Sorry, Bluey, the last time I saw you zebras were your favorite animal.
Bluey: They used to be, but I changed to cheetahs.
Chilli: Four years ago.
There's a slight dejected pause.
Brandy: Look, I have to go, this was a mistake.
Brandy gets to her feet.
Chilli: No, Brandy, I’m sorry, don’t go!
Brandy steps backwards back into the sunlight.
Brandy: Say goodbye to Bi-
Brandy screams as Bingo instantly tackles her.
Chilli and Bluey: Brandy!
Brandy: Run! Save yourselves!
Bingo "claws" at Brandy, who is giggling and happily playing along, trying to wrestle Bingo off of her and kicking her feet.
Chilli and Bluey run off, the scene transitioning to the Heeler's upstairs bathroom. The two stepping into the tub, Chilli helping Bluey up, and hiding inside by laying on their backs.
Chilli: I think we’re just going to have a no onesie policy from now on.
Bluey: Mum, why did Auntie Brandy want to leave? Is she sad? And why have we only seen her once in our lives?
Chilli: (exhales) You know how you really want Bingo’s cheetah onesie?
Bluey: Yeah, more than anything!
Chilli: But it doesn’t fit you, so you can’t have it, and there’s not really anything anyone can do to make it fit.
Bluey: (sadly) Yeah.
Chilli: Well…
The scene cuts to the backyard, where Brandy is still giggling and playing along with Bingo's attack. When Brandy manages to get Bingo off of her, she simply climbs back on top of her. 
Chilli: (off-screen) …there’s something Auntie Brandy wants more than anything as well, but she can’t have it, and there’s not really anything anyone can do about it.
Brandy lands on her side as Bingo escapes her grasp, running off as Brandy reaches out for her.
Bluey: Why can’t she just have the thing she wants?
Brandy rolls over onto her back, sad and silent.
Chilli: Because it’s not meant to be.
A Welcome Swallow is shown flying overhead.
The scene cuts to show Brandy still laying on her back in the yard as Chilli and Bluey peek out through the playroom.
Bluey: (whispering) There’s Brandy! Let’s see if she’s okay.
Bluey and Chilli cautiously sneak off of the playroom patio and into the yard.
Chilli: Yeah, she finally comes to visit and we let her get eaten by a cheetah!
Bluey: So rude!
Bingo growls deviously as she peeks out from behind the Poinciana tree once Bluey and Chilli leave the frame.
Brandy slightly rises from her back and tries to make a subtle pushing motion.
Brandy: (whisper-shouting) No! Go back! Go back!
Chilli: Huh?
Bluey: Is she shooing a fly?
Brandy: (whisper-shouting, still gesturing) Run!
Chilli and Bluey finally reach Brandy.
Bluey: Brandy, are you shooing a fly?
Brandy: (normal voice) Run, it’s a trap!
Chilli and Bluey: Huh?
Bingo shows up and tackles Chilli to the ground with a growl.
The group screams before Brandy and Chilli start giggling.
Chilli: Run, Bluey!
Bluey runs away screaming as Bingo frees Chilli and chases her instead.
Chilli and Brandy sigh, the former rolling onto her back. Bluey screaming and Bingo growling can still be heard in the background.
Brandy: I tried to warn you.
Chilli: We had to see if you were okay.
Brandy: Thanks, appreciate it!
Chilli: Are you okay?
Brandy: Yeah, I will be.
Bingo is growling and chasing Bluey up and down a slide in the background while Chilli and Brandy lay on the ground and talk.
Brandy: I’m sorry, Chilli.
Chilli: Oh, you couldn’t have known Bingo was bananas.
Brandy: No, I mean… I’m sorry it’s been so long.
Chilli: Oh.
Brandy: It’s just hard seeing you all. You know?
Chilli: I know.
Chilli holds Brandy’s hand and they both smile while looking at two clouds overhead.
Brandy: I'll tell you what: next time I come over, I’m not bringing any onesies.
They both smile at each other briefly before hearing Bluey cry out.
Bluey: Ahh, help!
The two sisters get to their feet.
Chilli: We have to help Bluey!
Brandy: Let’s do the dance!
Chilli: The one we did as kids?
Brandy: Yeah! Do you still remember the moves?
Chilli: Well, with your help I can.
Bluey is running away from Bingo, who is wearing a purple helmet with a pink butterfly pattern on top of her onesie and riding a bike (the same as the one from Bike).
Bluey screams as Bingo growls.
Bluey: Cheetahs can’t ride bikes!
Bingo crashes into the mailbox, pushing it forward, before abandoning the bike altogether. Bluey runs towards Bandit, who is laying behind the car and checking his phone, and hides behind him.
Bluey: Dad, help!
Bandit: I can’t, I’ve been eaten. Rules are rules.
Bluey: But Bingo’s gonna eat me!
Bandit: Well, zebras are pretty good dodgers.
Bluey: Oh, yeah, they are!
Bandit: You have to become one with your onesie.
Bluey holds her "hooves" up as she approaches Bingo, whinnying. 
Bingo growls and attempts to tackle Bluey, who quickly sidesteps out of the way. Bingo meows confused. This dodging continues until Bingo grabs Bluey's zebra tail. Bluey struggles to escape.
Chilli: (off-screen) Hey, Bingo!
The two pause to look. Bingo meows confused.
The camera cuts to show Chilli and Brandy, standing somewhat sideways on the porch steps and holding each other's hands.
Chilli: (to Brandy) Ready? 1, 2, 3.
Chilli and Brandy do the dance they used to do for their mum while laughing- first comes a set of small kicks, then they try to twist their arms over each other while still holding hands.
Bluey and Bingo look at each other, then smile and walk towards Chilli and Brandy.
Chilli: Yup, then this.
Chilli and Brandy sway their hips in the opposite direction of each other. They step off the porch steps and disconnect hands, holding their open palms by their ears as they sway their hips back and forth. 
Bluey and Bingo laugh then join in on the dance. Brandy attempts to start a different move, holding her arms out in front of her. Chilli laughs.
Chilli: No, no, no, hips first.
The two sisters put their hands to their hips, swaying them in a slightly circular motion.
Bluey and Bingo laugh as they switch to this move. Bingo is able to do it more accurately than earlier. Chilli takes Brandy's hands again and twirls her, causing Brandy to laugh.
Brandy: Chilli!
Bluey and Bingo are also shown doing the twirl move before all four switch back to the hips move as the episode ends. Bandit, still on his phone, behind the car, can be seen bobbing his head.
Starting at the "Animators" section of the credits, a Welcome Swallow flies in a weaving motion across the credits.
