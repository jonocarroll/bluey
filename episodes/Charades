The episode starts at the Gold Coast, where Chris's house is. The shot cuts inside Nana's house, where Bandit and Stripe have dropped off the kids Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, and Socks. Bluey is trying on her nana's glasses, Socks is playing with Nana's tail, and Muffin and Bingo are chasing after each other, orbiting around her. Bluey gives Nana her glasses back and joins the two.
Bandit: "Okay Mum, at least try and limit the amount of ice blocks to a reasonable number."
Nana: "Okay, got it."
Stripe: "Right, let's go."
Bandit: "See 'ya, kids! Be good to Nana."
Bluey Heeler, Bingo, Muffin Heeler: "Bye!"
Nana closes the door as the two exit. The kids look to her.
Bluey, Bingo, Muffin: "Ice blocks!"
Nana: "Yeah!"
The shot cuts outside the apartment, with all four children enjoying their ice blocks and Muffin holding Socks so she can eat hers.
Bluey: "Nana?"
Nana: "Yes, sweetie?"
Bluey: "Why do we get lots of ice blocks at your house, but hardly any when we're at our house?"
Nana: "Oh, well, that's a good question."
Bingo: "Finished! Can we play charades now?"
Bluey & Muffin: "Yeah!"
Socks: "Woof!"
EPISODE TITLE: Charades
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Charades!"
The shot cuts to Nana's apartment, where the all four grandchildren and Nana sit on the couch. Nana is sorting through the charade cards.
Muffin: "What's charades?"
Bluey: "It's easy, Muffin! First, you pick a card..."
Bingo: "But don't let anyone see it, okay?"
Muffin: "Okay!"
Socks: "Woof woof!"
Bluey: "Then, you look at the picture on it!"
The card shows a picture of a duck.
Bluey: "Okay, got it."
Muffin: "What's on the card?"
Bingo: "No, Muffin!"
Muffin: "I need to see it!"
Muffin gets up and tries to pull the card box out of Nana's hands. Bluey and Bingo panic while Socks barks playfully.
Nana: "Oh- uh, no sweetie. We don't look at it. Bluey's going to act it out!"
Bingo: "And then we guess what it is!"
Muffin: "Ohhh!"
Bluey runs in front of the table.
Bluey: "Okay, ready?"
Bingo, Nana and Muffin: "Ready!"
Bluey proceeds to act out being a duck, walking in circles.
Muffin: "Uhhh, eagle!"
Bluey: "No."
Nana: "Ohhh, it's a...bush turkey!"
Bingo: "Ibis!" 
Muffin: "Squiwwel!" 
Bluey: "Nope!"
Nana: "Brolga!" 
Bingo: "Chicken!"
Nana: "What about you, Socks?"
Socks whines, unable to guess.
Bingo: "Duck!"
Bluey: "Yeah!"
Bingo, Muffin, Nana: "Hooray!"
Nana: "Good one, Bingo!"
Bingo: "Ooh, my turn!"
Muffin: "I want a turn!"
Bingo and Muffin fight over the card box. Nana stops Muffin as they try to pull it away from each other.
Nana: "Maybe just watch one more, sweetie?"
Muffin: "Okay, nana!"
Nana: "Go on, Bingo, pick a card."
Bingo picks a ballerina card and squeals as she runs up. The shot shows us what the card is, and she sets it down after memorizing it.
Bingo: "Ooh, this is a good one. You ready?"
Bluey, Muffin, Nana: "Ready!"
Bingo proceeds to act out being a ballerina.
Nana: "Uhhh...circle!"
Bluey: "Donut!"
Bingo: "Nope."
Nana: "The sun!"
Muffin: "Squiwwel!"
Bingo: "Uh-uh!"
Muffin: "Chicken!"
Bingo: "Nope."
Bluey: "A dancer!"
Bingo: "Close!"
Nana: "Ooh, what do you think, Socks?"
Socks whines, again not being able to guess.
Muffin: "CHICKEN!"
Bluey: "I know! Ballerina!"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
Nana: "Hooray!"
Muffin: "Good one, Bluey!"
Socks whines, saddened by being unable to play properly.
Nana: "Oh, never mind, Socks."
Muffin: "It's my turn!"
Nana: "Okay, Muffin, your turn. Are you sure you know how to do it?"
Muffin: "Yes, I know."
Muffin runs up to the front, and Bingo goes to sit down.
Nana: "Pick a card. Okay now, take a look."
Muffin looks down at her card. She gets a frog card.
Nana: "Now act it out."
Muffin: "I don't want a frog card. I want the ballerina card!"
Nana: "Oh. Uhh...well..."
Bluey: "Muffin, you have to do the one on the card!"
Muffin: "BUT I WANT TO DO THE BALLERINA!"
Nana: "O-oh, okay! Bluey, why don't you look through the box for the ballerina card?"
Bluey: "Okay!"
Bluey looks through the card box.
Muffin: "Thanks, Bluey!"
Bluey: "...Hang on. Won't we know that Muffin is a ballerina?"
Nana: "Oh, y-yeah, but we'll play along for the littlies, okay?"
Bluey: "Oh, okay nana."
Nana: "Almost there, Muffin!"
Muffin: "Okay, nana!"
Bluey: "I can't find it!"
Muffin: "Keep looking!"
Bluey pulls a car card out.
Bluey: "What about a car?"
Bingo: "Ooh! Would you like to be a car, Muffin? You can do this!"
Bingo rolls on her back, attempting to emulate a car.
Muffin: "That's a squiwwel!"
Nana: "Give me those cards, Bluey."
Bluey: "That's not a car!"
Bingo: "Yeah it is!"
Bluey: "A car's like this."
Bluey mimics movement of a steering wheel.
Bingo: "That's a steering wheel."
Nana: "It must be in here somewhere..."
Muffin: "I don't want to be a car! I want to be a--"
Nana: "Ballerina!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Hooray!"
Nana: "There you go, Muffin."
She gives Muffin the ballerina card.
Muffin: "Thanks, nana!"
Nana: "Okay, off 'ya go."
Muffin stares at the card, an angry expression still plastered on her face.
Muffin: "I NEED A TUTU!"
Bluey and Bingo groan in annoyance, with Socks and Nana simply looking annoyed. Nana thinks of a quick solution.
Nana: "O-oh, um...Bluey! Go and check Nana's dress-up box for a tutu."
Bluey: "Okay!"
Bluey and Bingo run off to Nana's room.
Nana: "Quickly! She's going to blow her top."
The shot cuts to Bluey and Bingo in Nana's dress-up room. They look around in the box on the ground.
Bluey: "Ooh. Confetti." 
She rummages through the stuff.
Bluey: "Pirate...princess...-"
Bingo: "Tutu!"
The shot cuts back to the living room. Muffin waits impatiently, and Nana is petting Socks. Bluey and Bingo run in.
Bluey: "Here's the tutu, Muffin!"
Muffin: "Thanks, Bluey!"
Nana: "Oh, good one, girls!"
Bluey: "Put your legs through, Muffin!"
Muffin: "I'm trying!"
Bingo: "That's your arm!"
Bluey and Bingo help Muffin into her tutu.
Nana: "Push...Yeah, that's it!"
Bingo: "Push, push, Muffin!"
After some struggling they manage to get Muffin's tutu on.
Muffin: "Got it!"
Bluey, Bingo and Muffin: "Hooray!"
Nana: "Okay...off 'ya go!"
Muffin stands still for a brief moment, ready to act out a ballerina...
Muffin: "I need ballerina music!"
Bluey, Bingo and Nana groan in annoyance.
Bluey, Bingo: "Muffin!"
Nana: "How about I sing you some?"
She starts singing, only for Muffin to get angered.
Muffin: "NOOO!!!! IT NEEDS TO BE PROPER BALLERINA MUSIC!"
Bluey: "You don't need music, Muffin! You just need--"
Muffin: "I WANT MUSIC!!"
Bluey: "Okay!"
Nana: "O-oh, um...Oooh, I know. Bluey, Bingo, come with me!"
The shot cuts to Nana's bedroom, where she grabs a music box on the table.
Nana: "Did you know that I was given this music box by my nana?"
Bluey: "You mean you had a nana?"
Nana: "I did. A long time ago."
Bingo: "Hang on. We all know that Muffin is going to be a ballerina."
Nana: "Well yes, I guess we do."
Bingo: "But that's not the proper rules!"
Nana: "You're right, Bingo. But that's what Muffin wants."
Bingo: "I don't understand."
Nana: "Well, you know what? At Nana's house, I guess there's only one rule."
Bluey, Bingo: "What's that?"
Nana: "Everyone gets what they want."
Bluey & Bingo: "Oh yeah!"
The shot cuts back to the living room. Muffin waits impatiently and Socks staring nervously at her. Bluey, Bingo and Nana enter!
Bluey: "We got the music!"
Nana: "Okay. You ready, Muffin?"
Muffin: "Ready!"
Nana: "You ready, Socks?"
Socks: "Woof woof!"
Nana: "You ready, girls?"
Bluey & Bingo: "Ready, Nana!"
Nana: "Okay, let's go!"
Bluey: "Nana?"
Nana: "Yes, Bluey?"
Bluey: "Was your nana a nice nana?"
Nana looks down at the music box, a sincere smile on her face.
Nana: "She was about the nicest nana you would ever wanna meet, Bluey."
Nana opens the music box, and begins winding it to create sound. With the music going and the room falling silent, Muffin begins dancing.
Bingo: "Hey Nana? When she's finished, should we pretend that we didn't know what she was?"
Nana: "Good idea, Bingo!"
Bluey: "Cause we have to take care of the littlies." 
Nana: "That's right."
Muffin: "Shush!"
Nana smiles and continues playing the music box. Soon, the music comes to a close.
Bluey, Bingo, Nana: "Hooray! Good one, Muffin!"
They throw confetti and Muffin smiles.
Muffin: "Can you guess what I was?"
Bluey, Bingo and Nana:' "Uhh...any idea, girls? What was Muffin...?"
Socks: "Ballerina!"
Muffin: "Yes!"
Bluey, Bingo, Nana: "Hooray! Good one, Socks!"
The episode pans out, showing the outside sunset as the children laugh laugh and Socks barking.
