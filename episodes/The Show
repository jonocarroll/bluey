The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler's house in the early morning.
Cut to Bandit and Chilli's bedroom. Jacaranda flowers slowly fall onto the balcony. Chilli is asleep in bed. Bingo enters, carrying a tray of pancakes. Bluey follows with a vase of flowers, and Bandit comes in behind the kids.
Bluey, Bingo: "Happy Mother's Day!"
Chilli blinks her eyes open and sits up - right as Bingo trips, spilling breakfast on the floor.
Chilli: "Oh! Goodness!"
Bingo gets up and runs out of the room.
Chilli: "Oh, Bingo!"
Bluey runs after her.
Bluey: "Come back!"
Bandit awkwardly rubs his neck.
Bandit: "Yeah, I thought that might happen."
Cut to Bluey and Bingo's bedroom. Bingo is curled up in the bottom of a cupboard. Bluey sits outside it, comforting her. Chilli enters and sits down on the floor next to them.
Chilli: "Are you okay, Bingo?"
Bluey: "She's sad because she thinks she ruined your day."
Chilli: "It'll take more than that to ruin my day, Bingo."
Bingo: "I ruin everything."
Chilli: "These things happen, honey. I'll tell you what I do. Bluey, checklist."
Bluey: "Ooh, okay."
Bluey pretends to hold a notepad and pen.
Chilli: "I have a little cry. Mwaa"
Chilli rubs at her eyes as though she's crying. Bluey pretends to write a check in her notebook.
Bluey: "Check."
Chilli: "Then, I pick myself up..."
Chilli stands. Bluey checks off another item.
Bluey: "Check."
Chilli: "...dust myself off..."
She pretends to brush dust off her front. Bluey checks off another item.
Bluey: "Check."
Chilli: "...and keep going. The show must go on."
Bluey: "Oooh!"
Bluey, struck by inspiration, runs out of the room. Bingo hasn't cheered up at all.
Bingo: "The only one of those I know how to do is the crying one."
Chilli kneels down and pats Bingo on the knee.
Chilli: "Then just do that one for now."
Bluey runs back in, holding a field hockey stick.
Bluey: "Bingo, let's put on a show!"
Bingo immediately perks up.
Bingo: "Okay!"
TITLE CARD - The Show
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: The Show."
Cut to Bandit and Chilli's bedroom. Bingo, acting as usher, leads Chilli and Bandit to the bed, and directs them to sit.
Bingo: "Please take your seat."
She hands them a pair of hand-drawn playbills.
Bingo: "The show is about to start!"
She giggles and runs out to the balcony, where Bluey is waiting. They both clench their fists and dance from foot to foot in silent excitement.
Chilli: "Oh, it's so nice to go to the theater."
Bandit pulls out a pair of opera glasses made out of some paper 3d glasses and a pencil.
Bandit: "Oh yes, I've heard very good things about this production."
Cut to the parents perspective. The wide doorway frames the balcony like a theater stage. Bluey enters from stage left, and stands center stage.
Bluey: "Welcome to the show."
Bingo runs across the stage from stage left and exits stage right, giggling. Bluey follows, and pulls her out of the wings.
Bluey: "Bingo, quick, this side!"
They both run across the stage and exit stage left.
Bandit and Chilli clap. Bluey leans into the room and flicks a switch, shutting off the house lights.
Cut to the balcony. Bluey and Bingo are in the wings, out of view of the bedroom, setting up for the first scene.
Bluey: "Bingo, you're gonna play Mum, 'cause you're both red."
Bluey holds the field hockey stick out to Bingo.
Bingo: "I promise my best, I won't ruin it, Bluey."
Bingo takes the stick.
Bluey: "You won't, now go!"
Bluey shoves Bingo on stage.
Bingo: "Aah!"
Cut to the parents' perspective. After a moment of hesistation, Bingo smiles widely and begins to strut across the stage.
Bingo: ♫ "Doo doo doo-doo" ♫
Chilli gasps and puts her hand on Bandit's shoulder.
Chilli: "It's me!"
Bluey leans in from stage left.
Bluey: "One day... Uh, wait on."
Bingo freezes, mid-strut.
Bluey: (stage whisper) "What's your not-Mum name?"
Chilli: (stage whisper) "Chilli!"
Bluey: "Oh, yeah." 
Bingo resumes walking across the stage.
Bluey: "One day, Chilli was walking along, and, um, this was before she was a mum, in the olden days."
Bingo stops and stands proudly. Bandit laughs, Chilli looks unamused.
Bluey: "Chilli loved playing hockey..."
Bingo pretends to make a shot, then freezes.
Bluey: "...and, um..."
Chilli: (stage whisper) "Dancing."
Bluey: "Oh, yes, and dancing."
Bluey reaches into the room and presses a button on a boom box. Dance music starts to play. Bingo starts to dance, holding the hockey stick over her head.
Chilli: "Ooh, I'm a good dancer."
Bluey: "But..."
Bluey turns off the music. Bingo stops dancing.
Bluey: "...she was very lonely."
Bingo: "No I wasn't."
Chilli: "Yeah, no, I wasn't."
Bluey: "Yes, you were." 
Bluey ducks into the wings.
Bluey: (off stage) "So... she..."
Bluey steps halfway back onstage.
Bluey: "Um, where did you meet Dad?"
Chilli: "Well, there's some dispute..."
Bandit shakes his head slightly.
Chilli: "...but let's just say, at a party. In London."
The camera suddenly zooms in on Bluey and Bingo. Their eyes get big and shiny. They squeal, tails wagging frantically.
Later, the girls have set up their vision of a London party. Bingo and a plush dog with a crown - presumably playing the part of Queen Elizabeth II - sit at the mushroom-patterned table and chairs. A slice of cake with candles on it sits in the center of the table. Bingo sips a cup of tea.
Bingo: "Blow out your candles, Your Majesty."
Bingo: (as the Queen) "Very well."
Chilli: "I don't remember the Queen being there."
Bandit rolls his eyes.
Bandit: "You wouldn't."
Bluey: "Then, suddenly, this big blue guy called, um..."
Bandit: "Bandit."
Bluey: "...Bandit, walked in."
Bandit looks through his opera glasses and elbows Chilli.
Bandit: "Alright, here we go!"
Bluey enters, wearing an Australian flag as a cape, with a finger up her nose.
Bluey: (low pitched) ♫ "Doo-doo-doot dee doh." ♫
Bluey: (low pitched) "Hey, babe, shmell this."
Bluey points her bum at Bingo, raises a leg, and blows a raspberry.
Bandit: "What?!"
Chilli chuckles and claps a few times.
Chilli: "Spot on."
Bluey blows a few more raspberries. Bingo strokes the tip of Bluey's tail.
Bingo: "Ooh, delightful."
Bingo: (as the Queen) "Yes, jolly good."
Bingo and Bluey laugh. Bandit angrily pages through the playbill.
Bandit: "Who wrote this?!"
Chilli chuckles again. The scene cuts back to the parents' point of view, showing the stage is now empty.
Bluey: (off stage) "And then..."
Bluey and Bingo enter, wearing backpacks.
Bluey: "...Bandit asked Chilli to marry him, on a romance trip to, um..."
Bandit: "Italy!"
Bluey: "The dump!"
Bingo laughs.
Bandit: "What?!"
Bluey gets down on one knee.
Bluey: (low pitched) "Ooh, marry me, babe!"
Bingo: "Why should I?"
Bluey: (low pitched) "Cause I love you, babe. I love your ears, babe."
Bluey giggles.
Bingo: "Do you love my stinky feet?"
Bluey nuzzles Bingo's foot.
Bluey: "Oh, yeah, I loves your stinky feet."
Bingo: "And my belly button?"
Bluey: "Oh, yeah, I loves your belly button, babe."
Bluey blows a raspberry on Bingo's stomach. Bingo giggles.
Bandit: "That is not how it happened!"
Chilli leans up against Bandit, embracing her hubby's arm as she is delighted by the adorable moment.
Chilli: (touched) "Oh, yes it was."
A moment later, Bluey, wearing a bow tie, stands hand-in-hand with Bingo, holding a bouquet. Bluey throws a handful of jacaranda flowers.
Bluey: "They had a big wedding. And then... come on, Bingo."
Bluey and Bingo exit to stage right.
Bandit: "Is this a toilet break?"
Bluey: (offstage) "No."
Cut to the balcony. Bluey and Bingo are in the wings, setting up the next scene. They have an open toy chest with dress-up props. Bluey blows up a blue balloon, while Bingo puts on a green tee shirt.
Bingo: (excited) "Bluey, I haven't ruined the show yet!"
Bluey: "Good one, Bingo."
Chilli: (to Bandit) "Well, I'm enjoying this very much."
Bandit: "I have some minor quibbles with Act 1, but me too."
Cut back to the Audience's perspective. Bluey and Bingo enter from stage right. Bingo now has the balloon stuffed up her shirt, making her look pregnant.
Bluey: "And then Chilli had a baby in her belly."
Chilli: "Aww!"
Bluey lifts the edge of the shirt and points at the balloon.
Bluey: "It's me!"
Bluey giggles. Chilli smiles and gives her a double thumbs-up.
Bluey: "How are you doing in there, little mate?"
Bluey tickles the balloon. Bingo thrusts the balloon forward, bouncing Bluey back a step.
Bingo: "Kick!"
Bluey: "Ooh!"
Bluey and Bingo laugh. So do Bandit and Chilli.
Bluey slams her stomach into the balloon, knocking Bingo back a step. Bingo slams Bluey again, and Bluey slams her back.
Bandit: "Okay, let's keep this moving."
Bluey: "So then they..."
The balloon pops. Bluey and Bingo look at the shreds of balloon on the floor. Then Bluey looks up at Bingo.
Cut to Bandit and Chilli. They keep their faces neutral. Bandit reaches out and takes Chilli's hand.
Bingo scrunches her eyes closed and runs off to stage right.
Bluey: "Bingo!"
She turns to the audience.
Bluey: "Ladies and gentlemen, we're just having some... show problems. Please, uh, enjoy some dance."
She grabs Chattermax from offstage and sets him down. He begins to to dance and babble.
Bandit: "Aw, no!"
Bandit looks at Chattermax, nonplussed. Chilli sadly looks at Chattermax for a moment, before staring off into the distance.
In the wings, Bingo sits up against the side of the house, holding her knees.
Bluey: "Bingo, what are you doing? Get back out here."
Bingo: "I knew I'd ruin the show."
Bandit's hands snatch Chattermax into the bedroom, mercifully silencing him.
Bluey: "It wasn't your fault!"
Bingo: "It was."
Bluey picks up the packet of balloons.
Bluey: "We can just blow up another one. Oh, there's no blue ones left."
Bingo: "Ohh, I ruin Mother's Day every day."
Bluey pulls out a green balloon.
Bluey: "There's green!"
Bingo: "But you're not green."
Bluey: "I don't mind."
Bluey drops the balloon and picks up the Queen.
Bluey: "Ooh! I know. Let's stuff the Queen up there."
Bluey lifts the bottom of Bingo's shirt. Bingo pulls it back down.
Bingo: "But she's an old lady."
Bluey: (as the Queen) "How rude."
Bandit sticks his head out on to the balcony.
Bandit: "Hey, um..."
Bluey: "Aah! No! Get back to your seat!"
Bluey starts shoving Bandit back into the bedroom.
Bandit: "I have to go to the toilet!"
Bluey: "Sit down."
Bandit:"Hey! Hey!"
Bluey, shoving Bandit back into the room, exits. Bingo sits all alone on the balcony for a moment. Then Bluey comes back out.
Bluey: "Listen, Bingo, we're finishing this show."
Bingo: "I can't. Just do it by yourself."
Cut to a wider shot, including Bandit and Chilli.
Bluey: "We can't do the show without you. You're Mum!"
Bandit puts his hand on Chilli's back, and she puts her hand on his knee. They look at each other lovingly.
Cut back to a close shot of Bingo and Bluey. Bingo sniffs and rubs at her nose. Then she straightens up.
Bingo: "Bluey, checklist."
Bluey: "Ooh! Okay, go."
Bluey pretends to hold a notepad and pen. Bingo rubs at her eyes."
Bingo: "Have a cry."
Bluey: "Check!"
Bluey makes a check. Bingo hugs herself and stands.
Bingo: "Pick myself up."
Bluey: "Check."
Bluey makes a check. Bingo pretends to brush off dust.
Bingo: "Dust myself off."
Bluey: "Check."
Bingo picks up the field hockey stick.
Bingo: "And keep going."
Bluey: "The show must go on."
Bingo: "Check."
Bandit and Chilli look into each other's eyes and smile.
Bluey and Bingo re-enter from stage right. Bingo drops the tee shirt on the floor as she enters.
Bluey: "She's back!"
Bandit and Chilli applaud.
Bandit, Chilli: "Hooray! Whoo whoo whoo!"
Bandit, Chilli: (chanting) "Chilli! Chilli! Chilli! Chilli!"
Bingo walks into the bedroom, pulls Bandit off the bed with the field hockey stick, and ushers him onto the stage as Chilli laughs.
Bandit: "What? Hey, hey, what?"
Bingo prods him with the hockey stick, forcing him to exit, stage right.
Bandit: (offstage) "Save my seat."
Bluey: "So, um..."
Bandit: (offstage) "Hey, what are you doing?"
Bluey stares offstage as she continues attempting to narrate.
Bluey: "...what was happening was..."
Bandit: (offstage) "Hold on--No! No! No!" 
Props are from stage right as Bandit and Bingo struggle off stage. Bluey laughs.
Bandit: (offstage) "No way. Ow!"
Bluey: "Oh, yeah! Chilli went to hospital, and..." 
Bluey: (whispering) "Are you ready?"
Bandit: (off stage) "No!"
Chilli leans forward in anticipation.
Chilli: "Yes!"
Bluey: "She had a baby girl."
Bingo prods Bandit onstage. He's wearing a pink baby bonnet and nappy, sucking on a dummy, and holding a rattle and teddy bear.
Chilli sputters and bursts out laughing. Bluey and Bingo laugh too. Bandit spits out the dummy.
Bandit: (deadpan) "Goo-goo-gah-gah."
Bluey and Bingo laugh some more.
Bingo: "I'm going to call her Bluey."
Bluey: "That's me!"
Bandit: "Ah, yeah, I'm you, aren't I? Let's see..." 
Bandit: (mockingly) "Daddy, me go boom-boom in nappy."
Bandit blows a very loud raspberry. Bluey and Bingo squeal and giggle. He starts to chase Bluey around, bum-first.
Bandit: (mockingly) "Change me, Daddy!"
He blows some more raspberries. Bluey and Bingo keep laughing, and Chilli joins in.
Bluey: "Aaaaaaaah!"
Still screaming, Bluey runs through the bedroom and out into the hall. Bandit chases her, still blowing raspberries.
Bandit: (mockingly) "Dada, change me!"
Bingo bows.
Bingo: "The end."
Chilli claps.
Chilli: (touched) "Again."
A slow tune featuring bass and bassoon plays as Bluey dances.
