The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heelers' house.
Cut to the play room. A close up shows Bingo placing the final domino in a domino run. The camera pulls back to show the shape of the completed run - a love heart. Bingo proudly inspects her creation.
Bingo: "There."
Chilli walks in from the back yard, carrying a basket of laundry.
Chilli: "Wackadoo! Did you set up all those dominoes?"
Bingo: "Yeah. It's for Dad. It's a love heart."
Chilli: "Aww, 'cause you love your Dad."
Bingo: "Yeah."
Bingo steps gingerly over her domino run as she leaves the room.
Bingo: "I'm gonna let him knock over the first domino."
Cut to the kitchen.Bandit stands at the breakfast bar, typing on his phone, looking mildly annoyed. Bingo runs up to him.
Bingo: "Dad, come with me!"
Bandit keeps typing.
Bandit: "Okay, hang on, kid."
Bingo pulls on his tail.
Bingo: "Come on!"
Bandit: "I've just got to type this work e-mail."
Bingo keeps tugging.
Bingo: "Come on, Dad!
The cellphone rings.
Bandit: "Bingo, let go, mate."
Bandit answers the phone. He tries to wave Bingo away with his free hand. Bingo keeps tugging on his tail.
Bandit: (to phone) "Hey, look, I'll just explain it."
Bingo: (talking over Bandit) "I just want to show you something. Come on!"
Cut to Bingo's point of view. Bandit turns around to look at her.
Bandit: (emphatically) "Bingo, let go!"
Cut to Bandit's point of view. Bingo, looking stunned, lets go of his tail.
Bandit: (to phone) "Sorry, sorry."
Bingo slumps and looks at the floor.
Bandit: (to phone) "You need to give me four, not five."
Bingo walks sadly out of the room.
Bandit: "No. Uh yeah, we've already got one of those."
Cut to the playroom. Bingo walks in, and sits down next to her domino run. She sadly reaches out and knocks over a domino, triggering the whole run.
Cut to the living room. Bluey sits on the arm of the couch, kicking her legs as she reads a book. Bandit walks in.
Bandit: "Hey, kid. Have you seen Bingo?"
Bluey spots something behind Bandit.
Bluey: "Aah! Dad, your tail!"
Bandit: "Huh? What?"
Bandit turns around. His tail is bound up with half a dozen hair ties.
Bluey: "It's been braided!"
Bandit points at Bluey.
Bandit: "So's yours!"
Bluey turns around - she also has some hair ties on her tail.
Bluey: "Aah!"
The camera pulls back to reveal Chilli has been standing just off screen. She's presenting her tail, which is also decked with hair ties.
Chilli: "Mine too!"
Bluey, Bandit: "Aah!"
Bandit: "You know what this means?"
Bluey: "What?"
Bandit and Chilli grab Bluey protectively. They look around in mock fright.
Bandit, Chilli: "We've got fairies!"
Bluey gasps with delight.
TITLE CARD - Fairies
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Fairies"
Cut to the garage. Bluey and Bingo look excited. Chilli stands behind them, field hockey stick held as a weapon. The hair ties have been removed.
Chilli: "I can't believe they're back."
The camera pulls back slightly, bringing Bandit into the frame. He's wearing a welding mask and holding a cricket bat. He hands another, plastic cricket bat to Bluey, and then holds up a piece of paper. Cut to a close up - it's a piece of notebook paper, with a cartoon pen drawing of a fairy on it. The fairy has butterfly wings, a tiara, and a magic wand with a star on it.
Bandit: "All right. This is a fairy. If you see one, whack it."
He taps the paper with his cricket bat for emphasis.
Bluey: But they're invisible."
Bingo: "You have to look for fairies with your heart."
Bandit: "My heart says they're under here!"
Bandit lowers the visor of his welding mask, winds up, and swings at a pile of stuff under a tarp. It falls onto the floor, revealing it was some old painting supplies, a bottle of spray lubricant, and a jug of turpentine. He raises his helmet to look.
Bandit: "Ah, it's just turps."
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bluey: "Maybe they've gone."
Chilli: "Aah! Bluey, your bottom!"
Bluey turns around - her bottom is covered in stickers.
Bluey and Bingo: "Aaah!"
Bingo turns around and points at Chilli.
Bingo: "Aah! Mum!"
The camera pans back over to Chilli who now has a trio of clothespins stuck to the hair under her chin.
Bingo: "You've got a peg beard!"
Chilli: "Aaaah!"
Bluey: "What are we gonna do?"
Bandit: "That's it."
He throws down the cricket bat and takes off the mask, putting it on a table.
Bandit: "It's time to step this up a notch."
He walks offscreen.
Cut to the back yard. Bluey, Chilli, and Bingo stand outside the shed, while Bandit rattles around inside. Bluey and Chilli look worried. Bluey looks to Bingo, who just shrugs.
A moment later, Bandit comes out of the shed, carrying a pair of crab pots.
Bandit: "Let's do this."
Chilli: (skeptically) "Crab pots?"
Bandit: "If they can catch crabs, they can catch fairies."
A cellphone rings.
Bandit: "Huh?"
Bluey: "It's your phone."
Bandit feels around his torso.
Bandit: "Where's it gone?"
Bingo points behind her.
Bingo: "Over there."
Cut to a close-up of Bandit's phone, laying on the lawn in the center of a circle of stones and flowers. It's ringing and slowly moving as it vibrates. The caller ID shows Rocko is calling.
Bluey runs up.
Bluey: "I'll get it!"
Bandit, Chilli: "Bluey! Stop!"
Bluey steps into the circle. She immediately starts dancing a jig in a circle around the phone.
Bluey: "Aaah!" I can't stop dancing!"
Bluey and Bingo giggle as the rest of the family runs up to the circle.
Chilli: "It's a fairy ring. If you step inside, you dance and dance until you drop!"
Bandit: "Oh, no! I'll see if I can knock her out with Bingo."
Chilli: "Yeah! Like marbles!"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bandit picks Bingo up, grunting. He swings her forward. She lands inside the circle, knocking Bluey out of it. Bluey stops dancing. A moment later, Bingo starts dancing her own jig around the phone.
Bingo: (laughing) "I can't stop dancing!"
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: "Why did I think that would work?"
Chilli holds out her hockey stick into the circle. Bandit braces it with both hands.
Chili: "Bingo! Grab on!"
Chilli, Bandit, and Bingo grunt as they pull. They get Bingo out, falling on their bums as they do.
Chilli, Bandit, Bingo, Bluey: "Hooray!"
Bluey: "Oh, no! Look!"
The camera pulls back to reveal that the yard is covered in fairy rings, containing electronics or toys. They're all active - the tablets are playing videos, Chilli's phone rings, and Chattermax babbles. The Heelers scream and run inside.
Cut to the interior of the pantry. The Heelers huddle inside. Chilli wields an uncooked lasagna noodle as a weapon.
Chilli: "We need a change of plan!"
Bandit: "Let's call the police!"
Bluey: "Your phone's in the fairy ring."
Chilli: "We need to give the fairies what they want."
Bluey: "Yeah, then they'll leave us alone."
Bandit: "What?! I'm not rewarding naughty behavior."
Bluey: "Aah! Dad, your hands!"
Bandit: "Huh?"
He raises his hands into frame. They have been laced into a pair of child-sized roller skates.
Bandit: "Aaah!"
Bluey and Bingo giggle. Bandit growls.
Bandit: "Grrr, little ratbags!"
Bluey: "But what do the fairies want?"
Chilli: (pointedly) (to Bandit) "Maybe one of us hurt the fairies feelings?"
Bluey: "And now they're causing mischief."
Bandit attempts to punctuate his speech with sarcastic air quotes, but his hands are still trapped in the skates.
Bandit: (to Chilli) "Well, if that's true, how would this 'one of us' go about trying to fix things with 'the fairies?'"
Chilli: "Hmm. Bingo, are you brave enough to go and look for clues to what the fairies might want?"
Bingo: "I am!"
Bingo giggles and runs out of the pantry.
As soon as the door closes again, Bandit farts loudly. Bluey hurriedly scoots away from him, holding her nose.
Bluey: "Aaah! Dad!"
Chilli: "Oh, Bandit, really?
Chilli leans away, pinching her nose. Bluey coughs and then tries to hold her breath.
Bandit: "It was the fairies!"
Outside the pantry, Bingo holds herself flat against the wall, and looks around cautiously. Seeing the coast is clear, she runs off.
Back inside the pantry, Bluey grunts in frustration as she struggles to untie the skates from Bandit's hands.
Bandit: "Come on, Bluey. Get 'em off!"
Bluey: "I'm trying! The fairies used a triple knot."
Chilli: "Bingo's been gone for ages."
Bluey: "Maybe she's found a clue."
The door opens. All three start, and Chilli raises her lasagna noodle threateningly.
Bandit, Bluey, Chilli: "Aah!"
Bingo stands at the door, panting.
Bingo: "Come quickly!"
Cut to the sitting room. As the Heelers walk down the stairs, they see the room has been trashed by the fairies. Photos of Chilli have been turned upside-down, and photo of Bluey has been dressed with a tie. A pair of potted plants have been turned into "gum trees" with sticks of chewing gum and gumballs. A show has been hung from the ceiling on a rope made of shoelaces, with an action figure riding in it. A dozen thongs form a trail of footsteps across the wall. Bones have been stuck in the bone-shaped cutouts in the transom woodwork. Stuffed koalas hang from the falls, and a trail of fairy bred leads down the banister. The couch has been turned into a "car" with the addition of record "wheels" and saucer "headlights". A photo of Bandit, defaced with angry eyebrows, moustache, and jagged teeth sits in the driver's seat.
Bandit, Chilli, Bluey: "Oooh."
Several items are shown in close-up - the action figure riding in a shoe; a koala hanging from a gum tree, the photos on the wall.
Cut back to the room. Bingo leads them to the door to the outside, where the fairies have drawn Bandit on the glass.
Bingo: "Look! It's a message from the fairies."
Cut to a close-up of the drawing.
Bluey: "It's a picture of Dad, dancing 'round our letterbox."
Bandit: "Hey, why have I got stink lines coming off me?"
Bluey: (amused) "The fairies must think you stink."
Bandit: "What?!"
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Chilli: "I think they want you to fairy dance around our letterbox."
Bandit: "What? I'm not doin' that!"
Bandit folds his arms.
Bluey: "Dad! You have to!"
Bandit: "No way."
He shakes his roller-skated fist at the sky.
Bandit: "Do your worst, fairies! I'm not scared of you!"
Bandit winces, expecting retribution from the fairies.
Bandit: "Eee!"
After a moment, he opens an eye, then relaxes.
Bandit: (smugly) "Ha! See? Nothing."
The camera pulls back to show Bingo. She has been frozen in place, with her mouth gaping open and both fingers up her nose.
Bluye: "Bingo!"
Chilli: "Aaah! The fairies have frozen Bingo!"
Bluey, Chilli, and Bandit gasp.
Bluey points at Bandit.
Bluey: "Because of you!"
Bandit shakes his fist at the sky, then falls to his knees.
Bandit: "Curse you, fairies!"
Chilli: "Well. You know what you have to do."
Bandit: "Oh, no."
Bluey: "Hee-hee! I'll get the speaker!"
Bluey runs off.
Cut to the front yard. The Heelers come down the front walk; Bluey holding a bluetooth speaker, Chilli carrying Bingo, and Bandit, still wearing the roller skates on his hands. People chatter and laugh from offscreen.
Bandit: "Oh, man!"
Cut to a view of the cul-de-sac. Lucky and Rusty are playing cricket in the street, using a wheelie bin as the wicket. Pat and Wendy stand in the street, chatting. Judo, Bentley, and Zara play hopscotch on the other side of the street.
Bandit: "There's people everywhere!"
Cut back to the Heelers.
Pat: (off screen) "Nice roller skates, Bandit!"
Pat laughs obnoxiously. Bandit growls.
Chilli: "This isn't about you. You have to break the fairies' spell."
Chilli sets Bingo down on the walk.
Bandit: "Okay. One thing first."
Bandit kneels down in front of Bingo.
Bandit: "Hey, frozen Bingo. If I've ever hurt your feelings, I'm really sorry, mate. Must feel really bad when your dad does that. Just know that I love you, kid, and I'd do anything for you."
Bandit stands back up.
Bandit: "Right. Let's do this!"
Chilli, Bluey: "Yeah!"
Chilli presses play on her phone. A rendition of John Ryan's Polka (which has also been the episode theme) begins to play.
Chilli: "Go!"
Bandit begins an Irish step dance, circling around the letterbox.
Cut to the cul-de-sac. Pat and Wendy cease their conversation, staring at Bandit. Rusty turns and stares too, letting Lucky's ball go by without swinging.
Cut to an overhead shot. The other kids turn to watch as well as Chilli and Bluey laugh and cheer.
Chilli: "Whoa! Yeah!
Bluey: "Yeah!"
Bluey: "Go, Dad!"
Chilli: "You can do it!"
Bandit: "I am the Lord of the Dance!"
Bingo begins to move slightly, trying to tug a finger out of her nose.
Bluey, Chilli: "It's working!"
Bluey: "Keep dancing!"
Chilli: "Don't stop!"
Bandit: "Is this what you want, fairies?!"
Grunting with effort, Bingo pulls a finger out of her nose. She starts to bounce in time to the music.
Chilli: "Ooh! There's a hand!"
Bandit: "Are you not entertained?!"
Bingo starts to tug on her other hand.
Bluey, Chilli: "Ohh... ohh..."
Bingo: (grunting) "Errrah!"
She pulls her other finger free, falling down.
Bluey, Chilli, Bandit: "Bingo!"
Pat, Wendy, Rusty, Lucky, Judo, Zara, Bentley: "Hooray!"
Bandit: "Yeah!"
He flings the skates off his hands and picks up Bingo. He spins her around as he continues to dance. The Heelers all laugh.
Bluey and Chilli make eye contact, then Bluey sets down the speaker. They join Bandit and Bingo in dancing around the letterbox.
Bluey: "Whoo!"
Chilli: "Go, Bingo!"
The camera pulls back, showing the kids and Pat dancing in the street, as Wendy claps rhythmically. Everybody cheers.
Cut to the back yard. The Heelers are sitting in the grass, laughing. Chilli holds a hairbrush.
Chilli: "What a day!"
She resumes brushing Bluey's tail.
Bluey: "Yeah, I'm glad the fairies got what they wanted."
Bandit: "Me too."
He tousles Bingo's hair. She giggles.
Bingo: "Ooh, can we play Spotlight?"
Bandit: "Yep, go and get the torch."
Bingo: "Yeah!"
She runs into the house.
Cut to the playroom. Bingo runs in, squealing excitedly. She stops at the rug.
Bingo: "Hey, who set up my dominoes again?"
The camera pulls back, showing that the love heart domino run has been rebuilt.
A translucent purple fairy, resembling a tiny dog with huge, pointy ears and dragonfly wings swoops in, carrying one last domino.
Bingo gasps. The fairy lands, and places the last piece. It looks up at Bingo.
Bingo gasps again.
Bingo: "Dad!"
Bandit runs up, standing behind her.
Bandit: "What is it, Bingo?"
Bingo: "Look."
Bandit: "Oh, wow."
He puts his hand on her shoulder.
Bandit: "It's a love heart!"
John Ryan's Polka plays a final time over the episode credits as Bluey dances.
