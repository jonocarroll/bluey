The episode starts out at the park. There appears to be a cookout going on. There's a long line of hungry dogs waiting for sausages. Mackenzie's Dad can be seen with a dog with a cap and Cornelius at a grill, getting sausages. Marcus can be seen talking to Mackenzie's mum. We cut to show Bandit, Chilli, Bluey and Bingo walking through a field with many colourful signs planted on the grass.
Bingo: Ooh, mushrooms. 
Bingo runs off until she finds some mushrooms. She crouches down to try and touch the mushrooms.
Bandit: Hey, don't touch those, mate. They might be dodgy.
Bingo: Awh. 
Bingo walks back to the others sadly while looking at the mushroom. We cut to a shot of Bluey walking while looking at all the signs.
Bluey: Why are these signs in the park? 
Chilli: It's voting day. 
Bingo runs back quickly to the group. She happily takes Bandit's paw. 
Bingo: What's voting day? 
Chilli gestures to the signs.
Chilli: We have to pick one of these people to be the boss. 
Bingo: Oh, okay. 
Bluey points to one of the signs.
Bluey: Oh, don't pick that one, I don't like his smile. 
Bingo points to another one of the signs.
Bingo: Pick her, she's got earrings. 
Chilli: You don't vote for someone based on what they look like. You vote for who will be the best boss.
Bluey: How do you be the best boss?
Bandit: Well, I guess you tell everyone what to do, but in the best way.
Bingo looks down at the grass sadly.
Bingo: Ugh, I hate being told what to do.
Bandit looks down at Bingo.
Bandit: I know mate, but sometimes you just have to...
Mackenzie's voice cuts Bandit off. We cut to a further shot where Honey, Mackenzie and Coco can be seen.
Mackenzie: Hey Bluey! Come and play circus!
Bluey and Bingo stretch their arms out excitedly. Bandit and Chilli look down at them happily.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray, circus!
The title card is shown. This episode of Bluey is called: Circus. Underneath the title is two seed pods.
Bingo: (narrating) This episode of Bluey is called: Circus.
We cut to a line to buy food. In the line, Marcus, Mackenzie's mum, a man with yellow fur, Bella and Cornelius, who has two sausages that have tomato sauce on top in his paws. Chilli can be seen talking to Daisy. Mackenzie's Dad is with Bandit at the grill, cooking and preparing sausages. Bandit is furiously wagging his tail as he liberally applies tomato sauce to his sausage.
Chilli: Look, if we don't sort out the dogpark situation, they're never gonna get re-elected.
We pan to the left to reveal Bluey, Bingo, Coco, Honey and Mackenzie in a circle made out of seed pods.
Bluey: Okay, what is everyone?
Honey: I'll be a circus lion!
Honey gets down on all fours.
Honey: And I want to run away back to the jungle.
All five pups put their arms up.
Everyone: Yeah!
Mackenzie: Then I'll be the lion tamer, but I'm really mean, and that's why you wanna run away.
They put their arms up again. Bluey, Bingo, Coco and Honey look atMackenzie as they do.
Everyone: Yeah!
Coco: And I'll be the acrobat, and I'm married to the lion tamer!
Everyone: Yeah!
Mackenzie realises what Coco had said.
Mackenzie: Wait, what?
Bingo: I'll be the audience, and this is popcorn!
She picks up some bumpy looking plants from the grass. Bluey picks up a stick.
Bluey: And I'll be the ringmaster! I tell everyone what to do!
Bingo walks up to Bluey.
Bingo: Yeah, but, I'm the audience. So you can't tell me what to do.
Bluey: Oh yeah.
Mackenzie: Let's start.
Everyone: Yeah!
Bingo: Wait, I need more popcorn.
Bingo starts to pick up more of the same bumpy plant from before. Mackenzie stomps his foot and looks down at the grass, annoyed.
Mackenzie: Ugh, not again!
We pan over to another section of the field. A sand pit can be seen nearby. Winton can be seen laying on the grass with a sad look on his face. A big St. Bernard kid runs around, imitating an engine revving as he does. This is Hercules. He runs over towards Winton and jumps over him, then he runs off while still imitating an engine revving. 
Winton: Hercules, can I have a turn as a motorbike yet?
Hercules: No, you're my jump.
Hercules puts his arms back up in the motorbike position.
Winton: But being a jump is boring.
Hercules puts his arms akimbo.
Hercules: Just do as you're told or you're not playing, okay?
Winton: Okay.
Winton sadly lays back down on the grass. Hercules starts to imitate an engine revving as he jumps over Winton and runs off. The scene cuts back to Bingo sitting down, with pretend popcorn in her arms.
Bingo: Ready!
Bluey walks towards the centre of the circle. Mackenzie, Coco and Honey watch him on the side.
Bluey: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the circus.
Bluey excitedly shimmies and wags her tail.
Bluey: Our first act today will be...
Bluey deflates as she struggles to figure out what the first act should be. She turns and whispers to the group outside the circle.
Bluey: (whispering) What should our first act be?
Mackenzie excitedly waves his arm.
Mackenzie: I've got an idea.
Bluey: Okay, you say it.
Mackenzie walks over and faces the audience. Bluey walks away.
Mackenzie: Our first act will be a lion jumping through this hoop.
Honey jumps over into the circle. Mackenzie pretends to hold a hoop.
Bingo: Ooh!
Honey wiggles while wagging her tail. Mackenzie picks up a leaf and pretends it's a lion treat.
Mackenzie: Jumpyjump, lion. Come and get your treat.
Bluey leans in.
Bluey: No, you're a mean lion tamer, remember?
Mackenzie: Oh yeah, I forgot.
Mackenzie stomps his foot and adopts a meaner look.
Mackenzie: Jump, lazy lion!
Honey roars at Mackenzie's sudden mean streak. Coco comes cartwheeling in.
Coco: Husband, be kind to your lion.
Mackenzie: I'm not your husband.
Honey roars and jumps away, apparently pretending to catch prey. Bluey does a tada pose and everyone looks at Bingo. Bingo cheers and claps her hands.
Bingo: Yeah!
Honey gets up on two feet and does a begging pose. Mackenzie looks at the pretend treat and decides to just throw the treat away over his shoulder.
Mackenzie: No treat for you.
Honey growls and starts to follow Mackenzie menacingly. Bluey laughs as she tries to hold Honey back. Coco comes cartwheeling again.
Coco: Bluey, Mackenzie doesn't wanna be my husband.
Bluey: Mackenzie, can you pretend to be Coco's husband?
Mackenzie: But, I don't want to!
Bluey: Sorry Coco, he doesn't want to.
Coco: Well, can't you make him"
Bluey: Mm, no.
Bingo: Yeah, if he doesn't want to, Bluey can't make him.
Coco looks down, dejected.
Coco: Okay...
She cartwheels away.
Honey runs off, growling as Bluey yelps a bit from the sudden outburst. A sudden crash and a scream from a border collie pup can be heard from offscreen. It's shown that Honey is on Mackenzie, roaring in his face. Mackenzie tries to shield his face with a groan. Bingo giggles loudly from the chaos. Winton gets up and sees the group playing their circus game. After a quick glance at Hercules to make sure he's distracted, he gets up and runs off towards Bluey. Bluey runs in, panting and wipiing her forehead.
BLuey: Ladies and gentlemen, for our next act, um...
Bluey hesitates as she struggles to come up with something. She looks at the others for answers.
Bluey: What should our next act be?
Winton runs in, coming right up to Bluey.
Winton: Bluey! Can I play with you?
Bluey: Oh, um... Can Winton play circus with us?
MAckenzie, Coco and Honey: Yeah!
Bingo: Yeah!
Bluey: Yeah, you can play.
Winton puts his arms up.
Winton: Whoo!
Bluey: We need a muscle man.
Winton: Can I be a clown instead? I can do this!
Winton pushes his jowls together and makes a raspberry, causing Bingo to laugh out loud.
Bluey: Haha, okay, you're a clown.
Honey: Yeah, Fluffy the clown!
Winton pushes his jowls together and makes another raspberry, causing the whole group to laugh. We cut back to Hercules, who is still playing his motorbike game. After he turns a corner, he finally notices that his jump has gone missing.
Hercules: Where'd my jump go?
Laughter catches Hercules' ears, making him look overat the group playing and laughing. Hercules looks over at them, upset.
Hercules: Hey!
We cut back to Macknezie and Honey, who are in the middle of a trick. Honey has a leaf on her nose, and Mackenzie is pointing at it.
Mackenzie: Wait... wait...
Winton and Coco: Just give her the treat!
Honey's tail is wagging at this point from all the anticipation. Mackenzie keeps pointing at the leaf, looking a bit excited.
Mackenzie: Wait...
Mackenzie suddenly takes the treat and throws it over his shoulder while making a chomping noise. He rubs his belly while smiling contently.
Mackenzie: Mmm!
Bingo gasps in horror at the terrible actions of the lion tamer.
Bluey, Bingo and Coco: Mackenzie!
Honey gets very angry at that horrible trick and decides to run off, roaring and growling. Mackenzie runs off after her.
Everyone: Come back!
Bluey: Coco, keep doing your thing!
Coco starts to do cartwheels as Winton does his funny trick more.
Coco: I told him not to be mean to that lion!
Winton stands in front of Bingo and keeps doing his trick, making her giggle. He looks over at Hercules, who called him from offscreen.
Hercules: Winton! You're supposed to be my jump!
Hercules marches in and stands in the circle.
Winton: Yes, I know... but now I'm Fluffy the Clown!
Hercules does his trick once more, making Bingo giggle and fall over.
Hercules: Well, I wanna play with you too.
Coco: Well, we'll have to ask Bluey. She's the ringmaster.
Hercules walks up to Coco, pushing Winton aside while pointing to himself.
Coco: Uhh, okay. I guess you can. We're playing circus. 
Hercules: No, we're playing motorbikes. You can all be my jumps.
Bingo: You can't tell us what to play. 
Hercules: Yes, I can.
Hercules points to the ground while looking at Winton and Coco.
Hercules: Now lie down, jumps.
Winton, Coco and Bingo lie down in a row as Hercules starts his engines yet again. We pan over to a nearby miniature cricket playset. Mackenzie is waving a lion treat in front of Honey to coax her out as Bluey happily watches.
Mackenzie: Come out here at once, you cheeky lion!
Honey growls and pounces on Mackenzie, who falls right to the ground. Honey roars as Mackenzie struggles to get back up. We cut to the motorbikes game where our jumps appear bored, especially Bingo. Hercules jumps over his jumps again.
Coco: Mmm, this is a bit boring.
Winton: Yeah, let's run away!
Bingo: No.
Bingo gets up and halts Hercules.
Bingo: Stop!
Hercules: Ah!
Winton and Coco sit up to watch Bingo confront Hercules.
Bingo: You can play with us if you like, but you have to play circus.
Hercules: No!
Bingo: Okay, well you can't play with us.
Hercules closes his eyes and crosses his arms.
Hercules: You can't tell me what to do.
Hercules opens his eyes.
Bingo: Yes, I can tell you what to do 'cause we were playing first.
Hercules: Fine, I'll just stand here and do this.
Hercules inhales then does a loud, long raspberry. Winton, Coco and Bingo pull on their ears to try and block out the sound.
Winton: Hercules!
Bingo: Stop it!
Coco: No more!
We cut back to Bluey, Honey and Mackenzie. Honey is still on top of Mackenzie, who is laughing on the floor. Bluey is now trying to pry the lion off of the poor lion tamer. Bluey gets an idea and stops.
Bluey: I'll go get some help!
Bluey runs off to find some help. 
We cut back to Hercules and the others. Hercules is still doing his raspberry, and the others are still trying to block it out.
Bingo: Stop it! That's enough!
Winton: Stop!
Coco: Cut it out!
Bluey runs up to them. arriving just in time.
Bluey: Hey, what's going on here?
Bingo: This meanie isn't doing what I tell him to!
Bluey smiles and takes Hercules' hand. This makes him stop his raspberry and look at BLuey.
Bluey: Oh, don't be so silly.
Hercules: Hmm?
Bluey: Come on. You're just in time. We need a muscle man to help save our lion tamer.
Hercules looks over at Mackenzie struggling with Honey still.
Mackenzie: Do as you're told, you stinky lion!
Hercules looks at them, determined. Bluey starts leading Hercules to them.
Bluey: Come on!
Hercules comes up to them and seperates the two, putting them under his arms. Mackenzie points at Honey.
Mackenzie: You meanie lion!
That mean remark made Honey whimper and look up at Hercules sadlym making Hercules' face soften. Hercules smiles and puts Honey down.
Hercules: You're not a meanie. You're a good little liom.
Hercules pets Honey on the head.
Hercules holds Mackenzie and looks at him angrily.
Hercules: It's you who's the meanie. 
Mackenzie: Me?
We cut back to show that the rest of the group arrived at the scene.
Coco: Yes, you!
Hercules puts Mackenzie up higher and starts spinning him around, causing the border collie to scream. This makes the others laugh.
Mackenzie: It was just pretend!
Winton, Bluey, Coco and Honey laugh at Mackenzie as Bingo collects more popcorn. Bingo sits back down to enjoy the show.
Bluey: Ladies and gentlemen, Hercules the muscle man!
Bingo claps her hands.
Bingo: Hooray!
Bluey: Let's play motorbikes!
Everyone: Yeah!
Hercules puts Mackenzie down and joins everyone else except Mackenzie and Coco in pretending to be motorbikes. Mackenzie is stil stumbling around dizzily as Coco watches the others run off. Coco runs to put her hands on Mackenzie's arms to keep him steady.
Coco: Why don't we be the jumps?
Mackenzie: Good idea.
Coco and Mackenzie lay down to let the other use them as jumps. We fade to later, the Heeler family are leaving the park. Bluey and Bingo have sausages with tomato sauce on top. Bluey also has some of the sauce on her hands.
Chilli: Good snacks, kids?
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah.
Bandit: Bingo, you mind picking up your rubbish, mate?
Bingo: Yes, dad.
Bandit: Cheers, mate.
Bluey: Oh, I got sauce on my fingers.
Chilli: Oh, that's no good.
Bluey: Can I wipe it on my fur?
Chilli: (voice over): Yeah, go on. It's a free country.
We see three advocates talking about something as the Heeler family leave the park. The credits roll. Instead of Bluey dancing, we see Winton come in and do his trick.
