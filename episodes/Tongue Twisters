Bluey: "Betty Butter had some butter, but the butter was bitter. Betty Butter... butted the butter."
Bingo laughs.
Bluey: "And said 'Bitter butter. Butt. Butt.'"
Bingo laughs.
Bluey: "Okay. Betty Botter had some butter, but, she said, 'This butter's bitter. If I bake this bitter butter, it would make my batter bitter.'"
Bingo laughs.
Bluey: "'But a bit of better butter, but that would make my batter better.' So she bought a bit of butter, better than her bitter butter, and she baked it in her batter. The batter was not bitter, so 'twas better Betty Botter, bought a bit of better butter. I did it!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Hooray!"
