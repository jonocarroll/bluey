Script
We open on a short, white Maltese around Bingo's age named Lila. She stands against a purple and pink polka-dot background.
Lila: My name is Lila, and this is my story. 
Shot changes to Lila on her first day of kindy. She hides behind her mum's leg.
Lila: This is me on my first day at kindy. I was really shy.
Inside, Lila hides herself behind a cover she builds with blocks as the other kids play about.
Lila: Mum says, that's OK, but that meant sometimes I wasn't really good at making friends.
She peeks out of the cover.
Lila: I just didn't know how to do it.
Return to the purple background.
Lila: But then one day that all changed.
The Heeler household, sunrise.
Lila: And it started with pet feet.
Inside, Bandit is sleeping. Enter Bluey and Bingo, who pull up the covers to reveal his feet.
Bluey Heeler: Oh, hello, my lovely little pet foot.
Bingo Heeler: Oh, hello, my lovely little pet foot.
Bluey: (sniffing) Oh, you're extra stinky this morning.
Bingo: (also sniffing) Pooh, yeah.
Bluey: Time for tricks. Ready? Stand.
Bandit's foot stands up. Both girls giggle.
Bluey: Good boy. Up.
Bandit's foot raises upward, eliciting another giggle.
Bluey: Let's say hello to lefty!
Suddenly, Bandit's feet start to attack each other!
Bingo: Your pet's attacking my pet!
Bluey: Sit, Righty, sit!
The girls giggle once again.
Bingo: Come here! Yaaa!
She launches herself at the foot, clinging on to it; Bluey giggles once again.
Bandit Heeler: Oh, the kids - argh! - are awake.
Chilli Heeler: You like making extra work for yourself, don't you?
Bandit: Yeah. At least I get to lie in bed, though.
Chilli: You know it's Daddy Dropoff this morning.
This startles Bandit awake. Gotta be done!
Bandit: Right! Kids! Daddy Dropoff! We are not gonna be late this time. 
Bandit sees that Bluey and Bingo have attached leashes to his ankles.
Bandit: Huh? Hey!
Bluey and Bingo: (giggles) Walkies!
