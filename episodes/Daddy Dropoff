Lila: My name is Lila and this is my story (View outside of kindy)
This is me on my first day at kindy. I was really shy. Mum says, that's OK, but that meant sometimes I wasn't really good at making friends. I just didn't know how to do it. But then one day that all changed. (The Heeler house) And it started with pet feet.
Bluey: Oh, hello, my lovely little pet foot.
Bingo: Oh, hello, my lovely little pet foot.
Bluey: Oh, you're extra stinky this morning.
Bingo: Pooh, yeah.
Bluey: Time for tricks. Ready? Stand.
(Both GIggle)
Good boy. Up.
(Both Giggle)
Bluey: Let's say hello to lefty. (squeals)
Bingo: You're pet's attacking my pet!
Bluey: Sit, Righty, sit!
Bingo: Come here! Yaaa!
(Bluey Giggles)
Bandit: Oh, the kids - argh! - are awake.
Chilli: You like making extra work for yourself, don't you?
Bandit: Yeah. At least I get to lie in bed, though.
Chilli: You know it's Daddy Dropoff this morning.
This startles Bandit awake.
Bandit: Right! Kids! Daddy Dropoff! We are not gonna be late this time. (Bandit sees that Bluey and Bingo attached leashes to his ankles.) Huh? Hey.
Bluey and Bingo: (Giggles) Walkies!
