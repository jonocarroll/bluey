The episode opens in the living room. Bluey is laying on the rug, drawing with crayons. Chilli sits on the couch, reading a magazine. Bandit walks in from the kitchen. He clutches his belly.
Bandit: "Oh, man, I'm starving! I need to eat something."
Bluey giggles. Chilli rolls her eyes.
Chilli: "Oh, no, Bandit..."
Bandit: "What? Am I not allowed to eat food if I'm hungry? What kind of a regime is this?"
Chilli sighs.
Chilli: "Carry on."
Bandit: "I could go some chicken bucket. Oh, I don't wanna get in the car, though. Too much traffic. That'll take ages! I'm hungry NOW!"
Bandit glances at Bluey.
Bandit: "I'm just gonna eat one of the kids."
Bluey shrieks and takes off running. Bandit lunges after her and tackles her to the ground after only a few steps. Bluey laughs and Bandit picks her up upside-down. They both pause as Chilli interjects.
Chilli: "You know that kids don't agree with you."
Bandit: "Ah, she'll be right. I'll have a peppermint tea after."
Bandit pantomimes shaking salt on Bluey.
Bandit: "Put a bit of salt on first..."
Bandit pretends to eat Bluey.
Bandit: "Chew, chew, chew. Swallow!"
He holds Bluey against his stomach, still upside-down.
Bandit: "Oh, man, that was good. Kids really fill you up."
Bandit turns around and glares at Chilli.
Bandit: "Was that so bad, Mum?"
Chilli: "I'm just saying, the last time you ate a kid, you were up all night."
Bandit: "It's all good."
Bandit starts to walk, haltingly, over to the couch.
Bandit: "Oh, hang on. Ugh... Oh, man."
Bandit: (queasily) "Something's not sitting right."
Bingo runs in, laughing.
Chilli: "See?"
Bingo: "Hi!"
Bandit: "Oh, Bingo, I'm not feeling so good. It might have been something I ate."
Chilli: "Might have been?"
Bandit: "Oh, man... Gut's a crook."
Bandit starts to lift Bluey up, pretending to vomit. Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: (retching) "Rugh... rugh... BLAAAAUGH!"
Bandit "vomits" up Bluey, dumping her on Bingo. Chilli pulls her feet up, out of the splatter zone. Bluey and Bingo squeal and laugh. Bandit coughs.
Bandit: (queasily) "Oh, sorry, Bingo. I didn't mean to chunder on you."
Bingo: (laughing) "That's okay."
Bandit: (retching) "Ugh. Ough."
Chilli: "Are you finished?"
Bandit wipes his mouth.
Bandit: (brightly) "Yep!"
Chilli: "Good. I hope you've learned your lesson."
Bandit puts a hand on his stomach and looks around.
Bandit: "Oh, man. Still a bit hungry."
Bandit leans over and sniffs Bluey.
Bandit: "Hm. Smells okay."
Bandit shrugs. He looks around, sneakily. Then he grabs Bluey and pretends to eat her again. Chilli winces
Chilli: "Ugh, Bandit, no!"
Bandit: "Omf, omf!"
Bluey and Bingo squeal and laugh.
