Bandit: Oh-ho! That was a big one.
Chilli: Charming.
Bluey and Bingo run into the room.
Bluey: Mum, can you and Dad smoochy kiss?
Bandit: Yup.
Bandit turns his head to kiss Chilli, but before he could do that, she blocked him with a book she was reading.
Chilli: Not so fast! Why do you want us to smoochy kiss?
Bingo: Because we like it.
Bluey: Yeah, it's very romance.
Chilli: Where did you learn that word?
Bluey: TV.
Bingo: We know all about romance.
Chilli: Well, maybe you could teach your dad about that.
Nail flies off.
Bandit: Outrageous!
Bluey: Yeah, let's teach Dad!
Bingo: We can set up the restaurant.
Bluey: The Fancy Restaurant!
Bingo: Yeah!
This episode of Bluey is called Fancy Restaurant.
Bandit and Chilli walk in the imaginary Fancy Restaurant.
Bandit: I'll show you a thing or two about romance.
Chilli: Ooh, can't wait.
Bluey: Hello. Welcome to the Fancy Restaurant. Are you husband and wife?
Bandit grabs Chilli by the hand.
Bandit: Yes, we are.
Chilli lets go of Bandit's hand.
Chilli: No, we aren't.
Bandit: Huh?
Chilli: This is our first date. We met five minutes ago.
Bluey: Very good. Do you have a booking?
Bandit: Ah, yes. The name's Romeo McFlourish.
Bluey: Hmm, Romeo.
She slides her finger down the booking list.
Bluey: Nope, never heard of you.
Bandit: Oh. Well, can we have a table anyway?
Bluey: You'll have to make a booking.
Bandit: Well, I'd like to make a booking, please.
Bluey: No, you have to call.
Bandit: Ugh. OK. Boop. Ring-ring.
Bluey: Hello?
Bandit: Hi. I'd like to make a booking, please.
Bluey: Name?
Bandit: Romeo... Oh, uh, what was it?
Chilli: McFlourish.
Bandit: McFlourish. Of course.
Bluey: OK, great. See you soon. Bee-boop. Hi, do you have a booking?
Bandit: Yes, McFlourish.
Bluey: Oh, yes. Right this way, please.
Bandit: Finally.
Chilli: Smooth, Romeo.
Bandit and Chilli are sitting at a table.
Bandit: I have, of course, taken you to the fanciest restaurant in town.
Bingo enters holding a pan with a can of beans on it.
Bingo: Baked beans!
She slams the pan on the table which scares both Bandit & Chilli.
Chilli: Oh, dear.
Bluey: Not yet, Chef Bingo.
Bingo takes the frying pan and starts to leave the room with Bluey following her.
Bingo: Have they smoochy kissed yet?
Bluey: No, not yet.
Bluey turns around and walks back to the table.
Bluey: I'm so sorry. She's new. Now, these are the menus. You also have some forks and spoons.
Bluey hands the menus to Bandit & Chilli.
Bandit: Told you this place was fancy.
Bluey: Now, what would you like to order?
Chilli: Could you tell me what the special is?
Bluey: Mm, I'm not sure. I'll check with the chef.
She turns around.
Bluey: HEY, CHEF!
Bingo: What?
Bluey: What's the special?
Bingo: The WHAT?
Bluey: THE SPECIAL!
Bingo: The WHAT?
Bluey makes a disappointed face and then turns around to Bandit & Chilli.
Bluey: There's no special.
Chilli: I'll just have the baked beans, then.
Bandit & Chilli hand the menus back to Bluey.
Bluey: Very good. I'll be right back. Please enjoy your cutlery.
Bluey walks away.
Bandit: Ah, excuse me. I'll be right back.
Bandit runs to the imaginary kitchen.
Bandit: Hey, dodgy brothers. Haven't you got anything other than baked beans?
Bingo: What's wrong with baked beans?
Bandit: Well, they're not very romance.
Bingo: Hmm. Yeah, I guess we could make something else.
Bluey: Something special?
Bingo: Yeah, something special!
Bluey: Ooh, and I'll play some romance music.
Bingo giggles.
Bluey: Leave it to us. Now go and do a smoochy kiss.
Bluey starts pushing Bandit back to the table.
Bandit: Hey!
Bandit: Oh. I'm back.
Bandit sits down.
Chilli: So, has the romance started yet?
Bandit: Very soon, my darling... Uh, what's your name again?
Chilli: Oh! Super smooth. 
Bluey starts playing annoying music on a keytar.
Bluey: Ooh, what's this? Some romance music.
Chilli: Oh. It's...lovely!
Bandit: So, ah...
Bluey: Hey!
Bandit: Tell me more about...
Bluey: Let go!
Bandit: ..your stuff.
Bandit falls off the chair and Bluey stops playing on the keytar.
Chilli: If you'll excuse me.
Bandit: What? You're leaving me?
Chilli: I'm just going to the bathroom.
Bluey: Oh, yes, it's just in that corner next to the bookshelf.
Chilli: Oh. Fancy.
Chilli walks away.
Bluey: Why haven't you smoochy kissed her yet?
Bandit: Well, how can I when you're making all that racket?
Bluey: You need to be more romance.
Bandit: I'm trying! I think I've just forgotten my moves. I guess it has been a while.
Bluey: Well, toughen up, Romeo. We wanna see a smoochy kiss.
The scene changes to the interior of a fridge.
Bingo: Ooh. This looks special. 
The scene changes back to the table.
Chilli: I'm back. 
Bluey: Very good, madam.
Bandit: Ah, so, did you have a nice time in the toilet?
Chilli: Excuse me?
Bluey facepalms.
Bingo: Bluey, I need you!
Bluey: Just a moment.
She points her finger at Bandit:
Bluey: Be. Romance.
Bluey runs to the imaginary kitchen. She looks at the jelly with spaghetti and beans on it.
Bluey: Wow. So beautiful.
Bingo: I made a special.
Bluey: You used real food.
Bingo: Is that special?
Bluey: Yeah, that's really special.
Back at the table.
Chilli: There's no romance coming, is there?
Bandit: Ugh. No. I'm sorry. I may have forgotten how to be romance.
Chilli: Well, I have too. It's not easy when you're tired all the time.
Bandit: Yeah, and when you get interrupted every five...
Bluey: Dinner!
Bluey places a can of beans on the table.
Bluey: Here's your baked beans. And here's your special dinner!
Bluey removes the cloth from the jelly made by Bingo.
Chilli: Wow. That is...special.
Bluey: Our chef made this especially for you.
Chilli: Oh, you shouldn't have.
Bluey: Here you go, madam.
Chilli: Thank you. Mm, so good.
Bluey: You can't just eat it pretend.
Bingo: Yeah, you have to eat it for real life.
Chilli: Oh. Um, the thing is...
Bingo: You don't like it?
Chilli: Um, well I do, but...
Bingo: You don't think it's special.
Bluey embraces Bingo while giving Chilli an angry look.
Chilli: Um, uh... It's just... Um...
Bandit: Hang on. I know this isn't very romantic, but can we swap? Yours looks delicious.
Both smile at each other.
Chilli: Oh, OK. I guess we could.
Chilli gives the spoon with the jelly to Bandit. He looks at it for a second.
Bandit: To romance.
He eats the jelly while making a disgusted face.
Bandit: Ohh. Ugh, it's great.
Bluey: You have to finish it.
Bandit: Oh. OK. Bleh! Oh, so good. Oh, man. I can't get enough of this.
The scene changes to the night sky with owls hooting in the background. The scene then changes back the the table with the empty plate.
Bandit puts the spoon on the plate. He then proceeds to cough.
Bluey: Would you like dessert?
Chilli: Ah, no! I mean, uh, this was such a special evening. I feel like taking a moonlit stroll with my new love.
Bingo: They're holding hands.
Bluey: Oh, yes. The moon is that way.
Chilli: This way, my special man. 
Bluey: Well, they didn't smoochy kiss, but she is rubbing his back.
Bingo: Yeah, that's still romance.
Bluey: Yeah.
Bluey and Bingo walk back into the house. The episode ends with Bandit vomiting being cut off.
