The episode opens with a shot of a red helicopter flying far overhead. Cut to the car interior - Bluey watches it through the car window. After a moment, the camera pulls back, showing Bingo in the other car seat, and Chilli driving.
Bluey: "Is it Monday today?"
Chilli: "Yep! And you know what Monday means."
Bluey: "Yeah! Playdate with Honey after school!"
Bingo: "And Dad takes me to gymnastics!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Hooray!"
Chilli honks the horn as she cheers.
Chilli: "Whoo-whoo!"
The phone rings.
Chilli: "Oh, Dad's calling."
The phone chimes, accepting the call in hands-free mode. The kids lean forward in their car seats to hear better.
Chilli: "Hello?"
Bandit: (on speaker phone) "Hey, Babe."
Bluey, Bingo: "Hi, Dad!"
Bandit: (on speaker phone) "Ah, hey kids."
Chilli: "What's up?"
Bandit: (on speaker phone) "I can't take Bingo to gymnastics. I have to fly to Longreach."
Bingo slumps in her car seat.
Bingo: "Ohh!"
Bandit: (on speaker phone) "Sorry, Bingo."
Chilli: "No worries. I'll take you to gymnastics, Bingo... it just means I'll have to miss watercolour."
Bingo: "Hooray!"
Chilli: "And, Bluey, you'll have to come with us."
Bluey: "So I can't go to Honey's?"
Chilli: "No, sorry, sweetie."
Bluey slumps in her car seat.
Bluey: "Oh, not hooray."
The car is awkwardly silent for a few seconds.
Bandit: "Well... um... have fun!"
Chilli rolls her eyes.
Chilli: (sarcastically) "Oh, thanks!"
The Heelers arrive at Glasshouse primary school. The class is out in the yard - the Terriers are doing armpit farts, Winton sits on the porch splashing his feet in the water feature. Snickers talks to Calypso, Honey and Chloe are playing patty-cake, and Rusty and Jack are playing Army.
Chilli and Bingo walk Bluey up the front path. Bluey stops on the front porch and turns to Chilli.
Bluey: "I really wanted to go to Honey's."
Chilli kneels down and puts a hand on Bluey's shoulder.
Chilli: "I hear you, but that's life, sweetie. Things pop up that you can't control."
She kisses Bluey on the forehead and stands up.
Chilli: "You just have to go with it."
Chilli turns and leaves.
Bingo: (goofily) "Goodbyeee!"
Bingo follows after Chilli.
Bluey: (sadly) "Oh..."
Cut to the stump of a two-trunked tree. The lower half of th stump has a green sprout of new growth with a pair of leaves. Bluey walks up to it, sadly. She climbs up on the lower stump and sits down. She grabs the sprout like it's a control stick, pulls back, and makes a helicopter noise with her mouth.
Bluey: "Choop-choop-choop-choop-choop!"
TITLE CARD - Helicopter
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Helicopter."
Cut back to Bluey, pretending to fly a helicopter. The camera has been raised slightly, so the ground is no longer visible.
Bluey: "Choop-choop-choop-choop-choop!"
Winton: (off screen) "Hey! Bluey!"
Bluey: "Hey, Winton!"
Bluey waves to Winton below her. She pushes the control stick down and pretends to land.
Bluey: "Choop-choop-choop-choop-choop. Land."
Winton walks into frame from screen right.
Bluey: "This is a helicopter."
Winton climbs onto the stump.
Winton: "Oh, okay. Can I fly it?"
He reaches for the control stick, and Bluey holds it away from him.
Bluey: "No, I'm the pilot."
Winton sits back down.
Winton: "Oh, okay. Can you take me to my Dad's house?"
Bluey: "Um, no. I say where we go and what we do. But you can be the passenger."
Winton: "Okay."
Bluey: "Ready for takeoff?"
They both lean back as she pulls on the control stick and pretends to take off.
Bluey: "Choop-choop-choop-choop-choop!"
Bluey levels off. Winton, intially excited, rapidly loses interest.
Bluey: "Choop. Choop. Choop. Choop. Choop. Choop. Choop. Choop. Choop. Choop. Choop."
Winton: "I'm a bit bored. I might go now."
Winton hops off the side of the stump. Bluey lunges and grabs his hand, suspending him off the side of the "helicopter."
Bluey: "Ah! Winton! You can't just get out of a helicopter in the middle of the sky!"
Winton: "Oh, sorry, I forgot!"
Bluey: "Ah! You're slipping!"
Winton: "Arghhh!"
Bluey: "What are we gonna do?"
Winton: "Fly over my Dad's house! He has a pool!"
Bluey: "Oh, yeah, I can drop you in it. Where does he live?"
Winton: "I dunno!"
Bluey: "Winton!"
Winton: "I know he doesn't live with my mum!"
Bluey: "Well, I'll just look for his pool."
Winton: "It's the one with the shallow end and a deep end. We do backstroke in the deep end."
Bluey: "There it is! I'll drop you on three. One, two..."
Winton: "Make sure you aim for the deep end!"
Bluey: "Okay. Three!"
She drops Winton, who falls out of frame.
Winton: "Arghhhh!"
His scream fades with distance. He makes a splashing noise.
Winton: "Pshhh! Hi, Dad."
Bluey: "Hee-hee! That was fun. Choop-choop-choop-choop-choop!"
Bluey: "Hey, Chloe!"
Chloe: (off screen) "Hi, Bluey!"
She pretends to land the helicopter.
Bluey: "Choopchoop! Land."
Chloe enters from screen right.
Bluey: "This is a helicopter, get in!"
Chloe climbs up on the stump.
Chloe: "Okay. Can I fly it?"
Bluey: "No, you're the passenger. But you can tell me where you want me to take you."
Chloe: "Oh, can you take me to see the Great Barrier Reef?"
Bluey: "Um, sure. That's fine."
Bluey pretends to take off.
Bluey: "Choop-choop-choop-choop-choop!"
Bluey: "There it is, the Great Barrier Reef."
Chloe: "Ooh, I'll take some photos."
She pretends to take photos with a camera phone.
Chloe: "Chickee-chickee! Look at that big whale!"
She leans over Bluey to get a better angle.
Chloe: "Chickee-chickee!"
She pretends to drop her phone out the window.
Chloe: "Arghh! I dropped my phone and it landed in the whale's spout thing."
Bluey: "Oh, I'll get that back for you."
She pretends to lean out the side of the helicopter, but she can't reach it.
Bluey: "Urghh! Uh, can you fly the helicopter for a second?"
Chloe: "Sure."
Chloe takes the control stick.
Bluey: "But just for a second. I'm still the pilot, okay?"
Chloe: "Okay."
Bluey: "Yarrh!"
Bluey leaps out of the side of the helicopter, out of frame. Chloe scooches over, taking over the pilot's seat.
Bluey: (off screen) "Give me that phone, whale!"
Chloe: "Look out! She's about to blow her whale spout thing!"
Bluey leaps back onto the stump.
Bluey, Chloe: "Aaah!"
Chloe: "Hee-hee!"
Chloe gives up the controls and scooches back to the passenger seat.
Bluey: "One phone."
Bluey pretends to hand Chloe's phone back as she takes her seat. Chloe holds it at arms length and they smile for a selfie.
Chloe: "Chickee."
Bluey pretends to land the helicopter.
Bluey: "Choop-choop-choop-choop. Land."
Chloe hops down from the stump.
Chloe: "Bye."
Bluey: "Hee-hee! That was fun. Who's next?"
Cut a shot of the Glasshouse mountains.
Mackenzie: (off screen) "Ruff ruff ruff ruff!"
Cut to the stump. Mackenzie is on all fours on the passenger seat, barking out the side of the helicopter. Bluey looks a bit confused, but continues to "choop" softly.
Mackenzie: "Ruff ruff ruff!"
He folds his arms to his chest and imitates a sheep.
Mackenzie: "Baa! Baa!"
He goes back to all fours, and makes a circling gesture with his left hand.
Mackenzie: "Swing around, swing around!"
Bluey pulls the control stick in circles.
Bluey: "I'm swingin' it 'round!"
Mackenzie: "Ruff ruff ruff! Baa!"
Bluey: "Hee-hee, this is fun!"
Cut to a shot of the sky. A pair of white albatross fly overhead.
Cut back to the stump. Now Snickers is in the passenger seat, pretending to hold a microphone in one hand and pressing on an earpiece with the other.
Snickers: "Welcome to Channel K9 News. This is the helicopter traffic report, and we're brought to you by Hammerbarn."
Snickers points to the ground.
Snickers: "There's a big accident down there!"
Bluey: "Ooh!"
Snickers: "I would avoid that area. And remember to get down to Hammerbarn for cheap shovels."
Bluey waves to the imaginary camera.
Bluey: "Hi!"
Cut to another shot of the sky. A trio of grey albatross fly overhead.
Honey: (off screen) "C-c-cold!"
Cut back to the stump. Honey is shivering and hugging herself for warmth.
Bluey: "Choop-choop! Land."
Honey's glasses slide down her nose. She quickly pushes them back up and goes back to shivering.
Bluey: "There you go. You're all rescued from the sea."
Honey stops shivering.
Honey: "Thank you. I'll stay between the flags next time."
She hops down and walks away. Bluey waves to her.
Bluey:"Bye!"
Rusty runs up and tosses Jack's limp body onto the stump, then jumps on himself.
Jack: "Oof!"
Bluey: "Agh!"
Rusty: "Get us out of here! Go, go, go!"
Bluey: "Ooh, okay."
Bluey pretends to take off.
Bluey: "Choop-choop-choop-choop."
Jack: "Arghh!"
Jack clutches his knee.
Rusty: "Where does it hurt, soldier?"
Jack: "Ah, it's my leg, Sarge."
Bluey: "Is everything all right back there?"
Rusty points in front of them.
Rusty: "Arghh! Rocket!"
Bluey: "Aah! what do I do?"
Rusty: "Dodge it!"
Bluey: "Aah!"
Bluey pushes the control stick to screen left, leaning her whole body into it. Jack swings his hand, pantomiming a rocket flying past, then exploding behind them.
Rusty: "Fwshhhh! Bkewww!"
Bluey: "I dodged it!"
Rusty points to screen left.
Rusty: "Boom! We're hit!"
Bluey: "No, we're not, I dodged it!"
Rusty: (panicking) "We're going down!"
Bluey: (annoyed) "We're not going down, we're goin' up!"
Rusty: "Please, can we go down, Bluey?"
Bluey: "It's my helicopter and I don't want it going down."
Rusty: "It's just part of our game to go down."
Jack: "It's more fun."
Bluey: "Well, um... Okay. We can go down."
Rusty: "Thanks, Bluey!"
Rusty: (panicking) "We're going down!"
Bluey: "Hold on!"
Bluey, Rusty, Jack: "Arghhh!"
Bluey and Rusty lean back slightly, as the camera shakes and tilts, giving the impression of a crashing aircraft.
Rusty: "Boom!"
Rusty throws himself prone and Jack bounces off the stump for a moment, as the camera bounces and then returns to normal.
Bluey: "Ooh! Everyone okay?"
Rusty gives a thumbs up, and then retrieves his hat.
Rusty: "Yep. You stay and fix the chopper, pilot.
Rusty hops down.
Rusty: "We'll go on foot."
He picks Jack up by his backpack straps and slings him over his shoulder in a fireman's carry.
Rusty: "Hup!"
Jack: "Oof."
Rusty salutes Bluey.
Rusty: "Good luck!"
Bluey waves as Rusty and Jack leave.
Bluey: "Thanks!"
Bluey makes a hammering motion with one hand.
Bluey: "Fix, fix, fix."
Indy walks up.
Bluey: "Hi, Indy."
Indy: "Hi, Bluey. Can you rescue these kangaroos from the bushfire?"
She gestures behind her, and the shot pulls back to show the Terriers playing Kangaroo.
The Terriers: "Boing-boing-boing-boing!"
Bluey: "This helicopter's too small for all those kangies."
Indy: "Oh, yeah. Um, can we pretend it's a plane? Planes are bigger."
Bluey: "Oh, it's just... I was playing helicopter."
Indy: "Oh, okay. Um..."
She turns to the Terriers.
Indy: "Sorry, kangies, there's no room."
Charcoal Terrier: "Hmm."
The Terriers: (sadly) "Boing."
Bluey looks away for a moment, and then comes to a decision.
Bluey: "Actually, it's fine. It can be a plane."
Indy, The Terriers: "Hooray!"
Cut to the stump, with Indy and the Terriers as passengers.
Bluey: "Get ready to take off!"
Bluey pulls up on the control stick and makes a whooshing noise with her mouth.
Bluey: "Hwooosh!"
Indy: "Hooray! We escaped the bushfire!"
Bluey lowers the control stick.
Bluey: "...Land. There you go. You can live here."
The Terriers jump down and start hopping around.
The Terriers: "Boing-boing-boing-boing!"
Indy: "Where should we go now, Bluey?"
The Terriers: (off screen) "Boing-boing-boing-boing!"
Bluey: "Actually, I think I want to be a kangaroo now."
The camera pulls back, showing the Terriers bouncing around next to the stump.
Bluey: "Looks fun." 
The Terriers: "Boing-boing-boing-boing!"
Indy: "Ooh, can I have your plane?"
Bluey: "Um, sure, that's fine."
Indy: "Thank you!"
Bluey passes the control stick to Indy and climbs down.
Bluey: "Bye."
She pats the stump gently.
Bluey: "Thank you, helicopter plane."
Bluey starts bouncing.
Bluey: "Boing-boing-boing-boing!"
She joins the Terriers, bouncing in circles.
Bluey, the Terriers: "Boing-boing-boing-boing!"
Indy pulls up on the control stick.
Indy: "Vnnnn!"
Cut to the front porch of the school. Chilli climbs the steps, as Rusty and Jack jump down then, laughing. Chilli crouches down.
Chilli: "Hey, sweetheart!"
Bluey runs up, and they hug.
Chilli: "Ooh! How was your day?"
Bluey: "Good. Are we going to Honey's now?"
Chili takes Bluey's hand in hers.
Chilli: "Oh, no, sorry, sweetie. We have to take Bingo to gymnastics, remember?"
Bluey: "Oh, yeah, that's right."
Chilli stands up.
Chilli: "Is that okay?"
They walk down the steps, still holding hands.
Bluey: "Um, sure. That's fine.
The episode theme, an airy number with brass and woodwinds, plays over the end credits. Bluey dances as the credits roll.
