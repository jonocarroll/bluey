Bluey: Let's see how far we can throw it.
Bingo: Okay.
Bingo throws the stick almost straight down, into the pool at her feet. Bluey tries a sidearm throw, but releases too late and throws it straight up to land behind her.
Bluey: Whoo!
Bingo: Mmm. Not very far.
The shot pulls back to show Chilli and Bandit sitting under the umbrella behind Bluey and Bingo. Bandit is still staring into space. Chilli is sitting on a beach chair, reading a book.
Chilli: (amused) Who taught you kids how to throw?
Bluey: No-one.
Chilli: (to Bandit) You want to handle this?
Bandit does not react. Chilli snaps her fingers by his head.
Chilli: Hey. Heeler.
Bandit: Oh, sorry. What?
Chilli: Nothing. Come on, kids. I'll teach you how to throw.
The scene cuts to a close up of Chilli balancing a rock on a forked stick, which has been stuck upright in the pool.
The scene changes to show Chilli walking out of the pool, as Bluey and Bingo wait with sticks at the edge.
Chilli: Alright. This is the target. Now, stand side-on like you're on a skateboard.
She demonstrates. Bluey copies her. Bingo faces the wrong way.
Chilli: Other way, Bingo.
Bingo: Oh.
She faces the correct direction.
Chilli: Bend your knees. Get comfy.
She bends her knees and shimmies; Bluey and Bingo copy her. She points with the index finger of her free arm.
Chilli: Aim with this finger. Lean on your back foot.
Chilli leans back to throw. The kids copy her.
Chilli: Then you're gonna swoop.
She throws the stick as she says "swoop". It lands next to the target.
Chilli: Use your whole body. Not just your arm.
Bluey and Bingo throw their sticks, making it about halfway to the target.
Chilli: Yeah, that's better. Let's go again.
They wade into the pool to retrieve their sticks.
Bingo: Why do we have to learn to throw properly?
Chilli: So you can throw things really far.
Bluey: Do we need to throw things really far?
Chilli shrugs.
Chilli: Sometimes.
Bingo: I need better sticks.
Chilli: Ooh, I bet there's some over there.
Bingo: Can I go look?
Chilli: Yeah, you go.
Bingo squeals and runs off.
Chilli: Let's try again.
The scene cuts back to Bandit. He's still under the umbrella, staring into space. Bingo runs up.
Bingo: Dad, race me to that stick.
Bandit does not respond.
Bingo: Dad. Dad!
She pats his side.
Bandit: Sorry, mate. What was that?
The shot pulls back to show Chilli and Bluey as well.
Chilli: Let it go, babe. You're missing all this.
Chilli gestures to Bluey throwing a stick.
Bandit: I'm trying.
Bingo: What are you trying?
Bandit: Nothing. You want a race, do you?
Bingo: Yeah. Ready, set, go!
Bandit: Hey, what?!
Bingo runs off giggling. Bandit breaks out of the mermaid tail and brushes off his legs.
Bandit: (grunts) I'm coming!
The scene cuts to an aerial shot of Bandit chasing Bingo along the edge of the water.
Bandit: I'm gonna catch you!

Bingo: I win!
Bandit: (panting) Ah, Bingo, you're too quick for me.
Bingo: Oh, Dad, look.
Bingo picks up the stick.
Bingo: It looks like a bird's head.
Bandit: Oh, yeah, it does too.
Bingo: Can we make a stickbird?
Bandit: Yeah, righto.
Bingo: Hooray!
The scene cuts to a montage with no dialogue. It cuts back and forth between Bandit and Bingo building the stickbird, and Chilli teaching Bluey to throw.

Bingo: Dad. Dad?
Bandit: Uh... yep.
He turns around.
Bingo: We'll have to find another stick.
Bandit walks back over to Bingo and the stickbird.
Bandit: Oh, why?
Bingo: Because we can't throw stickbird's head.
Bandit: Oh, yeah, of course not. We'd never do that to you, stickbird.
Bandit pats stickbird's back. Bingo pets its beak.
Bingo: You're too beautiful.
Bandit: Come on, let's try over there. Ready, set, go!

Bingo: Bye, stickbird!

Bandit: Well, they probably just wanted the stick.
Bandit and Bingo turn around, to look at the kids running around on the far side of the stream.
Bandit: They wouldn't have known we just made it.
The camera cuts back to just Bandit and Bingo. Bingo folds her arms and scowls.

Bluey: Hey, Dad, I can throw!
Bandit: Aww, nice one, Bluey.
Bluey: Come and see. Bingo, I'll race you back.
Bandit: Uh, Bingo's a bit upset at the moment.

Bingo: Hmm.
Bluey: There's usually some in your belly... or your neck.

Bingo: And always remember to check your ears.
Bluey and Bingo bounce up and down with their heads cocked, as though they're trying to shake something out of their ears, with their hands held out to catch it. They giggle.
Bluey: Now you've got all that upset and angry in your hands.
Bingo: What do I do with it?
Bluey: Do you want to keep it?
Bingo: No, I don't want it.
Bluey: Well, what do you do with something you don't want anymore?

Bingo: (laughs)

Bluey turns her to face the ocean.
Bluey: You throw it away.
Bingo: Oh...
Bingo cocks her arm to throw.
Bluey: Uh-uh, like Mum said, you need to throw this thing really far.
Bingo takes the throwing pose Chilli taught her, step-by-step.
Bingo: Stand sideways, like on a skateboard.
Bluey: Bend your knees.
Bingo: Yeah. Get comfy.
Bluey: That's good.
Bluey: Aim with this arm...
She points.
Bingo: And... Yee-ah!
Bingo pantomimes throwing something.
Bandit and Bluey: Whoa!
Bandit shades his eyes.
