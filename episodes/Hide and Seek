The episode opens in the corner of the back yard. Bandit lays on the grass, eyes closed. Bluey lays against his stomach, looking pensive. To their right, in the flower bed, is a meditating garden gnome.
Bluey: "Mum?"
Bandit: "I'm not your Mum."
Bluey: "I mean, Dad?"
Bandit: "Yeees?"
Bluey: "Can we please play Hide and Seek now?"
Bandit: "In a bit."
Bluey folds her arms.
Bluey: "Hmph!"
Bluey looks at the garden gnome. The scene briefly cuts to a close-up of the gnome.
Bluey: "Why is the statue dog just sitting there?"
Bandit: "He's practicing not getting distracted."
Bluey: "What? You don't needto practice for that."
Bandit: "Are you sure?
Bluey: "Yes."
Bluey: "Not getting distracted is easy. Watch."
Bluey crosses her legs and folds her hands in her lap, in imitation of the gnome. She closes her eyes.
A crimson dragonfly flits past. Bluey immediately opens her eyes to look at it.
Bluey: "Ooh! A dragonfly!"
The dragonfly flies off. Bluey climbs over Bandit, chasing after it.
Bandit: "Oof!"
Bluey giggles as she runs off. Bandit closes his eyes and shakes his head.
Cut to the base of the poinciana tree. Bluey enters, chasing the dragonfly and laughing. Bingo walks in from the other direction, holding a carrot with a bite out of it. She holds the carrot to her forehead.
Bingo: (deep voice) "Carrot horn!"
Bluey: "Hey, Bingo, let's play Hide and Seek!"
Bingo: "Yeah, Hide and Seek!"
TITLE CARD - Hide and Seek
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Hide and Seek."
Bandit, Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo are standing in the play room, at the entrance to the verandah.
Bluey: "Okay, you all hide, and I'll seek. Go!"
Bluey covers her eyes and begins to count. Nobody moves.
Bluey: "One! Two—"
Chilli: "Hang on."
Bandit: "Yeah, hang on a minute."
Bingo: "Hang on."
Chilli: "We'll only hide if you promise not to forget you're looking for us."
Bluey waves dismissively.
Bluey: "I've never done that!"
Bandit, Chilli, Bingo: " Yes, you have!"
Bluey giggles.
Bluey: "Okay, okay. I promise."
Bandit, Chilli, Bingo: "Good!"
Bluey: "Now go!"
Bluey covers her eyes again.
Bluey: "One!"
Bandit runs off."
Bandit: "Aaah!"
Chilli shakes Bingo, who giggles. Bluey continues to count.
Bluey: "Two! Three! Four!"
Chilli: "Aah! Bingo, she's counting! Quick, we have to hide!"
Bluey: "Five! Six!"
Chilli and Bingo run off.
Chilli, Bingo: "Aaaah!"
Bluey: "Seven!"
Cut to the interior of the playroom. Bandit calls back as he runs out of the room.
Bandit: "Don't get distracted!"
Bluey: (off screen) "Eight! Nine!"
Chilli runs past.
Chilli: "Eeeeeee!"
Bluey: (off screen) "Ten! Eleven!"
Bingo runs after her, but spots a basket of toys. She gasps and then jumps into the basket.
Bingo: "Urgh!
Bluey: (off screen) "Twelve! Thirteen! Fourteen! Fifteen!"
Cut to the hallway. Bandit stops in front of the linen closet, his feet squeaking on the floor. His tail wags as he spots the empty top shelf.
Bandit: "Ooh!"
Cut to the main bathroom. Chilli vocalizes uncertainly as she looks around.
Bluey: (off screen) "Sixteen! Seventeen!"
Chilli: "Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Aaah!"
Cut back to Bluey, finishing her count.
Bluey: "Eighteen! Ninteen! Twenty!"
She uncovers her eyes.
Bluey: "Ready or not, here I come!"
She runs into the playroom. Bingo ducks deeper into the basket of toys.
Bluey: "Now, where could they be hiding?"
She spots a tennis ball on the floor.
Bluey: "Ooh, a tennis ball."
She picks it up.
Bluey: "Oh! Don't get distracted, Bluey."
She tosses the tennis ball over her shoulder and walks away.
Bluey: "Hmm..."
Bingo peeks out of the basket, from her cover under a toy octopus.
Bingo: "Hee hee!"
Cut to the living room. Bluey walks through the frame.
Bluey: "Hmm. No one here."
Cut to the laundry room. Bluey walks through.
Bluey: "They're hiding really well."
She opens the cabinet under the laundry sink.
Bluey: "Anyone in here?"
Cut to the interior of the cabinet. A colorful robotic bird toy opens its eyes, and begins playing jaunty music and chirping.
Bluey: "Chattermax!"
Bluey picks up Chattermax. Chattermax squawks, flaps his wings, and swings his feet. Bluey hugs it.
Bluey: "I thought I'd lost you."
Chattermax: "Chatta-cha! Chattermax! Feed me!"
Bluey laughs.
Bluey: "Are you hungry, Chattermax?"
Chattermax: "Feed me!"
Chattermax's music stops playing.
Bluey: "I'd like to feed you, but I'm supposed to be playing Hide and Seek."
Chattermax: "Chibba-cha! Chibba, chibba, chibba!"
Bluey: "Okay, I'll just give you a quick little feed."
Chattermax begins to chatter again, flapping his wings and playing music again. Bluey laughs. Chattermax continues to chatter and play music as they walk away.
"I wonder why you were shoved under the sink."
Bluey carries Chattermax into the playroom.
Chattermax: "Feed me!"
Bluey: "Now, where are those things you eat?"
Bluey sets Chattermax down and begins to rummage through the basket where Bingo is hiding.
Chattermax: "Caw, caw! Chattermax hungry!"
Bluey: "Ugh, Chattermax, I know. I'm looking!"
Bluey knocks the octopus out of the basket, revealing Bingo. Bingo looks at Bluey nervously.
Bluey: "Aha! Found you!"
Bingo winces. Bluey runs right past Bingo, to the shelf.
Bluey: "Chattersnax!"
She retrieves a handful of heart-shaped bits of plastic. Chattermax continues to babble as she kneels down next to him. She feeds him the bits of plastic.
"There you go."
Chattermax: "Om nom! Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum! 
Bingo looks at the camera, resigned.
Chattermax: "Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum! Yum, yum, yum! Chattersnax!"
Bluey pats Chattermax's head.
Bluey: "Now, I have to get back to—"
Chattermax: "Toilet! Toilet! Chattermax need toilet!"
Bluey giggles.
Bluey: "Oh, Chattermax!"
She picks up Chattermax, and carries him out of the room.
Chattermax: "Chattermax need poo-poo, poo-poo!"
Bingo pulls the end of a feather boa over her head.
Cut to the hall toilet. From offscreen, Chattermax babbles and starts to beep urgently.
Chattermax: "Poo-poo! Poo-poo! Poo-poo!"
Bluey runs in, and sets Chattermax on the toilet.
Bluey: "There you go. You do your toilet."
Chattermax beings playing music and fart. Bits of plastic can be heard splashing into the toilet bowl.
Bluey: "Ooh, good Chattermax. I'll leave you to it."
Chattermax continues playing music and farting as Bluey walks away.
Cut to the hall closet, where Bandit has climbed up onto the top shelf. Bluey struts in.
Bluey: ♫ "Doo, doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-oo." ♫
She stops in front of the closet.
Bluey: "Now, what was I doing again?"
The music plays a dramatic note, as the camera zooms in on Bluey and Bandit, just out of her line of sight. The camera and music snaps back to normal as Chattermax interrupts.
Chattermax: (off screen) "Finish toilet! Finish toileeet!"
Bluey: "Oh, Chattermax is gonna need help to wash his hands."
Bluey runs out of the shot. Bandit rolls his eyes.
Cut to the main bathroom. Chilli stands in the glass shower cubicle. She drags her finger through a spot on the door. The glass squeaks.
Chilli: "This shower is filthy."
Bluey walks in, carrying Chattermax.
Chilli: "Ooh!"
Chilli presses herself against the back wall of the shower.
Chattermax babbles as Bluey carries him to the sink.
Bluey: "Yes, that's very interesting."
She sets him on the sink.
Bluey :"Wash, wash, wash. There you go, Chattermax. No germs."
Bluey: "Now, I have to go back to, um..."
Chilli, just out of her field of view, winces.
Bluey: "Aah! I forgot what I was doing!"
Chattermax starts chattering again, playing music, and vibrates off the sink. Bluey catches her.
Bluey: "Oh, well. I'll just play with you instead."
Bluey walks out, carrying Chattermax. Chilli facepalms.
Cut to the verandah. In the foreground, the dragonfly rests on a leaf. Out of focus behind it, Bluey has set up a tea party with Chattermax, Polly Puppy, and the blue-tongued lizard plush. The dragonfly flies off, and focus shifts to Bluey and her tea party.
Bluey: (fancily) "Oh, it's so nice to see you again, Polly. I want to hear all about your holiday to Egypt."
Chattermax: "Cha!"
Bluey: (as Polly) "Oh, yes, it was wonderful!"
Bluey: "Would you like milk with your tea?"
Bluey: (as Polly) "Oh, yes, please!"
Bluey pours pretend tea into Polly's cup.
Bluey: "There you go, Polly."
Bluey turns to the lizard plush.
Bluey: "And what about you, Gerald?"
Chattermax begins to play a louder, techno version of its music. It deploys a crest of feathers with pulsing lights, and its belly and eye spots begin to flash as well. It begins to dance in circles, chattering.
Bluey: (yelling over Chattermax) "Chattermax, this is a tea party, not a dancing party! Keep it down!"
Chattermax dances right through the middle of the tea party, knocking over all the china, and Polly Puppy. 
Bluey: "No!"
Bluey sets Polly Puppy back upright.
Bluey: (as Polly) "I'm so sorry about my husband!"
Chattermax continues, kicking the china around even further.
Bluey: "Aah, stop! Stop!"
Bluey: (as Polly) "Oh, he always does this."
Bluey: "Ugh, I'm sorry, Chattermax, but you're impossible to play with."
She picks him up.
Bluey: "I'm just gonna switch you off for a bit."
She turns him around, looking for an off switch.
Bluey: "Aah! There's no off button!"
Chattermax beings chattering even more incessantly.
Bluey: (yelling) "Mum! Can you take out Chattermax's batteries?!"
There is no response. Bluey glares at Chattermax.
Bluey: "Quiet, Chattermax!"
She starts to walk away, carrying Chattermax.
Bluey: "Mum!"
Cut to Bluey and Bingo's bedroom. Bluey walks in through the verandah door.
Bluey: "Mum! Where are you?!"
Cut to the hallway. Bluey walks past the closet. Bandit watches her pass.
Bluey: "Dad! Dad!"
Cut to the play room. Bluey walks past Bingo's basket.
Bluey: "Bingooo! Bingo!"
Bluey walks out to the verandah again.
Bluey: (yelling) "Why isn't anyone answering me?!"
Bluey leans away from Chattermax as he flails about even harder.
Bluey: "Ugh, Chattermax, that's enough!"
She walks down the stairs to the back yard. She carries Chattermax over to the corner with the meditating gnome.
Bluey: "Where could they all be? Okay, I need to figure this out."
Bluey looks at the gnome. The camera cuts to a close-up of the gnome, and then to Bluey's face.
Bluey sits down cross-legged. Chattermax dances in a circle around her as she imitates the gnome's pose and closes her eyes. Chattermax's music and chattering fade away, and the scene fades into soft pastels. Another Bluey appears behind her, covering her eyes and counting.
Bluey: "One! Two! Three! Four!"
Bluey opens her eyes.
Bluey: "Oh, yeah, that's right."
Bluey runs into the playroom. She pulls the boa off of Bingo.
Bluey: "Found you!"
Bingo: "Hooray!"
Bluey runs into the bathroom, where Chilli is on her hands and knees, scrubbing the shower with a sponge. Bluey points at Chilli.
Bluey: "Found you!"
Bluey runs into the hall, where Bandit is hiding in the closet, watching a video on his phone. Bluey points at him.
Bluey: "Found you!"
Startled, Bandit drops his phone.
Bandit: "Aaaah!"
Cut to the back porch. Bandit, Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo sit on the deck and laugh.
Bandit: "Oh, man. I had a Christmas tree stuck in my back the whole time."
Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli laugh.
Bluey: "Can you believe I got distracted and forgot we were playing Hide and Seek?"
Bandit, Bingo, Chilli: "Yes!"
Bandit, Bingo and Chilli laugh. Bluey smiles widely.
Bandit: "It's very believable."
Bluey laughs.
Bingo: "Now you hide, and I'll seek."
Bandit, Bluey, Chilli: "Okay."
Bingo covers her eyes and begins counting.
Bingo: "One! Two!"
Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey get up to run. Bandit tickles Bluey briefly before he starts running.
Bluey: "Eeee!"
Bandit: "Whoooa!"
Bingo: "Three! Four!"
Chilli and Bluey run through the play room.
Bingo: (off screen) "Five!"
Bluey: "Come on! You have to hide quick!"
Bingo: (off screen) "Six! Seven!"
Bluey: "Bingo can only count to fourteen.
Bingo: (off screen) "Eight!"
Bluey spots a dragonfly outside the window.
Bluey: "Oooh, a dragonfly."
The music and Bingo's countin stops, as Bluey stares at the dragonfly for a moment. Then she turns away.
Bingo: (off screen) "Ten!"
Bluey: "Come on!"
Bluey runs out of the room. Chilli looks at her proudly.
Bingo: (off screen) "Eleven! Twelve!"
Chilli runs out of the playroom.
Cut back to Bingo on the back porch.
Bingo: "Thirteen! Fourteen!"
She uncovers her eyes, and looks around uncertainly.
Bingo: "Um... Ready or not, here I come!"
Bingo runs off.
Cut to the pantry cupboard. The door is cracked, and Bluey and Chilli can just be seen, hiding inside. Bingo runs up, and spins around, scanning the room.
Bingo: "Hmm. Where could they be?"
Cut to the interior of the pantry cupboard. Bingo and Chilli sit on the floor, with their arms around their knees.
Bingo: (off screen) "Maybe they're in the bin!"
The bin lid thumps. Bluey and Chilli giggle, then shush each other.
Bingo: (off screen) "Not in here."
The bin lid thumps again.
Chilli: (whispering) "Oh, Bluey, what did you do with Chattermax?"
Bluey: "Oh, don't worry. I put him somewhere really peaceful."
Cut to a close-up of the dragonfly. It lands on Chattermax's beak. Chattermax is still, sitting next to the meditating gnome. He twitches.
Chattermax: "Chatta!"
Bingo: (offscreen) "Maybe they're in here!"
Bluey and Chilli scream.
Bingo: "Found yoooou!"
A new arrangement of the episode theme, featuring wordless vocalizations plays over the end credits as Bluey dances.
