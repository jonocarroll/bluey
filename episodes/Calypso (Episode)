We open to the inside of a school where the teacher, an Australian Shepherd dog called Calypso, is just wrapping up a story for the kids. Among the students are Bluey, Coco, Indy, Rusty, Honey, Chloe, Pretzel and the Terriers. Calypso pulls up a cloud backdrop to reveal a sunny background with a smiling sun. A rainbow comes up as well after a second.
Calypso: And the rain stopped, and out came the sun.
The students express their amazement over the story.
Students: Oooh!
Calypso starts to sing as the kids get up and walk away to start their games. Honey approaches a basket with some hills, trees and other things inside. She grabs a tree and hill and walks off.
♪ Sister Rain has left ♪
Bluey pulls a table to the right.
♪ And Father Sun is home ♪
Indy, Chloe and Coco walk towards a small covering just a bit too small for three pups to be in at the same time. The three of them are carrying baby plushes. They enter and sit down. Rusty grabs some wood and starts pulling a stand away.
♪ Brother Wind
comes blowing in ♪
The Terriers grab some pillows to begin building a fort for themselves.
♪ To welcome home

Calypso hums alongside an instrumental part of her song. Pretzel walks in from the left, slowly and tiredly. After a couple of steps, he lays himself down on a green rug with a grunt.
The title card appears. This episode of Bluey is called: Calypso. Above the title is a gnome plush.
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called... Calypso!
Calypso walks towards a table and a chair, sitting down on the chair. She offers Pretzel the stick.
Calypso: Look at this lovely stick I found, Pretzel.
She sets the stick down and starts preparing to knit.
Pretzel: I don't feel like playing anything.
Calypso: Okay.
Honey walks in from the left.
Honey: Calypso, can I please have a gnome for my village?
Calypso gets up from her chair and walks with Honey to see her village.
Calypso: Well, let's have a look.
They approach the big white rug where the village materials were. On the white rug is a tree and a hill. Honey presents her work-in-progress village. We see a closeup on it.
Calypso: Well, the gnome will need a place to sleep, So...
Honey runs over to the basket and starts digging through it.
Honey: Okay.
Calypso walks off while humming. She passes by Bluey, who is running a pretend fish and chips shop.
Calypso: You busy, Bluey?
Calypso picks up a purple pillow that was on the floor.
Bluey: No, not yet. This is a fish and chip shop, but we've run out of fish, so it's just chips.
Calypso: Okay. Well, be patient.
Calypso walks off while holding the pillow. She then approaches the small house where Chloe, Indy and Coco live. Chloe pretends to be tired.
Chloe: Oh, I had no sleep all night.
Indy accidentally bumps into Coco.
Coco: Ooh!
Indy: Ooh, sorry, Coco.
Calypso peeks inside the house.
Calypso: My, it certainly is crowded in here.
Indy: It sure is. I might have to move out soon.
Calypso: Did you know that a fish and chip shop just opened next door?
Chloe: Did you hear that, Roderick? We'll have to pop over.
Calypso walks towards Rusty, who is building a house out of wood.
Calypso: That looks good.
Rusty: I'm building a house. It's going to have a bottom room and a top room.
Calypso: Wonderful! I think Indy is looking for somewhere to live.
Rusty gives some thought to that.
Rusty: Hmm.
Calypso walks past a fort made out of cushions. On the cushions are two shields on them. A few stick horses poke out from the left side of the fort.
Calypso: And the Terriers have made another fort.
Medium Grey Terrier: We're Romans!
She stops walking.
Calypso: I can see. Now, you are here to protect the kingdom?
Light Grey Terrier: Yes, Calypso!
Calypso: That's good.
Calypso starts to walk off again.
Dark Grey Terrier: Do you need protecting?
Calypso: Not right now, thanks.
Calypso returns to her chair and sits down. Pretzel is still laying on the carpet, rubbing his finger on it. He lays on his back.
Pretzel: Ugh!
Honey walks up to Calypso.
Honey: Calypso, can I please have a gnome now?
Calypso gets up and pets Honey's head.
Calypso: Let's have a look.
The two walk off to see the village once more. The village now has a house on top of the hill.
Honey: I made a place for her to sleep.
Calypso: Lovely, but... She'll also need a forest for her morning walk.
Honey: Oh, yeah!
Honey looks over at the basket excitedly. We cut to Chloe and Coco taking care of their babies.
Coco: You cheeky baby. You're so beautiful.
Indy runs up to Bluey with her baby in a papoose.
Indy: Hi, Bluey!
Bluey: Hi!
Indy: Ooh, you have so many customers.
Bluey: I know! I'm so busy. What's going on with you?
Indy: I'm moving out.
Bluey: Ooh! Where to?
Indy: I don't know.
Rusty comes running in.
Rusty: Hi, Indy! Do you want to move into my house?
Indy: Yeah!
We cut to Rusty's finished house. The pair walk in as Rusty introduces her to the place.
Rusty: You can rent the upstairs room for 10 dollarbucks.
Indy: Great! But I don't have any dollarbucks.
Rusty: Hmm. Maybe you need a job.
Indy: Yeah! I could be a waitress for Bluey. Can you mind Polly?
Indy pulls Polly out of her papoose and hands her to Rusty. Rusty takes her in his arms.
Rusty: Sure.
Indy leaves to go to her job.
Indy: Bye!
Rusty: Do you want to learn how to build a fence, Polly?
Cut back to the Terriers' fort. The Terriers are on lookout duty, searching for any invaders. Indy walks past, and the Terriers look over at her, tails wagging.
Light Grey Terrier: Indy! Do you need protecting?
Indy: Not right now, thanks!
Light Grey Terrier: Okay!
The Terriers hide in their fort. Cut back to Calypso, who is preparing to knit while humming her gnome song. Pretzel is laying on his side now, facing the wall. Honey comes in again, walking up to Calypso.
Honey: Calypso, can I have a gnome nowwwww?
Calypso: Well, let's have a look.
Calypso gets up again to go see Honey's village. Cut to Honey's village, which now has some trees added to it.
Calypso: Well, it's looking wonderful! Is there anything else you can think of that a gnome might enjoy?
Honey: Hmmm. Yes!
Honey gets an idea and gets to work on improving her village. We cut back to Bluey's restaurant where Coco and Chloe are
tending to their babies. Indy walks in, carrying a tray with some cups of tea.
Indy: Here's your cups of tea.
Indy sets the tray on the table, passing cups of tea to Coco and Chloe.
Calypso: Thank you. Are the fish and chips almost ready?
Indy: Almost. But we're out of fish.
Bluey: Oh, Indy, here's your dollarbucks for being my waitress.
Indy walks up to Bluey and takes a few green toys, acting as money.
Indy: Thanks, Bluey.
Cut back to Rusty's house. Rusty is galloping around while clicking, having Polly on his back. He stops when Indy comes in.
Indy: Hi, Rusty. Here's my dollarbucks for the upstairs room. 
Rusty takes the small green toys and puts them away. Indy passes him a gray and white parcel.
Indy: And I brought you some chips.
Rusty: Thanks!
Indy: Okay, I'll just get back to work.
Indy walks off to return to work.
Rusty: Do you want some chips, Polly?
Cut back to the Terriers' fort. They're still on the lookout for invaders as Indy walks past them.
Light Grey Terrier: Do you need protecting yet?
Indy: Not yet!
Terriers: Okay!
Indy stops walking and looks at them.
Indy: Actually... would you like some fish and chips, Terriers?
Dark Grey Terrier: Yes, please! Can we have enough to feed our whole army?
Indy: Okay. But it might just be chips, because we're out of fish.
Terriers: Okay!
Cut back to Bluey's shop, where Bluey is tending to a pot.
Indy: Bluey, the Terriers want enough fish and chips to feed an army.
Bluey: Wow! Okay. How about these are all sacks of chips?
She spots a stack of pillows and drags them over to Indy.
Indy: Yeah!
Bluey starts handing over pillow after pillow to Indy.
Bluey: One sack, two sacks, three sacks.
Cut to Pretzel, who is laying on his back while kicking the wall one foot at a time. Calypso is humming her gnome song still, while tying together some string to crochet something.Honey walks up to Calypso and wordlessly asks her to come. Calypso pokes her nose and gets up to go with her to see her village one more time. She walks over, humming with her eyes closed. She gasps at what she sees.
Calypso: Look at this!
We zoom out to see Honey's village, now greatly expanded upon with houses, trees, hills, lakes and a big stump at its centre.Honey wags her tail and looks over at the village with Calypso. Triumphant music plays over the next close-ups shown. We see close-up shots on the village, with a person in a pagoda by a lake and some hills. We see another close-up where one person is fishing at a lake while another crosses a bridge. The third close-up showing a downtown area of the village, showing some people crossing the street while others eat at a restaurant nearby. The next close-up shows two people with babies swaddled up by them talk to a person who works as a grocer in another part of town. The fifth and final close-up shots show a parent leading their children down a crosswalk.
Calypso: This is beautiful!
Coco, Chloe and Rusty walk in to admire the village.
Coco, Chloe and Rusty: Oooh!
Honey: Is it ready for a gnome to come and live here?
Calypso: Of course it is. Look at it!
She laughs a bit. Honey laughs and runs off to grab a gnome for her village. Calypso starts to hum again as Honey picks out
a gnome. We cut back to the Terriers' fort where the Terriers are starting to get bored with no invaders in sight. The light
grey terrier snaps to attention.
Light Grey Terrier: Being protecting Romans is a little bit boring.
Dark Grey Terrier: Maybe we should be... invading Romans!
Medium Grey Terrier: Mmm, maybe.
Cut back to Bluey's restaurant, where Bluey is giving Indy the last few sacks of chips to Indy.
Bluey: Five sacks! Six sacks! There you go, Indy. Take them to the Terriers.
Indy: Okay, Bluey!
Indy starts to slowly walk off to deliver the chip sacks to the Terriers. Honey places the gnome at the centre of the village
as Rusty looks on.
Honey: The gnome watches over all the people.
Honey gasps as she sees Indy slowly come in, holding the chip sacks. Unfortunately, the sacks of chips are blocking Indy's vision, so she doesn't realise that she is about to step on Honey's village.
Honey: Indy, no!
Several students shout to try and get Indy's attention before it's too late.
Honey: You're gonna step on my village!
Calypso calls for the Terriers.
Calypso: Terriers!
The Terriers snap to attention.
Terriers: Hut!
Calypso: The village needs protecting!
They get out of the fort, holding shields. They then run off towards the village.
Terriers: Hut!
They halt Indy just before the village by forming a defensive pose.
Terriers: Tortoise formation!
Calypso and the students cheer and celebrate.
Everyone: Yeah!
Rusty: Good one, Terriers!
The Terriers stop their defense and smile at the others.
Terriers: Hut!
Indy moves her head so that she can see, spotting the Terriers.
Indy: Oh. Hi, Terriers. Here's your chips. Sorry, we're out of fish.
Calypso and the students share a laugh. Calypso returns to her seat while humming.
Calypso: Well, thank goodness for the Terriers.
She continues crocheting until she hears a voice pipe up.
Pretzel: Well, I guess you can sit in my boat, if you want.
Pretzel is now sitting on the rug while holding the stick, pretending to be a fisherman.
Calypso: Oh. Thanks. I won't take up much room.
Pretzel: I'm a fisherman.
Calypso: Mm. I can see. Have you caught anything?
Pretzel: Not yet.
Calypso: Well, just be patient. They'll bite eventually.
Calypso pauses for a moment.
Calypso: Oh. If you do catch a fish, let me know.
Pretzel: Oh, okay. Why?
Calypso: Because there's someone I'd like you to meet...
Calypso looks back over at Bluey and the other students. The credits roll, and the triumphant theme when the completed village was first shown plays over them. Instead of Bluey dancing, we see Pretzel pretending to fish with the stick.
