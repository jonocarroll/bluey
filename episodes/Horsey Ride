The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. Bluey is humming to herself as she sits in the playroom with her toy Polly Puppy.
Bluey: Today, Polly, the cousins are coming over. Mum and Aunt Trixie are gonna play hockey. (whisper) That means we can play horsey with Dad and Uncle Stripe. (holds up Polly) Is that gonna be fun? (as Polly) Yeah, I think so. (as herself) Oh, good Polly Puppy.
She hugs Polly. The doorbell rings.
Muffin: (offscreen, distantly yelling past the door) Bluey!
The doorbell keeps being rung repeatedly.
Bluey: They're here!
Bluey runs to the door, Polly Puppy still in hand, giggling. She only manages to open the door a small crack before Chilli pushes it back shut with her field hockey stick. The doorbell is still being rung. Although muffled, Muffin yelling "Bluey! Open the door!" and Socks howling can be heard.
Chilli: Bluey, last time the cousins visited, you got upset because they spilled passionfruit all over Polly Puppy.
Bluey: Oh yeah, I better put her away.
Chilli: 'Cause she's your special puppy.
Bluey: Yes, I'll put her in my room.
Bluey runs towards the stairs as Bandit and Bingo approach.
Bandit: Oh, there's my watermelon!
Bandit picks up Bluey, holding her horizontally as he pretends to nibble her stomach. Bluey screams as Polly Puppy flies out of her hands and lands on the floor.
Bandit: Nom nom nom nom!
The camera briefly zooms in on the abandoned Polly Puppy before transitioning back to the entry hall as Bandit sets Bluey back to the ground. Stripe, Muffin, and Trixie carrying Socks have now entered. Muffin is wearing thongs/sandals.
Trixie: G'day, Bingo. G'day, Bluey. Hello, Bandit.
Bluey and Bingo: Hi.
Stripe: (playfully pointing finger guns) Hey kids, how're ya goin'? (waves to Bandit) Hey brother.
Bandit: (waves back) Hey.
Trixie: (looks down at Muffin) Ooh, show Aunt Chilli your thongs, Muffin.
Muffin: Aunt Chilli, I'm wearing thongs! (raises her left foot and points to it)
Chilli: Oh, great! Hello, Socks.
Chilli reaches a finger towards Socks, who, growling, nips at it. Chilli recoils with a yelp as Socks, yipping, squirms out of Trixie's arms and runs off. Still barking, she stops near the stairwell where she find the dropped Polly Puppy toy, jumping on and starting to chew on it.
The scene switches back to the entry hall as Trixie and Chilli are leaving the house.
Chilli: Okay kids, Aunt Trix and I are off to play hockey. Have fun with Dad and Uncle Stripe.
Muffin and Bingo look back smiling as the two dads start to look concerned. Their attention is drawn back as all three kids return Trixie and Chilli's wave.
Trixie: See ya, kids. (muttered under her breath to Chilli) Quick, let's get out of here.
Bluey and Bandit: Bye!
Stripe: (in sync with Bluey and Bandit) See ya!
Bingo: See ya later!
As Trixie and Chilli leave, Bandit kneels down to the girls' level.
Bandit: All right, girls, who wants to sit on the couch and watch cricket?!
Bluey: (shouting) Noooo!
Bingo and Muffin: Not me!
Muffin: No way!
Bluey: Let's play horsey ride!
All kids: Yeah!
As the kids run off giggling, Bandit and Stripe sigh defeatedly.
Stripe: Well, we gave it a shot.
TITLE CARD - Polly Puppy, surrounded by some flower petals and stuffing and the episode title
Bingo : This episode of Bluey is called: 
Bluey : Horsey Ride!
The scene transitions to the backyard, where Bluey is leading Stripe and Bandit, who are crawling along the ground on all fours, by a jump rope they are holding in their mouths. Muffin is riding on top of Stripe and Bingo is on top of Bandit. Both riders are giggling.
Bluey: Giddyup, Sparkles! (waves the jump rope) 
Stripe, playing "Sparkles", neighs.
Bluey: Giddyup, Gallahop! (waves the jump rope again)
Bandit, playing "Gallahop", neighs, snorts, and clicks his tongue. The two "horses" stop right before the steps to the tiled patio. "Sparkles" neighs again and "Gallahop" lets out a nicker.
Bluey: (waves the jump rope again) Come on, horsies. Giddyup! (another wave of the rope)
"Sparkles" and "Gallahop" both nicker in protest.
Muffin: (kicks "Sparkles"'s side) When I do this, it means giddyup!
All kids: Giddyup!
Both "horses" nicker in protest as Bluey leads them up the stairs. As they walk along the patio, they break character with pained grunts.
Bluey: Horsies love tiles.
The "horses" stop.
Muffin: (patting "Sparkles"'s head) Sparkles needs more sparkles on her.
Bluey: Ooh, I'll get some glitter. (drops the jump rope and runs off)
"Sparkles" neighs in distress as "Gallahop" gives a laughing neigh at "her" misfortune.
The scene transitions back to the playroom, where Socks is still growling and gnawing on Polly Puppy as Bluey runs in.
Bluey: (screaming) Aaaah! Polly Puppy!
The scene cuts back to the yard. Bingo and Muffin have dismounted, sitting back and watching as the "horses" butt heads with each other, whinnying.
Bluey: (crying out from off screen) Daaaad!
Cut back to the playroom as Bluey is trying to tug Polly Puppy away from Socks.
Bluey: Let go, Socks!
The rest of the Heelers enter. Bandit and Stripe are standing upright again.
Bandit: Hey, hey. Okay, chill the beans, everyone.
Bluey loses the tug of war, letting go of Polly as Socks continues to chew.
Bluey: (points accusingly at Socks) Socks won't let go of Polly Puppy! (stomps her foot)
Muffin: Socks, let Polly go. It's Bluey's special toy!
Stripe: Let me try. (kneels down to Sock's level as she growls) Hey there, Rocksocks, how about we-
As Stripe tries to reach for Polly, Socks nips at him. He recoils.
Stripe: Ow! (shrugs and steps back) Well, I'm out of ideas.
Muffin: I put all my special toys away when my cousins come over. You should've done that, Bluey.
Bandit: Good idea, Muffin.
Bluey: I was going to do that, but then you ate me like a watermelon and I got distracted.
Bandit has a concerned look of realization as Stripe glares at him.
Bandit: No point playing the blame game. We need a solution.
Bluey: Something for Socks that's even more fun than Polly Puppy.
Bingo: What about a horsey ride?
Muffin: Or two horsey rides?
Bluey: What if we had a horsey wedding?
All kids, sans Socks: Yee!
Bluey: Sparkles can marry Gallahop!
Bandit: Huh?
Bingo: And we could make confetti.
Bandit: What?
Muffin: And invite Socks!
Stripe: What was that?
All kids, sans Socks: Yeah!
Bluey, Bingo, and Muffin join hands in a circle, chanting "Horsey Wedding!"
Stripe: Aw, man...
The scene transitions to the backyard where the wedding venue has been set up. Six white chairs are set up, three on each side, on either side of a long argyle rug. Five out of six chairs are taken by stuffed animals and one in the front row is left open. The center rug "aisle" leads up to a smaller zigzag patterned rug. Bluey is sitting on a stool in front of a toy keyboard. Bingo, wearing a heart bopper headband is standing by an open cookbook. Bandit is back in horse position as "Gallahop", wearing a purple top hat and a red bow tie. Bluey presses a star-shaped button as the keyboard plays a basic upbeat tune, the two sisters bobbing their heads to it.
Bluey: (into the toy microphone on the keyboard, with some feedback) Socks! We'd like to invite you to the wedding of Sparkles and Gallahop!
Socks stops gnawing on Polly Puppy, looking up curious, before returning to what she was doing.
Bluey: Hmm. Bring out Sparkles!
Bluey presses the star button again, the keyboard now playing Mendelssohn's "Wedding March". Stripe, on all fours as "Sparkles", is now covered in more glitter and is wearing a fluffy flowered heaband with a see-through veil dangling behind him. Muffin leads him along the rug "aisle", tossing a bunch of petals in the air. "Gallahop" smiles as "Sparkles" stops by his side and Muffin takes a seat.
Bandit: I'm the luckiest horse in the world.
Muffin: Horsies can't talk.
Bingo: (clears her throat) Ladies and gentlemen, may Sparkles marry Gallahop today.
Muffin claps.
Bluey: (through the microphone) Socks! The wedding has started!
Cut back briefly to Socks still snarling and chewing on Polly Puppy.
Bluey: It's not working. Get them to say some things.
Bluey presses the star button to stop the music.
Bingo: You may now say some things.
Stripe: Uh... I'm not marrying him. He stinks.
Bandit: (gasps and fake sobs) My heart is breaking.
Muffin: I said, horsies can't talk!
Bandit: Oh, I mean... (neighs sadly)
Bluey: Let them get married!
Bingo: You may now get married.
"Sparkles" neighs in protest. Muffin gets up from her seat.
Muffin: She said, you now get married!
Bluey: (through the mic) You have to say "I do!"
Muffin: Yeah, but in horsey talk!
All three kids glaring at the couple, Bluey presses the star button again, cuing a drumroll. "Gallahop" nickers at "Sparkles" with a flirtatious look, causing "Sparkles" to buck up and neigh in panic. The three kids scream, Bluey falling off her stool and knocking down the keyboard, as "Sparkles" turns and runs the other way, knocking over chairs along the way.
Bingo: Sparkles!
Bluey: No! (gets up and runs after "Sparkles") Come back, Sparkles! You have to do it properly!
Bingo and Muffin join the chase as "Gallahop" is left behind letting out a sobbing whinny. "Sparkles" runs into the house whinnying, causing Socks to stop chewing on Polly Puppy.
Bluey: Come back, Sparkles!
Muffin: Marry Gallahop!
Bingo: Now!
The scene transitions to the kitchen. "Sparkles" ducks behind the counter as the girls run past.
Bluey: I want Polly back.
"Sparkles" peeks back up over the counter, letting out a soft sigh of relief as he heads off in the other direction. The scene transitions to the girls running into Bandit and Chilli's room.
Bluey: Where'd he go?
The girls pause as they hear chattering from the television in the distance. The scene transitions to the living room where "Sparkles" is contentedly watching a cricket match on the TV before Bluey bursts in.
Bluey: He's watching the cricket! Get him!
The girls chase "Sparkles" out of the room and into the playroom. He encounters Socks, who, releasing Polly Puppy, begins to bark and growl att at him aggressively. "Sparkles" bucks up defensively, neighing. After a loud bark from Socks, "Sparkles" backs down, whimpering, giving Bingo and Muffin a chance to tackle him, laughing. Socks hops up and down excitedly.
Muffin and Bingo: Good one, Socks!
Bluey tiptoes past towards Polly Puppy, hugging her in her arms. Stripe and Bluey wink at each other. Socks is now on top of the heap, howling. The scene transitions back to the backyard wedding.
Bandit: (fake sobs) I'd been looking forward to this day all my life and now it's ruined.
Socks is barking and growling, leading a very scared "Sparkles" back to "Gallahop" before panting excitedly. The rest of the girls return to their positions at the wedding. "Gallahop" glares at his bride. "Sparkles" neighs in apology, but "Gallahop" only scoffs. Bluey presses the button on her keyboard to restart the drumroll.
Bingo: You may now say "I do."
"Sparkles" and "Gallahop" exchange nervous glances as the drumroll stops.
The scene transitions to Chilli and Trixie re-entering the house.
Trixie: Well, I guess that's why we wear mouth guards.
As Chilli sets down her bag, the girls are heard squealing excited in the background as "Wedding March" plays again.
Trixie: Well, that sounds positive.
The rest of the Heelers re-enter the foyer, Bluey carrying Polly Puppy. Stripe dusts himself off as Bingo and Muffin hug Chilli and Trixie respectively.
Chilli: What have you kids been up to?
Bandit: Oh, you know, just regular childhood games.
Bingo: Uncle Stripe married Dad!
Bluey: Yeah!
Trixie: Oh, really?
Chilli and Trixie laugh, as Socks howls and the rest of the girls resume their earlier "Horsey Wedding!" chant with joined hands.
Bandit: (shrugs) Well, who could blame him?
Stripe simply shakes his head.
The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - an up-tempo, percussion-heavy tune. Bluey is dancing.
