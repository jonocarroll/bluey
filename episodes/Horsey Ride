The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. Bluey is humming to herself as she sits in the playroom with her toy Polly Puppy.
Bluey: "Today, Polly, the cousins are coming over. Mum and Aunt Trixie are gonna play hockey. That means we can play horsey with Dad and Uncle Stripe."
Bluey holds up Polly.
Bluey: "Is that gonna be fun?:
She nods Polly's head.
Bluey: (as Polly) "Yeah, I think so."
Bluey: "Oh, good Polly Puppy."
She hugs Polly. The doorbell rings repeatedly. Distantly, someone pounds on the door.
Bluey: "They're here!"
Bluey runs out, giggling.
In the entry, Bluey runs to the door to the door, Polly Puppy still in hand. She only manages to open the door a small crack before Chilli pushes it shut with her field hockey stick. The pounding and ringing doorbell continue.
Muffin: (muffled) "Bluey! Open the door!"
Chilli: "Bluey, last time the cousins visited, you got upset because they spilled passionfruit all over Polly Puppy.
Bluey: "Oh yeah, I better put her away."
Chilli: "'Cause she's your special puppy."
Socks howls.
Bluey: "Yes! I'll put her in my room.
Bluey runs towards the stairs as Bandit and Bingo approach.
Bandit: "Oh, there's my watermelon!"
Bandit picks up Bluey, holding her horizontally as he pretends to nibble her stomach. Bluey screams as Polly Puppy flies out of her hands and lands on the floor.
Bandit: "Nom nom nom nom!"
The camera briefly zooms in on the abandoned Polly Puppy before transitioning back to the entry hall. Bandit sets Bluey back on the ground. Stripe, Muffin, and Trixie carrying Socks have now entered. Muffin is wearing thongs/sandals.
Trixie: "G'day, Bingo. G'day, Bluey. Hello, Bandit."
Bluey, Bingo: "Hi."
Stripe playfully points finger guns at Bluey and Bingo.
Stripe: "Hey kids, how're ya goin'? Hey brother."
He tosses an informal salute to Bandit, who returns an even sloppier salute.
Bandit: "Hey."
Trixie: "Ooh, show Aunt Chilli your thongs, Muffin."
Muffin: "Aunt Chilli, I'm wearing thongs!"
Muffin raises her left foot and points to it.
Chilli: "Oh, great! Hello, Socks."
Chilli reaches a finger towards Socks, who snarls and attempts to bite it. Chilli recoils with a yelp as Socks, yipping, squirms out of Trixie's arms and runs off.
Chilli: (muttering) "Far out."
Still barking, Socks stops near the stairwell where she find the dropped Polly Puppy toy. She pounces and starts to chew on it.
The scene switches back to the entry hall as Trixie and Chilli are leaving the house.
Chilli: "Okay kids, Aunt Trix and I are off to play hockey. Have fun with Dad and Uncle Stripe."
Muffin and Bingo look back smiling as the two dads start to look concerned. Their attention is drawn back as all three kids return Trixie and Chilli's wave.
Trixie: "See ya, kids."
Trixie: (muttering to Chilli) "Quick, let's get outta here."
Bluey, Bandit: "Bye!"
Stripe: "See ya!"
Bingo: "See ya later!"
As Trixie and Chilli leave, Bandit kneels down to the girls' level.
Bandit: (enthusiastically) "All right, girls, who wants to sit on the couch and watch cricket?!"
Bluey: (shouting) "Noooo!!!"
Bingo, Muffin: "Not me!"
Muffin: "No way!"
Bluey: "Let's play horsey ride!"
Muffin, Bingo, Bluey: "Yeah!"
As the kids run off giggling, Bandit and Stripe sigh defeatedly.
Stripe: "Well, we gave it a shot.
TITLE CARD - Polly Puppy, surrounded by some flower petals and stuffing and the episode title
Bingo : "This episode of Bluey is called:"
Bluey : "Horsey Ride!
The scene transitions to the backyard. Bingo and Muffin are riding Bandit and Stripe, respectively, who are down on all fours. They are holding a jump rope in their mouths, and Stripe has some glitter on him. Bluey holds the other end of the jump rope, leading them along. Bingo and Muffin are giggling.
Bluey: "Giddyup, Sparkles!"
She waves the jump rope. Stripe, playing "Sparkles", neighs.
Bluey: "Giddyup, Gallahop!"
Bluey waves the jump rope again. Bandit, playing "Gallahop", neighs, snorts, and clicks his tongue. The two "horses" stop right before the steps to the tiled patio. Stripe neighs again and Bandit lets out a nicker. Bluey waves the jump rope again.
Bluey: "Come on, horsies. Giddyup!"
She waves the jump rope again. Bandit and Stripe both nicker in protest, shaking their heads. Muffin kicks Stripe's sides.
Muffin: "When I do this, it means giddyup!"
Bingo, Muffin, Bluey: "Giddyup!
Both "horses" nicker in protest as Bluey leads them up the stairs. As they walk along the patio, they break character with pained grunts.
Bluey: "Horsies love tiles."
The "horses" stop. Muffin pats Stripe's head, hard.
Muffin: "Sparkles needs more sparkles on her."
Bluey: "Ooh, I'll get some glitter."
Bluey drops the jump rope and runs off. Stripe neighs in distress, and Bandit laughs horsily at his misfortune.
The scene transitions back to the playroom, where Socks is still growling and gnawing on Polly Puppy as Bluey runs in.
Bluey: "Aaaah!! Polly Puppy!"
The scene cuts back to the yard. Bingo and Muffin have dismounted, sitting back and watching as the "horses" butt heads with each other, whinnying.
Bluey: (offscreen) "Daaaad!"
Cut back to the playroom. Socks is biting down on Polly Puppy's ear, while Bluey pulls on Polly's legs.
Bluey: "Let go, Socks!
Bandit and Stripe run up, followed by Muffin and Bingo.
Bandit: "Hey, hey, okay. Chill the beans, everyone."
Bluey loses the tug of war, letting go of Polly. Socks continues to chew on the toy. Bluey points at her accusingly.
Bluey: "Socks won't let go of Polly Puppy!"
Bluey stomps her foot for emphasis.
Muffin: "Socks, let Polly go. It's Bluey's special toy!"
Socks continues growling and chewing on Polly.
Stripe: "Let me try."
Stripe kneels down next to Socks, who glares at him and growls threateningly.
Stripe: "Hey there, Rocks-Socks, how about we—"
Stripe begins to reach for Polly. Socks snaps at him, and he recoils.
Stripe: "Ow!"
He shrugs and steps away. Socks resumes mauling Polly Puppy.
Stripe: "Well, I'm out of ideas."
Muffin: "I put all my special toys away when my cousins come over. You should've done that, Bluey."
Bandit: "Good idea, Muffin."
Bluey: "I was going to do that, but then you ate me like a watermelon and I got distracted."
Bandit has a concerned look of realization as Stripe glares at him.
Bandit: "No point playing the blame game. We need a solution."
Bluey: "Something for Socks that's even more fun than Polly Puppy."
Bingo: "What about a horsey ride?"
Muffin: "Or two horsey wides?"
Bluey: "What if we had a horsey wedding?"
Bluey, Muffin, Bingo: "Yee!"
Bluey: "Sparkles can marry Gallahop!"
Bandit: "Huh?"
Bingo: "And we could make confetti."
Bandit: "What?"
Muffin: "And invite Socks!"
Stripe: "What was that?"
Bluey, Muffin, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bluey, Bingo, and Muffin join hands in a circle and begin to chant.
Bluey, Muffin, Bingo: "Horsey wedding! Horsey wedding! Horsey wedding!"
Stripe: "Aw, man..."
The scene transitions to the backyard where the wedding venue has been set up. Six white chairs are set up, three on each side, on either side of a long argyle rug. Five out of six chairs are taken by stuffed animals and one in the front row is left open. The center rug "aisle" leads up to a smaller zigzag patterned rug. Bluey is sitting on a stool in front of a toy keyboard. Bingo, wearing a heart bopper headband is standing by an open cookbook. Bandit is back on all fours as "Gallahop", wearing a purple top hat and a red bow tie. Bluey presses a star-shaped button as the keyboard plays a basic upbeat tune, the two sisters bobbing their heads to it.
Bluey: (into the toy microphone on the keyboard, with some feedback) "Socks! We'd like to invite you to the wedding of Sparkles and Gallahop!"
Socks stops gnawing on Polly Puppy, looking up curiously.
]: "Ruh?"
She resumes gnawing on Polly Puppy.
Bluey: "Hmm. Bring out Sparkles!"
Bluey presses the star button again, the keyboard now playing Mendelssohn's "Wedding March". Stripe, on all fours as "Sparkles", is now covered in more glitter and is wearing a fluffy flowered headband with a see-through veil dangling behind him. Muffin leads him along the rug "aisle", tossing a bunch of petals in the air. Bandit as "Gallahop" smiles as Stripe stops by his side and Muffin takes a seat.
Gallahop: "I'm the luckiest horse in the world."
Muffin: "Horsies can't talk."
Bingo clears her throat.
Bingo: "Ladies and gentlemen, may Sparkles marry Gallahop today."
Muffin claps.
Bluey: (through the microphone) "Socks! The wedding has started!"
Cut back briefly to Socks still snarling and chewing on Polly Puppy.
Bluey: "It's not working. Get them to say some things."
Bluey presses the star button to stop the music.
Bingo: "You may now say some things."
Sparkles: "Uh... I'm not marrying him. He stinks."
Bandit gasps and sobs unconvincingly.
Gallahop: (melodramatically) "My heart is breaking."
Muffin: "I said, horsies can't talk!"
Bandit: "Oh, I mean:"
Bandit: (sadly) "Neigh..."
Bluey: "Let them get married!"
Bingo: "You may now get married."
Stripe shakes his head.
Stripe: "Neigh!"
Muffin gets up from her seat and confronts Stripe.
Muffin: "She said, you now get mawwied!
Bluey: (through the mic) "You have to say 'I do!'"
Muffin: "Yeah, but in horsey talk!
All three kids glaring at the couple, Bluey presses the star button again, cuing a drumroll. Bandit nickers at Stripe with a flirtatious look, causing Stripe to buck up and neigh in panic. The three kids scream, Bluey falling off her stool and knocking down the keyboard, as Stripe turns and runs the other way, knocking over chairs along the way.
Bingo: "Sparkles!"
Bluey: "Nooo!"
Bluey gets to her feet.
Bluey: "Come back, Sparkles!"
She runs after Stripe.
Bluey: "You have to do it properly!"
Bingo and Muffin join the chase as Bandit is left behind letting out a sobbing whinny. Stripe runs into the house, whinnying. Socks stops chewing on Polly Puppy and watches him go. Bluey, Muffin, and Bingo run by in hot pursuit.
Bluey: "Come back, Sparkles!"
Muffin: "Marry Gallahop!"
Bingo: "Now!"
The scene transitions to the kitchen. Stripe ducks behind the counter as the girls run past.
Bluey: "I want Polly back."
Stripe peeks back up over the counter, letting out a soft whicker of relief as he heads off in the other direction. Cut to Bandit and Chilli's bedroom. Bluey, Muffin, and Bingo run in.
Bluey: "Where'd he go?"
The girls pause as they hear chattering from the television in the distance. The scene transitions to the living room where Stripe is contentedly watching a cricket match on the TV before Bluey bursts in.
Bluey: "He's watching the cricket! Get him!"
The girls chase Stripe out of the room and into the playroom. He skids to a stop in front of Socks, who releases Polly Puppy to bark and growl at him. Stripe rears up defensively, neighing. After a loud bark from Socks, he backs down, whimpering, giving Bingo and Muffin a chance to tackle him, laughing. Socks hops up and down excitedly.
Muffin, Bingo: "Good one, Socks!"
Bluey tiptoes past them and picks up Polly Puppy, giving her a hug. Stripe and Bluey wink at each other. Socks, now on top of the heap, howls. The scene transitions back to the backyard wedding.
Bandit: (sobbing) "I'd been looking forward to this day all my life and now it's ruined."
Stripe enters nervously, with Socks nipping at his heels. The rest of the girls return to their positions at the wedding. Bandit glares at his bride. Stripe neighs apologetically, but Bandit only scoffs. Bluey presses the button on her keyboard to restart the drumroll.
Bingo: "You may now say 'I do.'"
Bandit and Stripe exchange nervous glances as the drumroll stops.
The scene transitions to Chilli and Trixie re-entering the house.
Trixie: "Well, I guess that's why we wear mouth guards."
As Chilli sets down her bag, the girls are heard squealing excitedly in the background as "Wedding March" plays again.
Trixie: "Well, that sounds positive."
The rest of the Heelers re-enter the foyer, Bluey carrying Polly Puppy. Stripe dusts himself off as Bingo and Muffin hug Chilli and Trixie respectively.
Chilli: "What have you kids been up to?"
Bandit: "Oh, you know, just regular childhood games."
Bingo: "Uncle Stripe married Dad!"
Bluey: "Yeah!"
Trixie: "Oh, really?"
Chilli and Trixie laugh, as Socks howls and the rest of the girls resume their earlier "Horsey Wedding!" chant with joined hands. Bandit shrugs.
Bandit: "Well, who could blame him?"
Stripe rolls his eyes and shakes his head.
The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - an up-tempo, percussion-heavy tune. Bluey is dancing.
