The episode opens on an establishing shot of the Heeler's house, decorated for Christmas. Bandit hums Silent Night.
In the girls' bedroom, Bluey and Bingo lie in bed. Bandit kneels by Bingo's bedside, gently patting her. He reaches the end of the song, and, determining that she's asleep, carefully stands up. He tiptoes to the door. A floorboard creaks, and he winces.
Bingo shifts. Bandit hums a few more bars of Silent Night. He tiptoes to the door.
Bingo: "Dad?"
He turns around. Bingo is sitting up.
Bandit: (quietly) "Yes, mate?"
Bingo: "Are fish kind?"
Bandit: "Uh, yeah, I— I think so…"
Bingo: "Oh, okay. Night-night!"
Bingo lies down and turns over.
Bandit makes eye contact with the camera.
The theme to Shaun plays as Bluey dances on the end slate.
