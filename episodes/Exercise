The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler's house. It then transitions to the main bath, where Bandit is applying toothpaste to his toothbrush.
Bandit: (imitating an electric guitar riff) Neow neow neow, neow neow neow neow.
Bandit starts brushing his teeth, and then steps on a digital scale. It beeps.
Bandit: Oh, man.
Bluey pops out of the bathtub.
Bluey: What?
Bandit: Ah! Bluey!
Bandit walks back over to the sink.
Bluey: Why did you say "Oh, man"?
Bandit spits and puts away his toothbrush.
Bandit: (sighs) Ugh, I just need to do some exercise.
Chilli and Bingo enter the bathroom.
Chilli: Tell me about it.
Bluey: Whoa!
Bluey ducks back into the tub. Bandit examines his love handles in the mirror. Off screen, we hear Chilli start running the shower.
Bingo: (singing) Doo-doo doo-doo doo-doo doo.
Bingo walks up behind Bandit. Bandit sighs, and pinches a roll of belly fat. Bingo picks up a rubber ducky and throws it into the tub.
Bluey: (offscreen) Ow!
Bingo: (giggles) Found you!
Bluey pops back up.
Bluey: Why don't you just do some exercise?
Bandit attempts to look at his backside in the mirror. Bingo starts to rearrange the foam letters on the side of the tub.
Bandit: Same old reason, Bluey: you kids and work.
Bingo: Us?
Bluey: Why don't you do it now?
Bandit examines his front in the mirror.
Bandit: 'Cause I'd be late for work.
Bluey: So?
Bandit: Well, that wouldn't make my boss very happy.
Bingo: How do you make your boss very happy?
Bandit: By not being late for work.
The episode's background music begins to play.
Bluey: Well, we won't get in the way of your exercise, and I think your boss would want you to be very happy as well.
Bandit: Yeah, maybe you're right, Bluey.
The background music pauses for a moment as the scales beep. The camera cuts back to show Chilli standing on them. The wider shot also reveals that Bingo has arranged the foam letters into a smiley face.
Chilli: Oh, man.
Removed content ends here. On current and Disney+ prints, the episode starts here.
The scene cuts to a brief shot of the top of the poinciana tree and sky, then to the back yard. Bandit is laying out a green towel on the grass. He has a pair of dumbbells on the lawn, and has set up his phone on a speaker dock on the bench.
Bandit: Hey, Phoney, play exercise playlist.
Dance music begins to play. Bandit taps his exercise tracker band a few times.
Bandit: Okay. Ten minutes 'til I got to go to work. Let's get some exercise.
Bandit turns around.
Bandit: Huh?
The camera pulls back. Bingo is sitting in between the dumbbells and pantomiming driving; so that the weights represent tires.
Bingo: (imitating engine) Vroom! Vroom!
Bandit: Oh, man.
Bingo: (imitating horn) Beep, beep!
Bandit: Bingo, I need those.
Bingo: But I'm on my way to work.
Bandit: Can't you catch the bus?
Bingo: I want to get there early. I'm starting a new job.
Bandit: Uh, righto. I'll do some sit-ups.
Bandit turns around. The camera pulls back to show Bluey using the towel as a blanket.
Bandit: What the—
Bluey pantomimes waking up, yawning, and then checking her watch.
Bluey: (yawns) Oop, late for work.
Bandit: (sighs)
TITLE CARD - Exercise
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Exercise.
Bluey "makes her bed," putting the towel back where it was, then runs in a loop behind the tree. Bingo continues making car noises.
Bandit: Okay. I can make this work.
Bingo pantomimes parking the car and gets out.
Bingo: (imitating brakes) Errt! (imitating car door) Clink! (imitating remote lock) Woop-woop.
Bluey approaches from behind.
Bluey: Hey, hey, hold the door!
Bingo pantomimes holding the door for her. Bluey walks through, onto the towel.
Bingo: Oh, yes. There you go.
Bluey: Thanks. Ooh, I haven't seen you around? Are you new?
Bingo: Yes. This is my first day.
Bluey: Oh, well, I could show you around, if you like. I've worked here for ages.
Bingo: Oh, thanks.
Bluey: It's a pretty boring job.
The camera pulls back. Bandit is doing squats.
Bluey: This is the lift. You push this button...
She pokes Bandit's stomach.
Bluey: (imitating button) Doot!
Bandit squats down, and makes a platform with his hands. Bluey steps on.
Bluey: So then push what floor you want.
Bluey mimes pushing a button.
Bluey: (imitating button) Doot!
Bandit stands halfway.
Bandit: (groans)
Bingo: (giggles)
Bluey: This floor's just some, um, people and stuff. The top floor's the best. (imitating button) Doot!
Bandit stands all the way up.
Bandit: (groans)
Bluey: Hi!
Bingo: (giggles)
Bluey: (imitating button) Doot!
Bandit squats down, returning Bluey to ground level.
Bingo: Can I try?
Bluey steps onto Bandit's right hand, and Bingo steps onto his left.
Bluey: Yeah, but the lift's a bit slow with two people. It's very old.
Bandit rolls his eyes. Bingo pantomimes pressing a button.
Bingo: (imitating button) Bwoot! Top floor!
Bandit stands up. He continues straining and groaning as the girls talk.
Bandit: (groans)
Bluey: Hi, everyone. This is...
Bingo: Larn.
Bluey: She's new. I'm showing her ar—
Bandit loses balance, and all three fall forwards.
Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo: Aaaaaah!
Bluey and Bingo: (giggling)
Bluey: Let's take the stairs.
The scene cuts to a close up of Bandit's phone. The album art and background music change. The scene pulls back slightly. Bandit's arms enter and leave the frame as he does floor presses with the dumbbells; his body is not visible. Bluey and Bingo enter the frame.
Bandit: (grunting)
Bluey: So, this is your chair.
Bingo: Ooh!
Bandit raises his arms without the dumbbells, hands spread to form a seat.
Bluey: Hop on. I'll show you how it works. You push this lever, and...
Bingo pantomimes pushing the lever on a pneumatic office chair. Bandit lowers her with a jerky motino.
Bandit: (imitating pneumatic cylinder) Pssh!
Bingo: (shrieking) Aah! (giggles)
Bluey: ... it goes lower, and you push it again for higher.
Bingo pantomimes pulling on the lever. Bandit raises her all the way.
Bandit: (imitating pneumatic cylinder) Pssh!
Bingo: Whee!
Bingo operates the lever over and over, while giggling. Bandit continues to raise and lower her.
Bandit: (imitating pneumatic cylinder) Pssh! Pssh! Pssh! Pssh! Pssh! Pssh!
Bingo ends in the upper position.
Bluey: and when I get bored, I...
Bluey pantomimes giving the office chair a big spin.
Bluey: ...spin!
Bandit spins Bingo around.
Bingo: Whee! (giggles)
Bandit: Whoa, whoa!
Bandit stops spinning Bingo. She wobbles back and forth dizzily.
Bluey: Come on. I'll show you to the cafeteria.
Bingo falls forward off the seat.
Bingo: Ah! Oof.
The scene cuts to the phone again; the album art and music has changed. It cuts back to Bandit, who is doing jumping jacks.
Bandit: .. ten, eleven, twelve ...
Bandit continues counting as Bingo and Bluey walk up to him.
Bluey: So this is the cafeteria. Do you want a sushi roll?
Bingo: Well, I really think I should be getting to wo—
Bluey: One sushi roll, please.
Bandit grabs Bingo.
Bandit: Yah!
Bingo: (squeals)
Bandit puts Bingo down on the towel and rolls her up in it.
Bingo: (giggles)
Bandit: (grunts) Yah!
Bandit picks up the Bingo roll and carries her over to Bluey.
Bandit: You want soy sauce?
Bluey: Yes, please!
Bingo: No!
Bandit pantomimes dipping Bingo's head in soy sauce.
Bandit: Dip, and dip.
Bingo: (giggles)
Bandit: Here you go!
Bluey: Oof!
Bingo: (giggling)
Bandit hands the Bingo roll to Bluey, who immediately falls over backwards.
The scene cuts to a garden gnome, who is wearing a weight belt and lifting a barbell over its head. Its facial expression might be meant to convey great effort, but it also looks as if its about to vomit. The scene cuts back to Bandit, who is doing sit ups, with Bingo standing on his right foot and Bluey on his left.
Bandit: (alternately grunting and exhaling)
Bingo: Well, thanks for showing me around. I'm going to start work now.
Bluey: Hang on. You haven't seen the ping-pong table.
Bingo: Uh, I think I'm meant to be doing my job. What if the boss catches me?
Bluey: Don't worry. The boss loves ping-pong. C'mon!
Bluey grabs Bingo's hand, and the two run off. Bandit, losing his counterweights mid sit-up, falls backwards.
Bandit: Hey!
The scene cuts to the yard. The hose divides the yard in half, with Bingo on the left and Bluey on the right. They both have ping-pong paddles, and Bandit is standing in front of Bluey.
Bluey: Ready?
Bingo: Ready!
Bluey serves, and Bandit starts running.
Bluey: Bwut!
Bandit: (panting)
Bingo returns him.
Bingo: Poit!
Bluey returns.
Bluey: Bwut!
The camera cuts to an overhead shot as Bingo returns. Bluey is on the opposite side of the court from where she needs to be.
Bingo: Poit!
Bandit: Bluey, get there, get there!
Bluey trots over, clearly not making an effort. Bandit sails by her.
Bandit: Argh!
Bandit crashes head first into the hedge. Only his bum is still visible.
Bandit: Oof!
Bluey: Whoa. Good shot!
Bandit: (groans).
The scene cuts back to the towel. Bandit walks in from screen right, tired and mussed with leaves in his fur. He collapses on the towel.
Bandit: (groans) Agh. Ugh.
The camera cuts back to the "office" position, and Bandit's hands form the chair. Bingo climbs up and sits down.
Bingo: Well, thanks for that. I'd best get to my job now.
Bluey: Oh, yes, of course. I probably should do some work, too. See you around.
Bluey waves and exits. Bingo pulls the lever, and Bandit raises her up.
Bandit: (imitating pneumatic cylinder) Pssh-gung.
Bingo puts her hands out, pantomiming a keyboard.
Bingo: Wait, what is my job?
Bluey: (offscreen) Psst!
Bingo: Huh?
The scene cuts to a wider shot. Bluey is hiding behind Bandit's head.
Bluey: Psst! (whispering) Hey, down here!
Bingo: What are you doing?
Bluey: (whispering) I'm sneaking off to the fun park! Come on!
Bingo: What?
Bluey: (whispering) Just a quick go on the roller-coaster.
Bingo: What if the boss sees us?
Bandit's arms begin to tremble.
Bluey: (whispering) Look, your boss just wants you to be happy, okay?
Bandit grimaces with the effort of holding up Bingo.
Bingo: Okay.
Bingo jumps down, and both girls run offscreen. Bandit relaxes his arms.
Bandit: (sighs) Ah! Thank goodness.
Bluey and Bingo go into the playroom, then immediately come back out.
Bluey: Here we are at the fun park!
Bandit: Oh, what?!
The scene cuts to show Bandit throwing Bluey up into the air.
Bandit: (grunts)
Bluey: (squeals)
Bandit: (grunts)
Bluey: (squeals)
The scene cuts to show Bandit swinging Bluey in circles by her right arm and left foot.
Bandit: Whoooaaa!
Bluey: (giggles)
The scene cuts; showing the same scene from Bandits perspective. It cuts again, showing Bandit swinging Bingo around by the shoulders; still from his perspective.
Bingo: (squeals) (giggles)
The scene cuts. Bandit is running through the yard, holding Bluey sideways and waving her up and down.
Bandit: (grunts)
Bluey: (giggles)
Bandit takes her through a hairpin turn.
Bluey: Whoo!
The scene cuts. Bandit is holding Bingo on the ground, he lifts her quickly over his head.
Bingo: Yeah! (giggles)
The scene cuts. We see a camera's view of Bluey taking a selfie. She's hugging Bingo, who is making a peace sign. Bandit is panting in the background. The camera clicks, and the scene freezes into a photo.
The scene cuts to an empty bit of yard. Bingo walks into frame carrying Greydancer. Bluey follows, holding Polly Puppy.
Bingo: That was so much fun.
Bluey: I told you.
Bingo pantomimes looking at a watch.
Bingo: Oh, my goodness! It's 14 o'clock! We have to get back to work!
They drop the stuffed animals and run off.
The scene cuts back to Bandit, standing on the towel. He's stretching his lower back. Bluey and Bingo walk in, and he squats down to form the elevator.
Bingo: I can't see the boss.
Bluey: Me neither!
Bluey and Bingo take their places in Bandit's hands.
Bingo: (imitating button) Poit!
Bandit struggles to lift the girls.
Bandit: (groans)
Bingo: Thanks so much for showing me 'round.
Bluey: No problems.
Bandit: (groans and strains)
Bingo: Sorry I didn't go to the fun park straight away. I just want to do this job really good and make my boss happy.
Bluey: You DID make your boss happy.
Bingo: Huh?
Bluey: I'm your boss!
Bingo: What?! Really?
Bandit: (groans and strains)
Bluey: Yeah, and I'm happy! Are you happy?
Bingo: I'm REALLY happy!
Bluey: Great. Then we're both happy.
Bingo: Why didn't you tell me before?
Bandit: (groans loudly)
Bluey: Well, the answer to that is long, so here it is. When I started this company, I—
Bandit: Argh!
Bandit falls down, the girls falling on top of him.
Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo: Oof!
Bandit: (groaning) Augh.
Bluey: I really should get this lift fixed.
Bandit's fitness tracker beeps.
Bandit: (sighing) Whew. Time for a warm-down.
Bandit starts stretching his leg. Bluey and Bingo get back up.
Bingo: I have another question. What actually is my job?
Bluey: Oh, that's easy. You just hold this.
Bluey holds up Bandit's leg.
Bingo: Oh.
Bingo takes over holding up Bandit's leg.
Bluey: I told you it was boring.
Bingo: Hee-hee!
Bluey: You're doing a great job, though.
Bingo: Thanks. You really are the happiest boss ever.
Chilli enters from the patio, holding a sport water bottle.
Chilli: (clears throat) Hi, boss. Um, I'm back with your cup of tea.
Bluey takes a swig from the water bottle, then spits it out. She throws the water bottle on the ground.
Bluey: (yelling with a deep voice) I said I wanted ELEVEN sugars!
Chilli: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Bluey: (yelling with a deep voice) I'm not happy! Larn, new job.
Bandit takes off the fitness tracker and tosses it to Chilli.
Bluey: (yelling with a deep voice) Tickle her!
Bingo salutes. Chilli slips on the fitness tracker and runs off, pursued by Bingo.
Chilli: (squeals) (yelling) I'm sorry!
Chilli and Bingo run back and forth around the yard.
Bingo: (giggles)
Chilli: (yelling) I promise I'll do a better job next time!
Bandit gets up and walks onto the patio, ruffling Bluey's hair as he passes.
Bluey: You try and be a happy boss, but then this sort of thing happens.
Bingo: (giggling)
Chilli: (laughing)
Bandit continues on into the house. Bingo and Chilli run around the yard as Bluey watches, hands on hips.
The camera pans up into the sky, which fades into a doctor's office. Bandit has his arm in a blood pressure cuff, which is being read by a doctor. Bluey and Bingo play with blocks on the floor.
Doctor: Huh, 120 over 80. Excellent. 
The doctor takes off the cuff and turns to his computer.
Doctor: Got to say, Bandit, you're in great shape. Have you been going to the gym?
Bandit ruffles Bluey's hair.
Bandit: Nah, it's been coming to me.
The credits song is the most energetic arrangement of the episode music, that plays during the fun park and Chilli chase scenes. Instead of Bluey dancing, we see Bandit doing sit-ups. His feet are weighted down with the dumbbells, with Greydancer and Polly Puppy sitting on top of them.
