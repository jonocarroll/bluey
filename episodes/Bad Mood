The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heelers' house in daytime.
In the sun-room, Bingo hides behind the wicker chair, holding a biscuit. She giggles.
Bingo: (singsong) "I'm going to eat you."
Someone taps on the window.
Chilli: "Bingo."
The camera pulls back - Chilli is right outside the window, on top of a ladder. She's been cleaning the windows.
Bingo: "Aah!"
Chilli resumes cleaning the window with a squeegee.
Chilli: "I didn't say you could have a biscuit. Put it back."
Bingo: "Sorry."
Bingo giggles.
Chilli: "You're being a bit of a cheeky kid today."
Bingo: "I'm not a cheeky kid."
Chilli: "I know. You're a good kid."
Bingo: "But you just called me cheeky."
Chilli: "No, I said you're being cheeky. There's a difference."
Bingo: (upset) "No, there isn't."
Bingo slumps and walks away.
Chilli: "Oh, Bingo."
In the kids' bedroom, Bingo lies down and sulks on the watermelon rug.
Bingo: "I'm in a bad mood. Nothing's going to cheer me up. Nothing at all."
Bingo spots a horned helmet under Bluey's bed. She gasps and brightens up.
In the kitchen, Bandit opens the dishwasher. He examines a glass.
Bandit: "They're still dirty?!"
Bingo runs up behind him, holding the helmet.
Bingo: "Dad!"
Bandit: "Oh, hi, Bingo—"
He spots the helmet.
Bandit: "Aw, no, not Bad Mood."
Bingo laughs.
TITLE CARD: Bad Mood
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called: Bad Mood."
In the playroom, Bluey puts the finishing touches on a tower of blocks.
Bandit stomps in, glowering. He's wearing the helmet, and he's "controlling Bingo" by holding her hands in his hands, while she stands on his feet.
Bluey: "Hey, Bingo, check out my tower."
Bandit makes wordless, angry noises as Bad Mood Bingo leaves a trail of destruction. First, they knock over Bluey's tower.
Bandit: "Uuooh!"
Then, they grab a teddy bear and swing it, knocking Bluey down too.
Bandit: "Eeaah!"
Bluey and Bingo both laugh.
Bluey: "Bingo, what are you doing?"
Bad Mood Bingo punts the teddy bear out the door, into the bushes outside.
Bandit: "Hup! Umph!"
Bingo: (laughing) "I can't help it."
Bandit starts stomping towards the back yard, kicking over the last few blocks standing as he does.
Bandit: "Umph!"
Bingo: (laughing) "I'm in a bad mood."
In the side yard, Chilli is hanging linens on the clothesline. Bad Mood Bingo stomps up to her.
Chilli: "Oh, hi, Bingo."
Bad Mood Bingo kicks over the washing basket, scattering linens on the lawn.
Bandit: "Waauauagh!"
They tear a sheet off the line and toss it over Chilli's head.
Bandit: "Waauagh!"
Chilli: "Aah!"
Bad Mood Bingo stomps over to the other side of the washing line while Bingo laughs. Chilli peeks out from under the sheet. She seems amused.
Chilli: "Bingo, what's gotten into you?"
Bingo: (laughing) "It's not me."
Bluey runs up to them.
Bluey: "Mum, Bingo knocked down my tower."
Bad Mood Bingo picks up a pair of jocks and throws them in Bluey's face.
Bandit: "Uaaaah!"
Bluey: "Aah!"
She hastily pulls it off her face.
Bluey: "Dad's stinky jock!"
Chilli: "This isn't like you, Bingo."
Bad Mood Bingo starts stomping on a mushroom, over and over.
Bingo: (laughing) "It's not my fault."
Bluey: "Wait, I know what's going on."
Chilli: "What?"
Bluey: "Bingo's in a bad mood."
Chilli: "Oh, yeah. Well, we have to help her get out of it."
Bluey: "How do we do that?"
Chilli: "I'm not sure, but you have to think of something, Bluey."
Bad Mood Bingo is swinging a sock around. She throws it.
Bandit: "Uaghagh!"
Chilli: "She's tearing the place apart!"
Bluey: "Okay, let's do this, Bingo."
Bad Mood Bingo is gone.
Bluey: "Bingo?"
In the living room, Bad Mood Bingo is laying down on the couch. They turn on the television. It's showing the cricket game. Bluey runs in from the sun-room.
Bluey: "Aah! Bingo, Mum didn't say you could watch TV."
Bingo: (laughing) "It's not me, it's my bad mood. I don't even like cricket.
Bluey: "I'll take that."
Bluey confiscates the remote control. Bad Mood Bingo stands up and throws a couch cushion on the ground.
Bandit: "Uaaagh! Ugh!"
Bluey and Bingo laugh as Bad Mood Bingo stomps out of the room.
Bluey: "Hey, Bingo, come back."
In the kitchen, Bad Mood Bingo opens the fridge. Bingo spots a bar of chocolate.
Bingo: "Ooh."
Bad Mood Bingo takes it and closes the fridge. Bingo tries to take a bite, and then again - but Bandit keeps moving it out of biting range.
Bluey: "Bingo, you're eating treat food."
Bingo: "It's not me. My bad mood is making me eat chocolate."
Bluey snatches the chocolate. Bingo and Bandit gasp.
Bluey: "Stop it. You'll get a tummy ache."
Bad Mood Bingo stomps their feet in frustration. Bingo laughs.
Bandit: "Grrrrr!"
Bad Mood Bandit swats at the fridge, knocking a handful of magnets to the floor.
Bandit: "Ugh!"
They stomp out of the room. Bingo laughs as they go.
Bluey: "Ugh. Come on, Bluey, think. What gets me out of a bad mood? Ooh, I know."
In the office, Bad Mood Bingo is repeatedly kicking the yoga ball against the chest. Bluey enters, pushing Bingo's relaxer chair.
Bluey: (sing-song) "Yoo-hoo, Bad Mood Bingo."
Bad Mood Bingo stops to look at her.
Bluey: "Fancy a little sit in your relaxer chair?"
Bad Mood Bingo gives the yoga ball a big kick, sending it out of frame.
Bandit: "Oogh!"
Bad Mood Bingo stomps over and sits down in the chair (with Bandit sitting cross-legged behind it.
Bluey: "Now, how about we close our eyes and take some relaxing belly breaths?"
She closes her eyes and holds her arms out to the side.
Bluey: "Deep breath in."
Bluey moves her arms in a circular motion to her stomach. Bandit makes Bingo scratch her head. She giggles.
Bluey: "All the way to your belly—stop fidgeting, honey. And out."
She moves her arms back to her sides.
Bluey: "Isn't that relaxing?"
Bad Mood Bingo is wiggling the door back and forth, making the hinges creak.
Bluey: "Best not to creak the door, honey."
They keep going.
Bluey: "Sweetheart—"
Bad Mood Bingo leaps to their feet, knocks over the relaxer chair, and stomps out of the room. Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bluey: "Well, that didn't work."
In the playroom, Bad Mood Bingo is stomping on an echidna toy. It squeaks with each stomp, like a chew toy.
Bandit: "Unh! Unh! Umph! Urr!"
Bluey: "Hey, Bingo, maybe you'd like to draw some lovely pictures?"
She gestures to a low table with paper and crayons. Bad Mood Bingo walks closer.
Bluey: "That always helps me when I'm in a bad mood."
Bluey puts the finishing touches on a drawing of a purple unicorn.
Bluey: "Look at this happy unicorn."
Bluey slides the drawing over to Bad Mood Bingo.
Bluey: "Perhaps you'd like to add something lovely to it."
Bad Mood Bingo grabs a brown crayon and quickly scribbles on the drawing. He's given the unicorn an angry face, and drawn a big pile of unicorn poo, complete with flies. Bingo laughs.
Bluey: (taken aback) "Oh, goodness. Well, that's... lovely."
Bad Mood Bingo balls up the drawing and throws it over Bluey's head. She ducks.
Bingo: (laughing) "I'm sorry, Bluey."
Bluey laughs.
In the hall toilet, Bad Mood Bingo is angrily unrolling the toilet paper.
Bandit: "Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh!"
As they finish off the roll of toilet paper, Bluey sets a boom box down in the hall.
Bluey: (sing-song) "Oh, Bingo."
She presses a button on the jukebox. Lollipop Yum Yum Yum begins to play. It's saccharine, repetitive, and features heavily pitch-shifted vocals.
Singer: ♫ "Lollipop, lollipop, yum yum yum!" ♫
Bluey: "What's this, your favourite song?"
Singer: ♫ "Lollipop, lollipop, yum yum yum!" ♫
Bluey: "Doesn't it make you want to dance?"
Bad Mood Bingo hits the button, stopping the music. Bingo laughs.
Bandit: "Hmph."
Bluey slides the speaker away.
Bluey: "Hey."
She presses the button again, and the music starts.
Singer: ♫ "Lollipop, lollipop, yum yum yum!" ♫
Bluey starts dancing.
Bluey: "Dance with me, Bingo. You love this song."
Singer: ♫ "Lollipop, lollipop, yum yum yum!" ♫
Bingo laughs. She struggles against Bandit's grip on her arms.
Bingo: (laughing) "I want to dance, but something's stopping me."
Bluey continue dancing.
Bluey: "No one can stay in a bad mood while this song is on."
Singer: ♫ "Lollipop, lollipop, yum yum yum!" ♫
Bandit shakes his head.
Bandit: "Uooghoohoo!"
Singer: ♫ "Lollipop, lollipop, yum yum yum!" ♫
Bandit: "Urghrararara!"
Bluey: "Maybe it just needs to be louder."
She cranks up the volume. Bingo laughs.
Bandit: "Ruuugh!"
Bandit, clutches the sides of his head.
Bluey: "Bingo, you're free. Run!"
Bandit: "Rughrururuh!"
Singer: ♫ "Lollipop, lollipop, yum yum yum!" ♫
Bluey and Bingo run down the hall.
Bluey: "Quick, we have to get away before your bad mood comes back."
Bluey runs into the bathroom, and hides in the shower stall.
Bluey: "Let's hide in here, Bingo."
She looks over the shower stall railing.
Bluey: "Bingo?"
Back in the hallway, Bandit is stomping along after them. Bingo runs up to him. Their eyes meet, and then Bingo narrows her eyes mischievously. She voluntarily climbs back into the Bad Mood's control. She laughs.
Bluey peeks around the bathroom door frame.
Bluey: "Bingo?"
She steps out into the hall.
Bluey: "Bingo, where are you?"
Bingo's doll Poppy hits Bluey in the back of the head with a squeak.
Bluey: "Aah!"
She turns around, seeing Bad Mood Bingo.
Bluey: "What? Bingo, you're back in your bad mood."
Bingo: (laughing) "Yeah!"
Bluey: "But I got you out of it. Why'd you get back in?"
Bingo: "Um..."
Bandit sticks Bingo's finger up her nose, then holds it out, threatening Bluey. Bingo laughs.
Bluey: "Boogers!"
Bluey runs away, and Bad Mood Bingo runs after her.
Back in the side yard, Chilli is hanging the linens back up. Bluey leaps over the laundry basket and then takes cover behind it.
Bluey: "Mum, I got Bingo out of her bad mood!"
Chilli: "Well done."
Bluey: "But she just went back in it."
Chilli: "What?!"
Bluey: "Then she chased me with her boogers."
Chilli: "Ohhh, I've seen this before. She must like being in a bad mood."
Bluey: "Why would anyone like being in a bad mood?"
Chilli: "I dunno."
In a cutaway to Bandit and Chilli's bedroom, Bad Mood Bingo is jumping on the bed while attempting to smash an inflatable electric guitar on it.
Chilli: "So what are we meant to do?"
Bluey: "Ooh, that's tricky. Um... Oh, I got an idea."
She whispers a plan to Chilli.
In the playroom, Bad Mood Bingo has teed up the echidna toy on a construction block. They swing a toy rolling pin like a golf club. It squeaks as it sails off into the distance.
Bluey: "Oh, wow, this is the best house I've ever made."
Bad Mood Bingo spots Bluey, admiring a house made out of sculpting clay. It's resting on a suspiciously lumpy object, covered in a sheet.
Bluey: "Oh, I'm so happy with it. I hope it lasts forever."
The Bad Mood, enraged, shakes Bingo back and forth. She laughs.
Bandit: "Raaaagh, Ooough!"
Bad Mood Bingo charges Bluey with the rolling pin.
Bingo: "No, bad mood."
Bluey: "Oh, I might just wander over here now."
Bluey walks behind the sheet-covered object. Bad Mood Bingo runs up, and takes a swing with the rolling pin, which misses.
Bandit: "Errrr oough!"
The sheet-covered object moved out of the way. As the sheet falls away, it's revealed to be the pedal car.
Bandit: "Huh?"
Bluey taunts them as she drives around the yard.
Bluey: "If you want to squash my house, you gotta catch it first!"
Bad Mood Bingo stomps their feet in frustration. Bingo laughs. They take off running after Bingo.
Bandit: "Arrrrrgh!"
Bluey laughs as Bad Mood Bingo comes up behind her. Bandit is already panting. He rapidly loses ground, wheezing.
Bluey: "Haha! Bad moods hate running around."
Exhausted, Bandit give sup on the chase and lays down on the ground. Bingo laughs.
Bandit: "Uuuuuugh."
Bluey: "Come on, Bingo!"
She tries to pull him away. Bandit loses his grip, but Bingo holds on to his hand.
Bingo: "No, I want to stay with my bad mood."
Bluey pulls on Bingo, as Bandit and Bingo struggle to maintain their grip.
Bluey & Bandit: "Hrrrgh!"
Bluey wins the tug of war. She squeals as she stumbles backwards.
Bluey: "Aah!"
Bluey carries Bingo over to the paulownia tree. Bingo is still reaching out for the Bad Mood.
Bluey: "Mum, I got her out!"
Chilli comes running up. She's wearing a sun hat with a floral decoration. She holds out her arms.
Chilli: "Give her here."
Chilli takes control of Bingo, holding her arms like Bandit was earlier.
Bingo: "Hmm?"
Chilli: "Whaddaya reckon, Bingo? Now you're in a good mood."
Chilli makes Bingo jump for joy.
Chilli: "Cuddle."
Good Mood Bingo hugs Bluey.
Bluey: "Aww."
Bingo giggles.
Chilli: "Cuddle."
Good Mood Bingo hugs the paulownia tree. Bingo laughs.
Chilli: "Cuddle."
Good Mood Bingo hugs Hecuba, the garden gnome. Bingo laughs.
Chilli: "Cuddle."
Good Mood Bingo hugs the pedal car. Bingo laughs.
Bingo: "Maybe I should give my bad mood a cuddle."
Bandit is curled up on the ground, hugging his knees.
Bandit: (sadly) "Aoooh."
Bluey: "No way. He's bad."
Bingo: "No, he isn't."
Bingo, by herself, walks up to Bandit. She climbs onto him.
Bingo: "He was just behaving bad."
She gives him a big hug."
Bingo: "Mmmm."
Bandit: "Mmm."
Bandit smiles, and Bingo's tail wags. The horned helmet falls off.
A more abrasive arrangement of Lollipop Yum Yum Yum plays over the end credits as Bluey dances. The singer has a hoarse burr to their voice, and meows over previously instrumental portions of the song.
Singer: ♫ "Lollipop, lollipop, yum yum yum!" ♫
Singer: ♫ "Lollipop, lollipop, yum yum yum!" ♫
Singer: ♫ "yum yum yum, nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya!" ♫
Singer: ♫ "yum-yum yum yum, nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya!" ♫
Singer: ♫ "Lollipop, lollipop, yum yum yum!" ♫
