The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heelers' house in the morning. It cuts to the kitchen, where Bandit is preparing breakfast. Bingo reads a book, wearing a pair of headphones. Bluey sings shrilly.
Bluey: *in operatically voice* ♫ "OH! WHERE IS MY TOAST?!" ♫
Bandit winces.
Bandit: "Bluey! Can you be as quiet as Bingo for a bit?"
Bluey: ♫ "NO! I CAN'T!" ♫
Chilli walks in, holding a receipt.
Chilli: "Bluey, I can't find your library books, and they're due back."
Chilli looks through a tote bag of books and a stack of books on the counter.
Chilli: "Have you seen ‘Shmyrtle, The Dirty Turtle’?"
Bluey: ♫ "NO! I HAVE NOT SEEN ‘SHMYRTLE, THE DIRTY TURTLE’!" ♫
Chilli: "You have to keep better track of your things."
She tidies the stack of books on the counter, then starts going through a backpack.
Bluey: ♫ "WHAT ABOUT BINGO?!" ♫
Chilli: "Bingo put hers in a neat pile when she's read them."
Bingo puts her book on top of the pile, then takes off her headphones and lays them on top.
Bingo: "Finished."
Bandit: "Bing! Orders up!"
Bandit serves the breakfast he's been preparing - cheese and jam on toast, cut into triangles.
Bluey: *in normal voice* "Ooh! Cheese and jam!"
Bluey takes a couple of big bites and chews happily.
Bluey: "Mnam mnam."
Bingo: "Dad, I don't like cheese and jam."
Bandit: "What? I thought you did."
Bingo: "No, Bluey does. I like banana and peanut butter."
Bluey: "Bleugh."
Bluey jams the rest of her toast triangle in her mouth. Bandit puts Bingo's toast on Bluey's plate, and starts another piece of toast for Bingo.
Bandit: "How can you two come from the same parents, be raised in the same house, but be completely different?"
Bluey and Bingo look at each other for a moment.
Bluey, Bingo: "Don't know."
Bandit starts peeling a banana.
Bandit: "Well, I'll tell you this for free: my life would be a lot easier if you were both the same."
The camera pulls back, showing that Chilli is now going through some books scattered under the dining table.
Chilli: "Tell me about it."
Bluey: "Bingo! I've got an idea!"
Bingo: "Okay!"
Bluey and Bingo run off, giggling.
Bandit: "Wait, what? Hang on."
Bandit sighs deeply.
Chilli: "Why do you keep setting them up?"
In the play room, Bluey digs through a basket of dress-up props.
Bingo: "What are you looking for?"
Bluey pulls out a palette of hair chalk. She gasps.
Bluey: "Hair chalk!"
Bingo: "Ooh!"
Bluey: "Give me your arm."
Bingo holds out her arm. Bluey swipes a hair chalk down it, leaving a stripe of blue. They both giggle.
Bluey: "This is gonna be great!"
Back in the kitchen, Bandit has just finished the peanut butter banana toast.
Bandit: "Alright, done."
Off camera, running footsteps and then a squeaking chair can be heard. Bandit turns to serve Bingo.
Bandit: "Here you go, Bingo: peanut butter and banan—Agh!"
Bandit pulls back. The camera shows what what he sees - two Blueys. Bingo has been coloured with a close copy of Bluey's marking. Bluey and Bingo giggle. Bingo looks at the peanut butter banana toast.
Bingo: "Bleugh."
TITLE CARD - Mini Bluey
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Mini Bluey."
In the kitchen, Chilli coos over Bingo.
Chilli: "Aww! So cute!"
Bluey: "Let me introduce you to us. I'm Bluey, and this is Mini Bluey."
Bingo: "Hi."
Bluey: "She's just like me. Watch."
Bluey hands her a slice of jam and cheese toast. Bingo's face falls.
Bluey: "Have some cheese and jam, Mini Bluey."
Bluey picks up a slice of toast for herself.
Bluey: "We love cheese and jam."
They both take a bite. Bingo makes a pained face.
Bingo: (strained) "I...love...it."
Bluey: "See?"
Bandit: (muttering) "This is gonna be a long day."
Bluey marches into the living room, followed by Bingo.
Bluey: "Okay, Mini Bluey, let's learn about me. Hmm... Ooh. I like to say 'cereal' instead of 'serious.'"
Bingo nods.
Bluey: "Oh, and I'll show you how I dance. I like to do this sort of thing."
She bobs from side to side, pumping her arms. Bingo copies her.
Bluey: "And sometimes this."
She shakes out her right foot, and then her left. Bingo copies her and giggles.
Bluey: "Yep, that's it. And I sort of just talk all the time. It doesn't even need to make sense. Just noises are fine."
Bluey starts making a high-pitched noise...
Bluey: "Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp!"
...and Bingo joins in.
Bluey, Bingo: "Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp!"
Bluey: "and I like to sing."
She sings shrilly and dramatically.
Bluey: ♫ "Ohh! Singing things!" ♫
Bingo giggles, then tries it herself.
Bingo: ♫ "Ohh! Singing things..." ♫
Bluey: "A bit louder."
Bingo: ♫ "Ohh! Singing things!" ♫
Bluey: "Yeah, that's great."
In the playroom, Bluey leads Bingo around.
Bluey: I like to just leave my toys on the ground."
Bluey picks up a squeaky blue echidna and pets it.
Bingo: "Isn't it better to tidy them away?"
Bluey: "Nah, it doesn't make much difference."
Bluey tosses the echidna on the ground in front of Bingo. Bingo trips over it.
Bingo: "Agh!"
Chilli looks through a stack of books that's being used as the support in a blanket fort.
Chilli: "Where is it?!"
Bluey walks up behind her, tailed by Bingo.
Bluey: "Bort! Bort! Bort! I like to ask a lot of questions."
She turns to Chilli.
Bluey: "Mum, what are you doing?"
Chilli: "You know what I'm doing, Bluey, I'm—"
Bluey: "But I don't really listen to the whole answer."
Chilli gets down on her hands and knees to look at the bottom books in the stack.
Bluey: "Ooh, and if I see a bum, I give it a little bom-di-di-bom."
Bluey plays Chilli's bum like the bongos. Bingo giggles and runs to join in. Chilli tries to wave them away.
Chilli: "Hey! Get out of it!"
Bluey: "Bom-di-di-bom di di, boop-boop-boop."
Out in the yard, Bandit is raking grass clipping into a pile.
Bandit: "Hey, Blueys, I need you to pick up these grass clippings...
Bluey and Bingo run out onto the porch.
Bandit: "...and put them in the wheelbarrow."
Bingo: "Yes, Father."
Bingo starts to go out and help. Bluey stops her.
Bluey: "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where do you think you're going?"
Bingo: "To help Dad. I like wheelbarrows."
Bluey: "Bingo likes wheelbarrows. Bingo helps Dad. You're Mini Bluey now."
Bingo: "Oh, yeah."
Bluey: "And Bluey does not like grass clippings. I'll tell you that for free."
Bingo: "But Dad said we have to do it."
Bluey: "Let's find out if he's cereal."
Bluey clears her throat.
Bluey: "Excuse me, big fella."
Bandit: (muttering) "Here we go."
Bingo: "These grass clippings you're talking about, why do we have to put them in the wheelbarrow? They don't belong to us."
Bandit: "Well, you know all that food in the fridge? That doesn't belong to you either. But, if you want to keep eating it, I suggest you get to work."
Bluey: "Okay, he's cereal."
A few moments later, Bluey and Bingo are loading the wheelbarrow, while Bandit waters the lawn.
Bingo: ♫ "Wh-ee-ee-ee-l!" ♫
Bingo dumps in an armful of grass. Bluey put sin a single blade.
Bingo: ♫ "Barrow!" ♫
Bandit: "Mini Bluey, that's quite loud."
Bluey: "Yeah, Mini Bluey, I don't really sing when I'm doing chores."
Bingo puts in another armload of grass.
Bluey: "I usually whinge..."
Bingo puts in another armload of grass.
Bluey: "...annnd do the job a lot slower than what you're doing. Watch."
Bluey slumps, listless. She moans loudly.
Bluey: "Ughhh. Why do we have to do this?"
Bingo giggles. Bluey deposits a pinch of grass in the wheelbarrow.
Bingo: "Ugh, it's hot!"
They both deposit a pinch of grass.
Bandit: "Okay, you know what? Can I order double Bingos?"
Bluey: "No! It's double Blueys forever! Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
Bingo: "My arms hurt."
Bandit sprays Bingo with the hose, washing off the chalk.
Bluey, Bingo: "Argh!"
They both giggle.
Bandit: "Double. Bingos!"
In the play room, Bingo has put on a towel turban. Bluey hands her a chalk.
Bluey: "Mm...yeah, here you go. Start on my tail."
Bingo swipes the chalk down Bluey's tail, leaving a stripe of orange. They both giggle.
Back out in the yard, Bandit is still watering the lawn.
Bingo: "Hi, Dad!"
Bandit looks behind himself: Bingo stands next to Bluey, who has been coloured with markings very similar to Bingo's.
Bandit: "Whoa!"
Bingo: "This is Big Bingo."
Bluey: "Hi. May we help you tidy these grass clippings away?"
Bandit: "Uh... Yeah?"
Bluey: "Come on, Mini Bingo.
They run off to the wheelbarrow. Bingo giggles.
Bandit: (quietly) "Result!"
At the wheelbarrow:
Bingo: "I like to pretend I'm hugging a wombat. Hug!"
She lifts a double-armful of grass clippings.
Bluey: "Hug!"
And so does Bluey.
"Now I put it to bed.
They gently deposit the grass clippings in the wheelbarrow.
Bingo: "Goodnight."
Bluey: "Night-night."
Bluey pats the pile of grass affectionately. They both giggle."
In the girls' bedroom, Chilli is looking under Bluey's bed.
Chilli: "Where are you, Shmyrtle?"
Bluey: "Here he is!"
Chilli looks up. Bluey stands behind her, holding up the book in question.
Chilli: "Oh!"
In the kitchen, Chilli adds it to the stack of library books.
Chilli: "Thanks, um..."
Bluey: "Big Bingo!"
Chilli: "...Big Bingo."
Bandit walks in and ruffles Bluey's hair.
Bandit: "Double Bingo!"
Bluey chuckles.
Bandit: "I could definitely get used to this."
Bluey's face falls.
Bluey: "What?!"
Chilli: (hissing) "Bandit!"
Bandit: "Oh, uh... I didn't mean..."
Bluey runs out of the room.
Bandit: "Oh, Bluey, wait."
Bingo runs after her.
Bingo: "Big Bingo!"
Bandit and Chilli look after them, sadly. After a moment, Bandit looks at Chilli.
Bandit: (quietly) "But, seriously, how good's double Bingo?"
Chilli: (quietly) "Yeah, I know!"
In the girls' bedroom, Bluey is sitting on Bingo's bed, holding her knees.
Bingo: "Hi, Big Bingo."
Bluey: "I wasn't sure which bed to sit on."
Bingo hops up on the bed and sits down next to Bluey.
Bingo: "Are you okay?"
Bluey: "Mum and Dad want two of yous. They don't want any of mes."
Bingo: "It's very rude."
Bluey: "It's because I'm annoying and you're not annoying at all."
Bingo: "Yes, I am. I'm super annoying."
Bluey: "Really?"
Bingo: "Yeah! I'm just different annoying. Here, I'll show you."
Bingo hops off the bed and looks under it.
Bingo: "Where's the sticky tape?"
Bluey grabs the sticky tape off the bookshelf.
Bluey: "Here you go."
Bingo: "Oop, thanks."
She takes a strip of tape.
Bingo: "And can you find the fake teeth for me?"
Bluey: "Ooh, OK!"
Bluey grabs a set of novelty fake teeth off the ledge, while Bingo tapes her nose to her forehead, pulling it way up.
Bluey: "Here you go!"
Bingo pops in the teeth.
Bluey: "Agh!"
Bingo: "Agheee..."
Bluey: "You look crazy!"
Bingo: "Follow me."
Bluey squeals, delighted.
In the living room, Bandit lays down on the couch with a newspaper.
Bandit: "Oh, man!"
He turns the page.
Bandit: "Chill the beans."
He turns the page again. As the paper closes, he spots Bingo, who has now gone wall-eyed and is carrying a globe. Bandit screams and throws the paper into the air.
Bingo: "Eeee..."
Bingo slowly walks towards him.
Bandit: "Bingo! What?!"
Bingo: "Eeee..."
Bandit: (chuckling) "Stop it!"
Bandit climbs onto the back of the couch to get away from her. Bingo climbs onto the cushions.
Bandit: "You're freakin' me out!"
Bingo: "Eeee..."
Bandit falls off the back of the couch.
Bandit: "Ooh! Get away from me!"
Bandit gets up and runs into the kitchen. Chilli enters the living room, looking behind her to watch Bandit.
Chilli: "What's going on in—"
She comes face-to-face with Bingo, standing on the arm of the couch.
Bingo: "Eeee..."
Chilli: "Aaah! (chuckling) Bingo—"
Chilli backs up. Bingo jumps off the arm of the couch to follow her.
Bingo: "Eeee..."
Chilli: "Aaah!"
Chilli runs into the kitchen. Bingo follows, and Bluey comes after, doing the best impression of Bingo she can without tape or false teeth.
Bluey, Bingo: "Eeee..."
In the second floor hallway, Chilli runs past the pantry cupboard.
Chilli: "Agh! Bingo! Stop it!"
The pantry door opens — Bandit was hiding inside. Bingo and Bluey slowly catch up.
Bluey, Bingo: "Eeee..."
Bandit: "In here!"
Chilli: "Aaagh!"
Chilli runs into the cupboard, and the door slams just before Bluey and Bingo get there.
Bluey, Bingo: "Eeee..."
Bluey and Bingo bang on the door with their fists. Inside the cupboard, Chilli and Bandit sit on the floor. Bandit yells through the door:"
Bandit: "That's it! We want one Bluey and one Bingo from now on! You got that?!"
Outside the cupboard, Bluey whispers something in Bingo's ear.
Bluey: "Okay!"
Bluey and Bingo run off giggling.
Back inside the cupboard, Bandit eats a piece of raw spaghetti.
Chilli: "Do you think it's safe?"
Bandit: "I think so. It's been 20 minutes."
Bandit cautiously opens the door and peers outside. He steps out, followed by Chilli. They spot something off screen, and jump back.
Bandit, Chilli: "Argh!"
Big Bingo and Mini Bluey wave.
Bluey, Bingo: "Hi!"
Chilli, Bandit: "Eh, close enough."
The episode theme plays over the credits. Bluey and Mini Bluey appear, making annoying noises.
Bluey, Bingo: "Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp!"
The music ends. Bluey and Bingo keep going.
Bluey, Bingo: "Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp! Borp!"
