Script
(The episode starts outside the house with Bluey being heard, singing. Bandit is making toast, and Bingo is reading.)
Bluey (singing): Oh! Where is my toast?!
Bandit: Bluey! Can you be as quiet as Bingo for a bit?
Bluey (singing): No I can't!
Chilli: (Walks in) Bluey, I can't find your library books and they're due back. Have you seen Shmurdle The Dirty Turtle?
Bluey (singing): No, I have not seen Shmurdle The Dirty Turtle!
Chilli: You have to keep better track of your things.
Bluey (singing): What about Bingo?!
Chilli (offscreen): Bingo puts hers in a neat pile when she's read them.
Bingo: Finished.
Bandit: Ding, orders up!
Bluey: Ooh! Cheese and jam! (chomping)
Bingo: Dad, I don't like cheese and jam.
Bandit: What? I thought you did! 
Bingo: No, Bluey does. I like banana and peanut butter.
Bluey: Bleh!
Bandit: How can you two come from the same parents,
be raised in the same house, but be completely different?
Bluey and Bingo: Don't know.
Bandit: Well, I'll tell you this for free-- my life would be a lot easier if you both were the same.
Chilli: Tell me about it.
Bluey: Bingo, I've got an idea!
Bingo: Okay!
(both run off, giggling)
Bandit: Wait what? Hang on-- (groans)
Chilli: Why do you keep setting them up?
(More coming soon)
