TITLE CARD: Muffin Unboxing
The minisode starts by showing a video from Muffin's channel titled: "Muffin's Toys: Dump Truck Review".
The video's intro is shown, containing a purple gradient background with a half-cut image of Muffin smiling with her arms raised. Along with a rainbow logo that reads: "Muffin's Toys" and a small rainbow on the bottom. The logo and Muffin expand in size as cheerful music plays in the background along with two stars appearing on the top right and bottom left corner.
Then the video's intro card ends with the video transitioning to Stripe still setting up the camera. Muffin is seen sitting down on a white and pink chair with a white table in front of her. Behind is a corkboard containing a picture of Cat Squad, drawings of a sunflower, a heart, a rainbow, and two posters of a hand giving the thumbs up pose and a subscribe button. Along with that, a shelf containing various toys, a tiara, and two books are seen. Finally, three lines of flags are also decorated in the background.
Stripe eventually gets the camera focused and says to Muffin:
Stripe: (O.S.) "Okay, go."
Muffin: (*waving*) "Hi everybody I'm Muffin. Welcome to my unboxing video."
Muffin unexpectedly gets off the chair and starts walking off camera.
Muffin: "Uh, dad, I have to go to the toilet."
Stripe: (O.S.) "Muff-!"
A beep sound is heard as the scene transitions to Muffin back in her seat. Retaking the intro again.
Muffin: "Hi, welcome to my unboxing video. Today, we're going to open this dump truck."
Muffin turns her body to the left; arms outstretch to present the dump truck to the viewers. But the dump truck is nowhere to be seen.
The next scene transitions to now have the dump truck be placed next to Muffin. Along with a chime sound effect accompanied with it to make it seem like it popped out of thin air.
Muffin: "Dad, I don't want a dump truck. I want Cat Squad Kitty Island!"
Stripe: (O.S.) "Muffin, this is the one they sent us, okay? Just say the line."
As Stripe says this, Muffin becomes annoyed and gives him a pouty look. Then she throws her arms in the air as if throwing a tantrum.
Muffin: "But I WANT Cat Squad Kitty Island!"
A beep sound is heard again as the scene transitions to Muffin finally calmed down but still with an annoyed look on her face.
Muffin: "Okay, so I'll open this bit."
She tries to do so but ends up struggling to open the box. She grunts as she pulls hard on the box.
Muffin: "It's stuck!"
Muffin stands on the chair to pull on the box harder, but all of a sudden, she loses her grip after pulling extremely hard and she falls off the chair with the dump truck toy flying off camera. She squeaks when she falls.
Another beep sound is heard again as the scene transitions to Muffin screaming as she is aggressively banging the dump truck on the table trying to get it to open.
Stripe: (O.S.) "Don't break it Muffin!"
And another beep sound is heard again as the scene transitions to Stripe now in front of the camera. He managed to take the dump truck out of the box but cannot get it out of it's safety strap. Muffin is now off her chair, watching her dad with an unamused expression.
Stripe: "*Grunts* Come on!"
Stripe now starts aggressively banging the box on the table too. And even tugs on the string too.
Muffin: "I told you!"
Yet another beep sound is heard again as the scene transitions to Trixie also in front of the camera as well. The dump truck is now off its safety strap, but the wheels had most likely come off off-camera, so Trixie is trying to put them back in. Both Stripe and Muffin look at Trixie with annoyed expressions.
Trixie: "*Grunts* You've really done a number on this thing!"
Another beep sound is heard again as the scene transitions to Muffin now sitting back in her chair with a bored expression on her face. The dump truck now finally out of the box and is placed next to Muffin.
Muffin: "*Flatly* This is the dump truck..."
Stripe: (O.S.) "*Whispering* Push the button."
Muffin: "*Groans loudly* You push this button, and it does this."
Muffin presses the white button on the truck, but nothing happens.
Stripe: (O.S.) "Push it harder."
Muffin presses the white button again, but nothing happens.
Muffin: "It's not working!"
Stripe: (O.S.) "Push it properly."
Muffin: "I AM!"
Muffin slams her hand onto the truck, and it falls on the floor.
Another beep sound is heard as the scene transitions to Stripe now back in front of the camera trying to put batteries into the truck. As there wasn't any to begin with. Muffin is still sitting in her chair, with batteries scattered in front of her.
Muffin: "You have to remember to but pattewies in it first!"
After a few seconds of silence, we hear truck like noises playing off camera indicating that Stripe was able to get the truck working.
Stripe: "Ah thank-."
Another beep sound is heard as the scene transitions to Muffin still with a bored expression on her face, now demonstrating how the dump truck works. The truck turns on as the sound effects play and colorful lights flash shine on the truck. The dump truck then tips its dump box as Muffin looks with interest.
Muffin: "Oh, that's pretty cool."
Another beep sound is heard as the scene transitions to an up-close shot of Muffin still with a bored expression on her face as she talks again.
Muffin: "*flatly* Maybe I should put some rocks in the back..."
Stripe pushes a jar of jellybeans to her. Muffin quickly takes notice of it and immediately jumps on top of the table and starts aggressively scarfing down a wad of jellybeans. Stripe quickly goes over to Muffin's side and tries to stop her.
Stripe: "Muffin! NO!"
Stripe quickly grabs the jar as Muffin tries to snatch it back.
Muffin: "Hey! (continues eating the jellybeans)."
Stripe: "They're for the video! Give me those!"
A final beep is heard as the scene transitions to Muffin sitting back in her chair, arms crossed and with an annoyed expression. Her younger sister Socks is standing in front of the camera, intrigued by the dump truck.
Muffin: "This is a dump truck. It is the WORST toy ever! I HATE it!"
Muffin looks away from the truck with a bitter expression. After a few seconds of silence, Socks asks Muffin something.
Socks: "Can I have it?"
Muffin: "NO IT'S MINE!"
As she says this, Muffin aggressively swipes the truck away from Socks and looks with at her with an agitated face.
The video ends with the outro with a green gradient end card with a recommended video displaying of Muffin grinning while pointing towards a Chattermax toy. Showing its an unboxing video for a Chattermax toy. Along with that, a message for giving the video a like is shown along with an arrow pointing to the subscribe button. Which ironically is pointing to the like button instead.
Cheerful music plays in the background till the end title card is shown, ending the minisode.
