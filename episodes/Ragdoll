The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler house in daytime.
Bluey: ♫ "Down by the banks of the Hanky Panky ♫
The scene changes to the laundry room. Bluey is dance-marching along as she sings.
Bluey: ♫ "Where the bullfrog— ♫
Bluey notices a ten dollar note on the floor. She stops singing and gasps. She holds it up to the camera.
Bluey: "Moneys!"
In the kids' bedroom, Bingo lays on the watermelon rug. She's singing, and following the ceiling fan with her eyes.
Bingo: ♫ "...jump from bank to banky. With an eeps, ipes, opes, oops." ♫
Bluey runs in and waves the money over Bingo's face."
Bluey: "Bingo! Monies!"
Bingo: "Monies?"
Bingo jumps up, and they both wag their tails in excitement.
Bingo & Bluey: "MONIES!"
In the living room, Bandit is lying on the couch, reading an absurdly tiny book. Bluey and Bingo run in.
Bluey: "Dad, can drive us to the corner shop to buy an ice-cream!? With our monies!"
Bandit: "Correction:"
He closes the book and snatches the bill from Bluey's hand.
Bandit: "You found my monies."
Bandit tucks the money under his bum and reopens his book.
Bluey & Bingo: "Hey, that's ours!"
Bandit: "No, it's mine. I must have dropped it."
Bluey: "Yeah, and we found it!"
Bingo: "Which make it OURS!"
Bingo stomps her foot for emphasis.
Bandit: "Uh-uh, you have to work for money, kids."
Bingo: "No you don't. It comes from the machine in the wall, I've seen it."
Bluey: "Yeah, you have just to push buttons."
Bandit: "There's more to it than that."
Bingo: "This is OUTRAGEOUS!"
Bingo stomps her foot again.
Bluey: "Yeah, we want ice-cream."
Bandit: "Ice-cream tastes the best when you've earned it."
Bluey: (skeptically) "That's not true."
Bandit: "Well, let's find out."
Bandit puts the book down and stands up.
Bandit: "Come on, in the car. Let's go."
Bluey jumps for the excitement. The girls' tails begin to wag.
Bluey: "What?! Are we having ice-cream?!"
Bandit: "Yep, I'll drive you to the corner shop."
Bluey and Bingo squeal in joy and start to run to the car.
Bandit: "Oh, just one thing."
Bluey & Bingo: "Huh?"
Bandit touches his nose.
Bandit: "Boop!"
Bandit collapses limply to the floor."
Bandit: "Ragdoll!"
Bluey & Bingo: "Oh, no! Not Ragdoll!"
TITLE CARD - Ragdoll
Bandit: "This episode of Bluey is called: Ragdoll."
The scene resumes. Bingo pushes on Bandit's stomach, while Bluey tries pressing his nose again.
Bingo: "Dad, come on!"
Bluey: "We don't want to play Ragdoll. We just want ice-cream."
Bandit: "Sounds good! I just need some help getting to the car."
Bluey: "Agh!"
Bluey turns and yells with cupped hands.
Bluey: "MUUUM!"
Bandit: "Your mum's at work, earning monies."
Bingo: "It's not that far to the car. We just need to pull him."
Bingo grabs an arm and starts to pull.
Bluey: "Okay, I'll push from this side."
Bluey: "Ready? Go!"
Bluey throws her weight against Bandit's hip while Bingo pulls. They both grunt with effort, and Bandit moves almost imperceptibly.
Bluey: "He moved!"
Bingo: "Hurray!"
Bluey: "Now, pull on that leg, I'll push his bum."
Bluey and Bingo slowly turn Bandit almost ninety degrees.
Bandit: "I wonder what flavour ice-cream I'll get."
Bluey: "It's working!"
Bingo: "It's very slow, though."
Bluey: "Let's try rolling him."
Bingo: "Okay!"
Bingo climbs over Bandit's face."
Bandit: "Maybe Choc chip. Mmm! Choc Mint?"
Bluey: "Ready, set go!"
Bluey and Bingo both heave at Bandit's back, rolling him over onto his face.
Bandit: "Bubblegum. Salted caramel."
'Bluey and Bingo grunt, rolling him over another half-turn.
Bandit: "No, wait! Pistachio! Definitely pistachio."
Bluey and Bingo grunt and roll him another half turn. They've almost gotten him off the rug.
Bandit: "Hurry up, kids! I want an ice-cream!"
Bluey & Bingo: "We are going as fast as we can!"
The continue rolling him, until he reaches the door. The all grunt as he hits the doorway - he's sideways, and won't fit through.
Bandit: "Oop! Square peg in a round hole."
Bingo: "Ooh! I know."
Bingo runs off, while Bluey braces her back against Bandit and tries to force him through.
Bluey: "Argh. Dad. This is too hard!"
Bandit: (wisely) "Obstacles do not block' the path, they are the path."
Bluey: "I don't understand what you're saying!"
Bingo returns, rolling the green yoga ball.
Bingo: "Bluey, you lift him up that way!"
Bluey: "Ugh. Okay."
They both grunt, as Bluey pulls on Bandit's arm, lifting his torso, and Bingo wedges the ball underneath him.
Bluey: "This is hard work!"
Bandit: "A bit of hard work never hurt anyone."
Bluey grunts one more time and tips him over, and he falls sideways through the doorway. His head hits the floor.
Bandit: "Ooh! Okay, that actually did hurt."
Bluey: "Come on, Bingo!"
Bluey and Bingo clamber over Bandit to get into the hallway.
Bandit: "That's it kids! If you get knocked down seven times, you get up eight!"
Bandit: "There's no 'I' in 'team'."
Bluey: "Dad! stop talking!"
Bingo: "Bluey, look!"
Bluey: "Oh yeah! This will be easy."
The camera pulls back, all the way down the living room staircase to the landing
Bandit "What will be easy?"
The scene cuts to Bandit sliding down the stairs backwards on his belly.
Bandit: "Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!"
Bandit: "Obstacles— Oh!"
Bandit: "Are placed— Ooh!"
Bandit:: "In our way— Ugh!"
Bandit: "To see if want we want... Ow!"
Bandit: "Is really worth... Urgh!"
Bandit: "Fighting for!"
Bluey & Bingo: "Whoo! Go, dad!"
Bandit slides down the last few stairs.
Bandit: "Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!"
Bluey and Bingo giggle as he comes to a stop at the landing.
Bingo: "Help me get him around the corner."
They both groan and push on his back.
Bluey: "He's stuck!"
Bluey and Bingo clamber over Bandit again.
Bluey: "Even if we get him out of the house, we still have to get him all the way across the yard to the car. It's impossible!"
Bandit: (wisely) "Great works are performed not by great strength but by perseverance."
Bluey puts her hands on her hips.
Bluey: "Hang on! Are you trying to teach us something?"
Bandit: (wisely) "One must persevere—"
Bluey: "Awww! He is!"
Bingo: "What?!"
Bandit: "Okay, yes, I'm trying to teach you the value of hard work."
Bingo: "Why do you keep trying to teach us things that we don't want to learn!?"
Bandit: "Becuase i don't want you growing up to be lazy."
Bluey: "Ugh. That's it. We're not going any further."
Bluey sits down on the bottom step, sulking.
Bandit: "What, you don't want ice-cream?"
Bluey: "No, you can keep your monies."
Bingo joins her.
Bandit: "Okay."
No one speaks for a few seconds.
Bingo: "Bluey?"
Bluey: "Yes?"
Bingo: "I do want ice-cream."
Bluey: "Me too."
Bluey: "Right, come on, we're getting this big blue guy in the car."
Bluey gets up and starts trying to unwedge one of Bandit's feet.
Bingo & Bandit: "Hurray!"
Bingo clambers onto Bandit to untangle his other leg.
Bluey: "But. We're not learning anything. Got it?"
Bandit: "Got it."
Bandit: "But do yourself a favor."
Bandit: (wisely) "Don't work hard' if you can work smart."
Bluey: "Hm..."
Bluey rolls a skateboard to the bottom of the stairs.
Bluey: "Ready, Bingo?"
Bingo: "Ready!"
Bluey and Bingo grunt and push on Bandit's back. He rolls down the last two steps and lands on the skateboard.
Bandit: "OW!"
Bluey & Bingo: "YEAH!"
Bandit groans.
The scene changes to the foyer. Bluey and Bingo are pulling Bandit by his legs. They've tied roller skates on his wrists so they will also roll."
Bingo: "This is easy!"
They pull him through the front door onto the porch. Bandit gets jostled as the skateboard goes over the threshold.
'Bandit: Ooh! Ohh!"
Bluey: "That's the car!"
Bingo: "Hurray!"
Bluey: "Let's skateboarding him down the stairs!"
Bandit: "WHAT!? No, do not skateboard me down those stairs."
Bluey: "Okay, fine."
Wendy, wearing sweatbands and carrying weights, power-walks by the Heelers' house.
Wendy: ♫ "Where the Bullfrog jumps from—" ♫
Bluey and Bingo drop Bandit, who slides down the front steps on his bum.
Bandit: "Argh! Ooh! Ooh!"
Wendy: "Oh, my goodness!"
Bluey & Bingo: "Hurray!"
Bandit: "Morning, Wendy!"
Wendy rushes to help.
Wendy: "What's going on? Are you okay?"
Bingo: "He stole our monies!"
Wendy: "What?!"
Bandit: "Oh that's putting a bit of slant on it."
Bluey: "He said he'll only give it back if we carry him all the way to the car."
Wendy: "Is that right?"
Bandit: "Just keep walking, Wendy. This doesn't concern you."
Wendy: "It does now. Come, on girls."
Wendy drops her weights and grabs Bandit's feet.
Bandit: "Hey, Wendy, watch the hands."
They all grunt as they roll Bandit through the front yard.
Wendy: "Bossing around young children!"
They all grunt again
Wendy: "Honestly!"
Bandit: "Hey, hey, hey! watch the prickles!"
Bandit falls on his stomach, finally at the door.
Bandit: "Ow!"
Bluey: "Argh! We'll never lift him into the car seat! He's too heavy!"
Bandit: "Ah well, whatcha gonna do."
Wendy: "Get the door, girls. I'll show you what 10 years of Pilates can do."
Bandit: "Hey, hey Wendy, what are you doing?!"
Wendy crouches down, with Bandit behind her. She has both hands underneath him
Wendy: "Pay attention, girls. Ready? Engage the core, straight back. Ready, Wendy? And... Heeeeeave!"
She gradually lifts Bandit off the ground, thighs bulging.
Bandit: "Look at those quads!"
Bluey and Bingo: "Wow!"
Wendy: (straining) "Promise me you'll work hard to maintain a strong core, girls. Don't get lazy!"
Bluey and Bingo: "Yes, Wendy. We won't!"
Wendy grunts as she finally lifts Bandit into the driver's seat.
Bluey and Bingo: "YEAAAAH!"
Wendy stretches her arms proudly.
Bluey: Now we can have ice-cream!"
Bandit slumps forward, honking the horn with his nose.
Wendy: "Ooh!"
Wendy pushes Bandit back into his seat.
Bandit: (smugly) "I'm not sure I should be driving in this condition."
Bluey and Bingo: "WHAT?!"
Bingo: "So we don't get ice cream?"
Bandit: "Not unless you can drive--
Wendy shoves him into the passenger's footwell."
Bandit: "Ooh!"
Wendy jumps into the driver's seat and buckles up. She hooks her thumb at the backseat.
Wendy: "Strap yourselves in, kids! I'll drive you to the shops."
Bluey & Bingo: "Hurray!"
The scene cuts to Wendy driving the car down the road. Bandit is now sitting in the passenger seat, buckled in, slumped limply against the window."
Wendy, Bingo, Bluey: ♫ "Down by the banks of the Hanky Panky, where the bullfrogs jumps from bank to banky. with a hip!" ♫
The scene cuts to the corner shop. Bluey and Bingo are seated at a table outside, with Bandit parked in the car right next to them. He leans limply out the open window. Wendy comes out with three green ice-cream pops. She gives one to Bluey and Bingo.
Wendy: "Here you go, my darlings."
Bluey & Bingo: "Thanks, Wendy!"
Bandit: ""Thanks, Wendy?" I paid for them!"
Wendy: "Oh, yes. Here's your change."
She balances three coins on Bandit's nose. Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "Okay, Bluey. Now you can take a lick."
Bluey licks the ice cream, and the scene transitions to a metaphorical space. A green and white kaleidoscope surrounds her, then she slides down a river of green liquid suspended in space. She falls upwards into a sea of green, surrounded by a bubble. The scene rotates a hundred and eighty degrees as the bubble pops. Bluey hangs upside down from the bottom of a large bubble, deeper in the sea of green. She jumps from green platform to green platform, separated by rivers of vanilla. She spins joyously on a rippling green plane, in front of a green rainbow, as green fireworks go off behind her. The camera zooms into Bluey, then back out from her face into the real world.
Bluey: (shakily) "Whoa. This is the best ice-cream I've ever tasted."
Bandit springs to life, pointing at Bluey. The coins fall to the table.
Bandit: "HA! I told you!"
Bingo grabs a coin.
Bingo: Monies!"
The music from the flavor montage, a bright synthesizer melody, plays over the ending credits. Instead of Bluey dancing, green fireworks burst.
