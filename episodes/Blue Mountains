The episode opens in a grassy meadow. Bandit is laying on his back on a picnic blanket. Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo are approaching him. They have all drawn faces on their right hands, with markers and googly eyes. Bingo's hand is also decorated with a flower crown and feather wings. They walk their fingers over the picnic blanket, using their hands as puppets.
Chilli: Once, there were two sisters:
The episode cuts to an extreme close up on their hands, giving us a puppets-eye view. Chilli's puppet has a frown and worried expression. Bluey's is smiling. Bluey's puppet picks up a fork.
Chilli: Big Sister --
Chilli: (as Big Sister) Hi!
Chilli: And Little Sister.
Bluey: (as Little Sister) Hi!
Bingo: And also, a little fairy.
Chilli: Oh, yes! And also, a little fairy.
Little Sister spins in a circle, flailing her fork.
Little Sister: Eeee!
Big Sister: Whoa! Be careful, Little Sister! You'll have someone's eye out
with that thing.
Little Sister drops the fork.
Little Sister: And the Big Sister was no fun at all.
Big Sister: Hey! I'm lots of fun!
Little Sister: Nuh-uh!
Chilli: Anyway, it was winter
and very cold.
Big Sister: Brrrr! We need to find somewhere warm to sleep, little sister!
Bingo: (as Little Fairy) I know a place that's got the softest, warmest beds in the whole world.
Little Sister: Where are they, Little Fairy?
Little Fairy: Beyond the Blue Mountains!
An extreme low-angle shot of Bandit's feet, knees, and stomach, framing them as a mountain range.
Little Sister: Yay! The Blue Mountains!
TITLE CARD - Blue Mountains
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called the Blue Mountains.
Back to the opening shot, showing whole characters.
Chilli: (as Big Sister) No way are we going to the Blue Mountains.
Cut back to the puppets-eye view.
Big Sister: It's too dangerous!
Little Sister: I told you she was no fun. Race you!
Bingo: (giggles)
Big Sister: Hey!
Little Sister and Little Fairy run off together. They stop when they encounter Bandit's tail.
Little Sister: Whoa, look!
Big Sister hides behind a sandwich.
Big Sister: Stay back, Little Sister! We don't know what that is!
Little Sister: (giggles) Don't worry. It's friendly.
Little Sister briefly lifts up the tail and lets it drop.
Big Sister: Brrr! We'd best get going.
Cut to Bandit's foot. Little Sister and Little Fairy leap onto his foot and begin climbing his leg.
Little sister: Hooray!
Cut to Bandit's shin. Little Sister is skipping backwards up the slope.
Big Sister: This is too steep.
Little sister: Oh, big sister, don't be a stick in the mud.
Cut to Bandit's knee. The girls enjoy a panoramic view.
Big Sister: (gasps)
Little Sister: What a view!
Big Sister: How do we get down?
Little Fairy: We slide! Whee!
Little Sister: Whee!
They both slide down Bandit's thigh. Big sister hesitates.
Big Sister: Okay. Here we goooo!
Big Sister also slides down. We cut back to Chilli.
Chilli: (laughs)
Chilli licks her finger and erases Big Sister's frown, then draws a smile on instead. Back in puppet-vision, Big Sister is sliding down Bandit's thigh.
Big Sister: Whee! Yeah! That was fun!
The three of them are bouncing on Bandit's belly.
Little Sister: It's so soft and squishy! Boing! Boing!
Big Sister: It *is* soft and squishy, isn't it, little sister? It's like we're bouncing on a massive pikelet.
Bandit: (growls)
As Bandit growls, the screen shakes and rumbling sound effects suggest an earthquake.
Little Sister: What's happening?
Bandit folds his arms, creating a massive wall across his chest.
All: Aaaah!
Little Sister: How are we gonna get past this big wall?
Big Sister: It's too high to climb!
Little Sister: We'll never find the softest, warmest beds in the whole world.
Little Fairy: My sweeties, there's a secret spot somewhere here. We just have to find it.
Big Sister: Oh, yes! And if we scratch it, it makes the wall come tumbling down.
Little Sister: Hee, okay!
Big Sister: You try over there.
Little Sister tickles Bandit. He laughs lightly. Big Sister tickles Bandit. He laughs harder. Little Fairy tickles Bandit. He laughs even harder.
Little Sister: This is the spot!
Big Sister and Little Fairy come and tickle the same spot.
Little Fairy: Yeah, that's the spot!
Big Sister: You got it!
Bandit laughs and raises his arms. All three begin running towards his chest.
All: Aaaah!
Big Sister: Run for your lives!
Bandit's arms slam back down behind them.
All: Hooray!
They dance and laugh.
Big Sister: Yeah! Oh, I'm having so much fun, little sister. Maybe I do just need to relax and enjoy myself more. I wonder why I ever stopped in the first place.
Bandit: (offscreen) Well, hello!
Bandit's hand puppet appears. He's stuck a nose and tail on his hand, and drawn pointy ears on his wrist. He's even given his puppet shoes and a monobrow.
Bandit: (as the fox) I am a kindly fox.
Big Sister: Oh, look at this cute little fella.
The Fox: You wouldn't be looking for the warmest, softest beds in the whole world, would you?
Big Sister: We are!
The Fox: Well, you're in luck. I can show you the way.
Big Sister: Oh, great! Did you hear that, kids?
Little Sister: Big sister, I think he's a cheeky fox.
Big Sister: A what?! No, he's a kindly fox. He said so. Ooh, look at his cute little tail.
The camera cuts to the fox doing leg stretches. His right eye falls off, and he puts it back on. When the camera cuts back, Little Sister is frowning.
Little Sister: I'm not so sure.
Big Sister: Oh, come on, little sister. Now who's being boring?
Little Sister: Hey!
Little Fairy: Little sister, we need to find the softest, warmest beds in the whole world, otherwise, we'll freeze.
Little Sister: Oh, all right.
Big Sister: Okay, kindly fox. We'd love you to show us the way.
The Fox: Oh, very good! Right this way.
Bandit hums as they walk across his chest. Big Sister addresses the fox privately as they walk.
Big Sister: I'm usually a real worry wart, but this trek to the Blue Mountains has really shown me how to relax and have fun.
The Fox: Oh, splendid!
Little Sister: I've got my eye on you, Mr Fox.
The Fox: That sister of yours is hard work, isn't she?
Big Sister: She sure is.
They arrive at Bandit's open mouth.
Little Sister: It's a cave!
Big Sister: Oh, wow, it stinks!
The Fox: (muffled, as Bandit is trying not to move his mouth) I'm sure it's not that bad.
Big Sister: Oh, Kindly Fox, is there something wrong with your voice?
The Fox: (muffled) Uh, no, I just like to talk like this sometimes.
Big Sister: Very strange. Well, we best get going. Are you coming, too, Kindly Fox?
The Fox: (muffled) Uh, I actually have to go and buy some more... hand cream.
Big Sister: Okay. Thanks for your help.
The Fox: (muffled) Yep. In you go.
The Fox leaves.
Little Sister: I'm not sure this is a good idea.
Big Sister: Oh, quiet, Little Sister. Now who's a stick in the mud? Last one into the cave's a rotten egg!
Big sister runs towards the cave; Little Sister and Little Fairy chase her.
Big Sister: Ah! I'm winning! Yeah!
She reaches Bandit's mouth, which slams shut on her. Saliva sprays everywhere.
Big Sister: (muffled) Aaah!
Little Fairy and Litte Sister: (gasp)
Little Fairy: Big Sister!
Big Sister: (muffled) Help, Little Sister!
Chilli: (out of character, laughing) He's licking me!
Big Sister: (muffled) Let me out!
Little Sister: It was a trick! What are you gonna do?!
The Fox: (laughs)
Little Sister: You! You are a cheeky fox! That's it. No one traps my big sister. Hyah!
Little Sister picks up The Fox, and with Little Fairy's help, throws him. He lands with his legs lodged in Bandit's nostrils.
Little Sister: Wait for it! Wait for it!
Bandit: Bleahh!
Bandit, unable to breathe, spits out Big Sister, and sends The Fox flying into the sun.
All: Yeah!
The sisters and fairy land on the picnic blanket. Big Sister is covered in spit. Her eye falls off, and she puts it back on.
Big Sister: Ew. I'm all slimy!
Little Sister: Big sister! Oh, I'm so glad you're safe! 
They embrace, wetly.
Little Sister: I promise I'll never say you're boring ever again.
Big Sister: Oh, I was so busy trying to be fun, I forgot the most important thing big sisters are meant to do.
Little Sister: What's that?
Big Sister: Look after their little sisters.
Little Fairy: Look!
Little Fairy points to Bandit's ears.
Little Sister: The softest, warmest beds in the whole world!
Big Sister: Yeah!
Little Fairy: We found them! Hooray!
Big Sister: Oh, it's so soft. And look, there's enough wax in here to make a hundred candles!
Bandit pokes Big Sister with the tip of his ear.
Big Sister: Ohh!
Bluey, Bingo, Chilli, and Bandit all laugh.
The puppets are shown sleeping under Bandit's ear.
Chilli: And they all slept happily ever after.
An up-tempo arrangement of the episode theme plays during the credits.
