The episode opens in the side yard of the Heelers' house. It's nighttime. In the center of the screen are two wheelie bins, one with a red lid, and one with a yellow lid. Bluey and Bingo run in from screen left, followed by Bandit. Bluey is wearing a karate gi with a white belt. Bingo carries a box of cardboard trash, and Bandit is carrying a bin bag. Their breath forms fog clouds in the air.
Bluey and Bingo: Hi, bins.
Bandit flaps the lid of the red bin, making a puppet. He speaks for it in a deep, gravelly voice.
Red Bin: Hey, those dogs are back. Ooh, they got food. Gimme. Gimme.
Bandit puts the garbage in the red bin.
Red Bin: Ahh. Om nom nom nom. Green curry. Oh, that's good. Om nom nom nomf. Burnt rice. Oh, that's not so good. Oh wait— are these— yeah—
Bandit shakes the bin back and forth as it "chews" excitedly.
Red Bin: SPRING ROLLS! Om nom nom nom nom. Yah om nom nom.
Bandit steps over to the yellow bin, which he gives a gentle, higher-pitched voice.
Yellow Bin: Hey man, what about me?
Bingo: Just cardboard tonight, yellow bin.
Bingo dumps the box of cardboard into the yellow bin.
Yellow Bin: That's cool, man. I love cardboard.
Bluey and Bingo: (giggle)
The scene changes to another view of the side yard. Bluey walks in, followed by Bandit. Bandit is pulling both bins behind him; Bingo is hanging from the handles of the red bin. Bluey takes big breaths, purposely making fog clouds.
Bandit: Hey, how was kindy, Bingo?
Bingo: Good. There's a new kid. His name's Banjo.
Bandit: Oh, way to go. What's he like?
Bingo frowns for a moment.
Bingo: I don't know.
The scene cuts to a wider view of the cul-de-sac. The moon is out; it is a waxing quarter moon. The Heelers' neighbour Doreen is putting out her bins. She's wearing curlers. The Heelers enter from screen left, and Bandit starts positioning the bins.
Bandit: Hi, Doreen.
Doreen waves.
Doreen: Hiii. Ooh, your bin's full. Mr. Crow will be coming tomorrow.
Bluey throws a few punches, showing off her karate moves.
Bluey Yeah, Mr. Crow!
Red Bin: 'Night, girls.
Bluey and Bingo: 'Night, bins.
Doreen climbs the steps to her porch. Bluey and Bingo climb on Bandit's back for a piggyback ride. Bluey waves to the moon.
Bluey: 'Night, Moon.
TITLE CARD - Bin Night
Bluey : This episode of Bluey is called Bin Night.
The scene changes to a close up of the bins. It is now morning, and a crow has perched on the red bin. It's too full for the lid to close all the way, and he pecks at the bin bag through the opening.
The camera pulls back a bit. With a loud, tuneless whistle, Bluey jumps into frame playing a recorder. Mr. Crow is startled and flies away.
Bluey: (laughs)
The camera angle changes, we can now see the front porch behind Bluey. Chilli and Bingo are sitting on the porch. Chilli is drinking a cup of tea; Bingo is finishing a piece of toast with jam.
Chilli: Good one, Bluey!
Bingo: (laughs)
The shot changes to a close shot of Chilli and Bingo.
Chilli: Hey, Bingo, why don't you try and play with Banjo today?
Bingo: Why?
Chilli: Well, it can be hard being the new kid. He might like having someone to play with.
Bingo: Okay, Mama.
Bluey runs in from down screen and hops up to sit on the bottom step. She points off screen.
Bluey": Bin man's here.
The scene changes to show the cul-de-sac from over the Heelers' heads. A garbage truck stops in front of their bins, and the truck's robotic arm picks up the red bin and dumps it into the truck.
Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli: Whoa.
Chilli: There it goes.
Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli: Hooray! Thanks, bin man!
The Heelers wave to the garbage truck. The driver honks the horn twice in acknowledgement.
The shot changes back to show the Heelers.
Chilli: Come on. Let's get to school.
They stand up and walk up the steps to enter the house.
Bluey: Can I be a bin lady when I grow up?

Bluey: It's not Yellow Bin's turn, Red Bin.
Red Bin: Oh, I miss you, yellow bin.
Bingo: It's okay, red bin. (to Bluey) I think they're sisters.
Bandit: Hey, how was kindy, Bingo?
Bingo: Good. Wait. No. Bad.
Bluey starts practicing her karate forms again.
Bandit: Aw, why bad?
Bingo: Banjo called me a bobohead.
Bandit: What's a bobohead?
Bingo: I don't know.
Bandit: Did he call anyone else a bobohead?
Bingo: Yeah, he called everyone a bobohead.
Bandit crouches down, and the girls climb on for another piggyback ride.

Doreen: Ooh, bin's full this week, girls.
Bluey: We had a barbie!

Chilli puts her hand on Bingo's back reassuringly.
Bingo: Okay, mama.
Bluey enters and sits on the bottom step.
Bluey: Mum, can I be a scarecrow
when I grow up?
Chilli: If you like.
Bluey: Hooray!

Bandit: And what did she say?
The scene changes to the curb. The moon is now full. Bingo drops to the ground. Bandit starts setting up the bins.

Bluey: No, it's only red bin tonight.
Bandit: Are you sure?
Bluey: Yeah.
Bluey points at the moon. The shot pulls back to include Doreen again. Everyone looks at the moon as she explains.
Bluey: It's only both bins when the moon is a big moon, or a half moon, or a no moon. And tonight's not any of them.
The shot changes to show just the moon.
Bluey: (offscreen) Look, it's a smiley moon. That's my favourite.
The scene changes back to street level.
Bandit: Aw, you clever little dog.

Bluey: (to Bandit) Ooh, can I?
Bandit: If you like.
Bluey: Hooray!
