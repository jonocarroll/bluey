Kid: "Bluey! Ruff-ruff!"
The episode opens in the dining room. Bingo scoops up a spoonful of cereal.

She pretends to dig with her hands.
Bandit yawns.
Bandit: "What's today, kiddo? "
Bingo: "It's the weekend?"
Bandit: "That's right! How many games should we play?"
Bingo holds her arms out wide.
Bingo: "This many!"
Bandit: "Whoa! Okay, that's doable."
Bluey walks in from screen left. She has a robot claw toy, holding an envelope.
Bluey: "I've got a letter for you!"
Bandit: "Oh, thanks, Bluey! What have we got here?"
Bandit takes the envelope and opens it. Bluey rapidly clicks the claw.
Bluey: "It's a drumstick!"
Bandit: "Oh, you beauty!"
Bandit begins to drum on the table with the drumstick and his free hand, also stomping on the floor. After a moment, he starts making drum noises with his mouth as well. Bluey and Bingo start to dance.
Bandit: "Doom doom dah, doom doom dah, doom da doom dah dah! Brrrrrra tka tka babap boowww!"
TITLE CARD - The Weekend
Bandit's tabletop drum solo continues over the title card. The title is not read to the audience.
In the living room, a cricket game is on the television, the commentary is indistinct. Bandit can be heard grunting from off screen, as the kids laugh. A ball rolls into frame.
The scene cuts to the playroom. Bingo and Bluey are wrestling with Bandit, they have him pinned.
Bluey: "Don't let him get up!"
Bingo: "You're not getting up, ever!"
Bluey: "Stay on him! You're not going anywhere you wild beast!"
Bandit: "Ah! Oof!" 
Chilli walks in from screen right.
Bandit: "Ow! Ow! Ow!"
Chilli: "Okay, I'm just popping out for a tick."
Chilli continues walking, exiting to screen left.
Bingo: "Bye, Mum!"
Bluey: "See ya, Mum!"
Chili: (off screen) "I'll see you later."
Bandit tries to crawl after Chilli.
Bandit: "I've gotta give your mum a kiss."
Bluey jumps on him, crushing him to the ground.
Bluey: "No smoochy-kiss for you!"
Bandit: "Oh, no!"
The crowd at the cricket game roars.
Bandit: "Hang on, hang on! Shh, shh!"
Commentator: "And gone, Pat Taylor is gone."
Bandit: "Okay, I've— I've actually gotta watch this."
Bandit stands up halfway, but the kids tackle him to the floor again.
Bluey: "Noooo! Get his legs, Bingo!"
Bandit: "Ah, c'mon, I just want to see this wicket."
In the living room, Bandit walks in, carrying Bingo over his left shoulder, and Bluey under his right arm. He stands in front of the television.
Bluey: "Hey Bingo, you wanna play statues?"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
The girls squirm free and run out of the room.
Bandit: "How is that LBW?"
The girls stand on the stairs. Bingo has already taken a pose, standing on one leg with one arm up and one arm down.
Bluey: "Da-ad!"
Bandit: (off screen) "Coming!"
Bluey: "Da-ad!!"
Bandit: (off screen) "Yeah, I'm coming."
Bluey: "DAAAD!!!"
Bandit walks in.
Bandit: "Okay, okay. Bonjour!"
Bluey: "Oh, hello! Would you like to buy a statue?"
Bingo wobbles.
Bandit: "Ah, yes. I definitely would like to buy a statue. I— waitaminnit. These aren't magic statues, are they?"
Bluey: "Oh, no, these aren't magic. These are just normal statues."
Bandit: "Oh, good. 'Cause I've been down that road before. Whoop, pause the game."
Bandit pretends to press a button.
Bandit: "Beep!"
The scene cuts to the bathroom. Bandit sits on the toilet, looking at his phone. Bluey leans against the wall, reading a book. Bingo unrolls the toilet paper.
Bingo: (Frère Jacques) ♫ "Bilby digging, bilby digging! Cockatoo, cockatoo!" ♫
Bluey: "Phwoar, it stinks!"
Bluey pinches her nose.
Bandit: (laughing) "Well, you're welcome to wait outside, kiddo."
He nudges Bluey with his elbow.
Back at the stairs, everyone is back in position. Bandit pretends to press a button.
Bandit: "Boop! Unpause. Okay, I'd like that one, please."
Bluey: "Four hundred dollary-doos."
Bandit pretends to hand over a fistful of cash.
Bandit: "Thank you."
Bluey: (sing-song) "Enjoy your statue."
Bandit picks up Bingo. Bluey laughs.
Bandit carries Bingo to the back door to the verandah."
Bandit: "Now, where am I going to put this statue. Ah, yes."
He puts Bingo down near the door.
Bandit: "Just here. Ah, I forgot my change."
He walks out of frame.
Bluey: (off screen) "Hi."
Bingo runs and stands on a chair across the room.
Bandit: (off screen) "I think I forgot my change."
Bluey: (off screen) "Oh, yes, sir."
Bingo resumes her statue pose, giggling.
Bandit: (off screen) "Thank you, shopkeeper. I'll just get back to my statue..."
Bandit enters from screen right.
Bandit: "...which I'm sure is right over here— What?!"
Bingo laughs. Bandit turns around and spots her.
Bandit: "What's it doing over here? I could've sworn I left it over there. Oh well, I guess I'll just put it back.
He picks up Bingo and hums as he carries her, giggling, back to the spot by the door. Bluey is waiting.
Bluey: "Is everything okay?"
Bandit: "I think so. I could've sworn I left the statue here, but I found it over there."
Bluey: "Well... You're probably just going crazy or something."
Bingo runs out the back door.
Bandit: "Oh yes. Probably."
The door closes.
Bandit: "Huh?"
In the back yard, Bingo carefully walks down the back stairs. She holds the railing, and puts both feet on each step before continuing.
Bandit: (off screen) "Where's my statue?"
Bingo takes up her statue pose in the back yard. Bandit walks up to her. Bluey follows behind him.
Bandit: "Hey. How did you get out here?"
Bluey giggles.
Bandit: "There's definitely something weird going on—"
Bingo blows a raspberry at Bandit, and then resumes her statue pose.
Bandit: "What? Grrrrr! This is a magic statue! I knew it!"
The girls laugh.
Bandit: "You sold me magic statues!"
Bandit chases Bluey out of frame.
Bandit: (off screen) "You get back here!"
Bluey: (off screen) "Run, Bingo!"
Bingo runs away.
Bingo: "Brrrr! Brrrr! Brrrr!"
In the side yard, she notices a small tree and stops running.
Bingo: "Huh?"
She looks closer. Perched on a twig, one of the leaves has legs. Super Happy Funtime by Regurgitator begins to play.
Bingo: "Is that a leaf?"
The scene cuts to a bug's eye view of Bingo. She looms over the leaf insect as she looks at it from different angles.
Bingo: "Are you a leaf?"
The scene cuts back to the regular viewpoint.
Bingo: "You look like a leaf."
The leaf insect hops on to Bingo's nose.
Bingo: (whispering) "But you're walking. Are you a walking leaf? But, I don't understand. Why would a leaf want to walk? You should be in a tree, leaf."
Bingo: (whispering) "Daddy, come and see."
The scene cuts back to the bug's eye view.
Bingo: (whispering) "Where are you going, walking leaf? Come here, Daddy! Quickly!"
The scene cuts to Bandit. He has picked Bluey up by the feet, and is shaking her from side to side.
Bandit: "Give me back my dollary-doos!"
The scene cuts back to Bingo.
Bingo: (whispering) "Daddy, come and see!"
The insect flies away.
Bingo: "Uh! Goodbye. Have fun. I'll miss you."
The scene cuts back to Bandit and Bluey. Chilli enters from screen right.
Bluey: "Mum!"
Chilli kneels down and claps her hands.
Chilli: "Where's my Bluey?"
Bandit lets Bluey down, and she runs to Chilli. Bandit grabs her by the scruff of the neck, stopping her short. She struggles.
Bandit: "Well, go on. Give your mum a hug. What are you waiting for?"
Chilli: "Oh, Dad."
He lets go of Bluey, who runs to Chilli and hugs her.
Bandit: "Ohhh... Sorry.
Chilli: "Where's your sister?"
Bluey: "There she is."
Over by the fence, Bingo is waving good-bye to the walking leaf.
The music begins to play again, as the rest of the evening plays out through a montage.
The scene cuts to a flock of rainbow lorikeets chattering in the treetops.
The scene cuts to the family in the kitchen. Bingo is watching something on a tablet, and Bluey watches over her shoulder. Chilli chops carrots and says something. Bandit nods in agreement.
The scene cuts to the backthroom. Bingo and Bluey are in the bath. Bandit sits next to the bathtub; Bluey shampoos his hair and talks. Bingo pours water out of a cup.
In the bathroom mirror, the reflection of the girls brush their teeth with electric toothbrushes.
In the play room, Bandit lies down on the floor with a groan.
In Bluey's bedroom, Chilli tucks Bluey into bed.
Bluey: "Is there more weekend tomorrow?"
Chilli taps Bluey on the nose.
Chilli: "There sure is."
Bluey: "Hooray!"
Bluey closes her eyes, and Chilli walks out.
Chilli walks into Bingo's bedroom. She approaches Bingo's bed.
Chilli: "Already tucked in, you little star."
Bingo sniffs.
Chilli: "Aw... What's up?"
In the playroom, Bandit lays on the floor, groaning.
Bandit: "Huaaaaaaaah."
Chilli: (off screen) "Psst. Honey. Come up here.
Bandit: "Yep. Coming."
In Bingo's bedroom, Bluey has joined Chilli by Bingo's bedside. She's showing Bingo a doll.
Bluey: "Ooh, and she's got sushi shoes, and there's rice at the bottom to help the shoes stand up"
The doll, which does not actually have sushi shoes, promptly falls over with a squeak. Bandit enters, and takes Chilli's place by her bedside.
Bandit: "Hey, Bingo."
Bingo: "Daddy, you didn't come and see the walking leaf."
Bandit: "Aww, I'm sorry! I didn't hear you."
Bingo: (sadly) "That's okay."
Bandit: "The thing is — I don't know if you know this — but I bought this statue today, from a shop. And it turned out to be magic."
Bluey: "Yeah! Every time he would put it somewhere, it would just keep running away."
Bandit: "Yeah, and then I went to see the shopkeeper, and tried to get my money back, but she kept running away."
Bluey: "And he chased me all around the yard. I kept running away."
Bluey laughs.
Bandit: "Yeah, and I didn't even get my four hundred dollary-doos back. So I'm sorry."
Bingo: "Daddy."
Bingo motions for Bandit to get closer. He leans in.
Bandit: "Yeah?"
Bingo: "It was me!"
Bandit: "What."
Bingo: "I was the statue!"
Bandit: "What?!"
Bingo laughs.
Bandit: "You know what? I did think you looked a little bit familiar."
Bingo laughs again. She waves good-night to her family.
Bingo: "'Night."
Bandit: "'Night, Bingo."
Bluey: "Night-night, Bingo."
Bluey and Bingo walk to the door. Chilli, waiting at the entrance, takes Bluey's hand and escorts her out.
Bingo: (whispering) "Daddy."
Bandit stops by the door.
Bandit: "Yes, mate?"
Bingo: "Just leaves the door open this much."
Bingo holds her hands about 30 centimetres apart.
Bingo: "So the leaf can come in."
Bandit: "No worries, kiddo."
Bandit closes the door, leaving it open a crack. The room darkens, and on the walls and ceiling, glow-in-the-dark stars begin to shine. Bingo closes her eyes.
Super Happy Funtime plays over the credits. Unlike the main series, the credits are displayed over a flat blue field, and no additional animation is played.
