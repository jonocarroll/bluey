--- (The episode starts at the Glasshouse Primary School with Rusty, Jack, Bluey, and Coco playing on a boat.) ---
Rusty: OK, we finished discovering Antarctica.
Rusty: (GRUNTS) Time to sail back to Australia.
(OTHERS GIGGLE)
Jack: Captain, can I still be the sailor that scrubs the deck?
Rusty: Yep.
Rusty: Listen up, sailors, this will be a long and dangerous journey.
ALL: Ooh!
Rusty: But as long as we don't give up we'll make it back to Australia.
ALL: Hooray!
Rusty: Now, who...
Rusty's Mum: Rusty, honey, time to go!
Rusty: Oh! My mum's here. Bye!
Bluey: Eh, what?! How will we get back to Australia?
Rusty: Oh. Uh... Jack's captain now.
Jack: What? Why me?
Rusty: You're standing the closest.
Jack: But I don't know how to get to Australia.
Rusty: Just sail that way for six weeks! And don't give up!
Bluey: Six weeks?!
Jack: Oh. I think my dad will be here before then.
--- (The scene then changes to Jack's Dad and Lulu on the road, on their way to Jack's school) ---
Jack's Dad: (Singing) Picking up. Picking up Jack. Picking up Jack from school. We're picking, yeah We're picking up Jack from school Ooh, ooh...
Lulu: Dad? Why is there a sign for kangaroos, but we never see any?
Jack's Dad: I don't know, honey. They must be around here somewhere.
SATNAV: Turn left here.
Lulu: Thanks, satnav!
Jack's Dad: Lulu, what would we do without satnav?
SATNAV: In 100 metres turn... (DEAD)
Jack's Dad: Hey, what? Turn where? Turn where?!
Jack's Dad: Oh, no.
Lulu: What is it?
Jack's Dad: My phone's out of battery. We've got no satnav!
Lulu: Oh, dear.
Jack's Dad: This is bad. I don't know the way to Jack's school.
Lulu: Why not?
Jack's Dad: Well, I've only been there twice, and I just put on satnav and zone out.
Jack's Dad: Oh, man. I don't know how we're going to find Jack!
Lulu: Oh, dear.

Jack: This episode of Bluey is called EXPLORERS.
---
Bluey: What do we do, Captain?
Jack: Um... Bluey, maybe you can do something with the sails?
Jack: And, um...Coco, can you steer us... somewhere?
Coco: Which way?
Jack: Just keep going the way Rusty pointed, I suppose.
Jack: And watch out for coral reefs.
Coco: OK!
(CAR BEEPS)
Bella (Coco's Mum): Coco! Time to go!
Coco: Oh, my mum's here. Uh...
Coco: BOOM!!!
Bluey and Jack: Whoa!
Coco: We hit a coral reef!
Coco: Oh, no! I fell overboard! Argh!
Coco: I hope you get to Australia! Don't give up!
Jack: Oh, this isn't good.

Jack's Dad: Oh, this isn't good.
Jack's Dad: Ooh! I'll ask these guys.
Lulu: Ooh! Strawberries!
Jack's Dad: Hi!
Worker 1: Hola!
Jack's Dad: I'm trying to find my son's school.
Worker 1: You don't know where your son's school is?
Lulu: It's because he just puts satnav on and zones out.
Jack's Dad: Yeah, well, I'm not from around here, so...
Worker 1: Neither are we. I'm from Argentina.

Maynard: No.
Jack's Dad: Great. Do you have a phone charger?
Maynard: I don't have a phone.
Jack's Dad: What? Why not?
Maynard: Oh, I had one, but people just kept ringing it.
Jack's Dad: Oh, man. I'm looking for my son's school.
Maynard: You don't know the way to your son's school?!
Lulu: He just puts satnav on and...
Jack's Dad: Lulu. It's the Glasshouse Primary School.
Maynard: Oh, you're a long way from THAT.
Jack's Dad: Oh, man!
Maynard: I could draw you a map if you want.
Jack's Dad: Oh, yes! A map!
Maynard: It'll cost you, though.
Jack's Dad: Oh. Uh... How much?
Maynard: One of those strawberries.
Lulu: (GIGGLES)
Maynard: OK, so you just keep following that road and you're there. Whoo!
Jack's Dad: Great. How long will that take?
Maynard: Ah, ages.
Jack's Dad: Oh, man! Isn't there a quicker way?
Maynard: Well, there IS a shortcut, but...
Jack's Dad: But what?
Maynard: Well, it's a bit of a bush road, and you look like a bit of a...
Jack's Dad: Go on.
Maynard: ...a city fella.
Jack's Dad: Look, mate, just show me the shortcut.
Maynard: OK! There's an old dirt road just here.
Lulu: Dad doesn't like the car to get dirty.
Jack's Dad: Lulu!
Maynard: Oh, you're going to get dirty.
--- (At the boat) ---
Jack: No... more... supplies.
Jack: And I've got no idea if we're heading in the right direction.
Jack: And the deck could use a good scrub.
--- (Jack's Dad and Lulu arives at the shortcut) ---
Jack's Dad: Oh, here it is. This is the shortcut.
Lulu: What does the sign say?
Jack's Dad: It says the road is only for cars that are four-wheel drives.
Lulu: Is our car a four-wheel drives?
Jack's Dad: No. It's an all-wheel drives.
Lulu: Oh. How many wheels have we got?
Jack's Dad: Four.... Lulu, hold onto your strawberries.
Lulu: Agh!
Jack's Dad: We're coming, Jack!
