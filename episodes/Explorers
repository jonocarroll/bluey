The episode starts at the Glasshouse Primary School.Rusty, Jack, Bluey, and Coco are playing on a boat.
Rusty: OK, we finished discovering Antarctica. (grunting) Time to sail back to Australia.
The others giggle.
Jack: Captain, can I still be the sailor that scrubs the deck?
Rusty: Yep. (addressing the others) Listen up, sailors: this will be a long and dangerous journey.
All: Ooh!
Rusty: But as long as we don't give up, we'll make it back to Australia.
All: Hooray!
Rusty: Now, who...
Rusty's Mum: Rusty, honey, time to go!
Rusty: Oh! My mum's here. Bye!
He starts to exit the boat.
Bluey: Eh, what?! How will we get back to Australia?
Rusty: Oh. Uh... Jack's captain now.
Jack: What? Why me?
Rusty: You're standing the closest.
Jack: But I don't know how to get to Australia.
Rusty: Just sail that way for six weeks! And don't give up!
Bluey: Six weeks?!
Jack: Oh. I think my dad will be here before then.
The scene then changes to Jack's Dad and Lulu on the road, on their way to Jack's school.
Jack's Dad: (singing) ♫ Picking up, picking up Jack, picking up Jack from school. We're picking, yeah We're picking up Jack from school. Ooh, ooh... ♫
They pass by a sign that alerts drivers to watch out for kangaroos.
Lulu: Dad? Why is there a sign for kangaroos, but we never see any?
Jack's Dad: I don't know, honey. They must be around here somewhere.
Sat Nav: Turn left here.
Lulu: Thanks, satnav!
Jack's Dad: Lulu, what would we do without satnav?
Satnav: In 100 metres, turn...
Suddenly, Satnav goes dead, its battery running out.
Jack's Dad: Hey, what? Turn where? Turn where?! Oh, no...
Lulu: What is it?
Jack's Dad: My phone's out of battery. We've got no satnav!
Lulu: Oh, dear.
Jack's Dad: This is bad. I don't know the way to Jack's school.
Lulu: Why not?
Jack's Dad: Well, I've only been there twice, and I just put on satnav and zone out. Oh, man. I don't know how we're going to find Jack!
Lulu: Oh, dear.
TITLE CARD: EXPLORERS
Jack: This episode of Bluey is called, "Explorers".
Meanwhile, back at the boat...
Bluey: What do we do, Captain?
Jack: Um... Bluey, maybe you can do something with the sails? And, um... Coco, can you steer us... somewhere?
Coco: Which way?
Jack: Just keep going the way Rusty pointed, I suppose. And watch out for coral reefs.
Coco: OK!
A car beeps.It's not Jack's father, but...
Bella: Coco! Time to go!
Coco: Oh, my mum's here. Uh...
She mimicks the boat crashing into some coral reefs!
Coco: BOOM!!!
Bluey and Jack: Whoa!
Coco: We hit a coral reef! Oh, no! I fell overboard! Argh!
She exits the boat, "falling overboard."
Coco: I hope you get to Australia! Don't give up!
Jack: Oh, this isn't good.
Meanwhile, his dad echoes his son's feelings -
Jack's Dad: Oh, this isn't good.
The Russells approach a strawberry farm, headed by two workers.
Jack's Dad: Ooh! I'll ask these guys.
Lulu: Ooh! Strawberries!
Her Dad pulls up to the workers.
Jack's Dad: Hi!
Worker 1: Hola!
Jack's Dad: I'm trying to find my son's school.
Worker 1: You don't know where your son's school is?
Lulu: It's because he just puts satnav on and zones out.
Jack's Dad: Yeah, well, I'm not from around here, so...
Worker 1: Neither are we. I'm from Argentina.
OriginalDisney (Until 2023)
Worker 2: And I'm from France.
Worker 2: We're backpackers.
Jack's Dad: Righty-o. Well, can I borrow your phone?
Worker 1: Oh, yeah. Here.
He hands Jack's Dad his phone-
Jack's Dad: Ah! Thank you.
Worker 1: But there's no reception.
Jack's Dad: Oh, man.
Worker 1: Would you like a strawberry?
Lulu: Yes, please!
Meanwhile, Jack patches up the damage from earlier.
Jack: There! All fixed.
Bluey: Well done, Captain!
Jack: We're flushed all out of supplies. But as long as you stay with me, we can...
Bluey can't stay with him for longer. A stray octopus arrives!
Stray Octopus: Bl-bl-bl-bl! Bl-bl-bl-bl!
Bluey: (SCREAMS)
Jack: Oh, no!
Bluey: A giant octopus has got me!
Bandit: Bl-bl-bl-bl! Bl-bl-bl-bl!
Jack: No!
Bluey is dragged away!
Bluey: It's up to you, Jack! Don't give up!
Jack sighs, saddened his last crewmate has left. The octopus returns momentarily to grab Bluey's bag.
Bandit: Bl-bl-bl.
Jack's Dad has already departed from the strawberry field, now with a pack of strawberries.
Jack's Dad: Well, that was a waste of time.
Lulu: No, it wasn't.
Jack's Dad finds a service station-
Jack's Dad: Oh! Yes! Here we go!
-And pulls up. He approaches a familiar face.
Jack's Dad: Hi. You're not from Argentina, are you?
Maynard: No.
Jack's Dad: Great. Do you have a phone charger?
Maynard: I don't have a phone.
Jack's Dad: What? Why not?
Maynard: Oh, I had one, but people just kept ringing it.
Jack's Dad: Oh, man. I'm looking for my son's school.
Maynard: You don't know the way to your son's school?!
Lulu: He just puts satnav on and...
Jack's Dad: (side-eye) Lulu. (addressing Maynard) It's the Glasshouse Primary School.
Maynard: Oh, you're a long way from THAT.
Jack's Dad: Oh, man!
Maynard: I could draw you a map if you want.
Jack's Dad: Oh, yes! A map!
Maynard: It'll cost you, though.
Jack's Dad: Oh. Uh... How much?
Maynard points towards the pack of strawberries.
Maynard: One of those strawberries.
Lulu: (giggles)
One strawberry transaction later and Maynard has drawn a map.
Maynard: OK, so you just keep following that road and you're there. Whoo!
Jack's Dad: Great. How long will that take?
Maynard: Ah, ages.
Jack's Dad: Oh, man! Isn't there a quicker way?
Maynard: Well, there IS a shortcut, but...
Jack's Dad: But what?
Maynard: Well, it's a bit of a bush road, and you look like a bit of a...
Jack's Dad: (just absolutely out of it now) Go on.
Maynard: ...a city fella.
Jack's Dad: (out of patience) Look, mate, just show me the shortcut.
Maynard: OK! There's an old dirt road just here.
Lulu: Dad doesn't like the car to get dirty.
Jack's Dad: Lulu!
Maynard: Oh, you're going to get dirty.
Back at the boat, Jack is stranded. Alone. Out of rations.
Jack: No... more... supplies. And I've got no idea if we're heading in the right direction. And the deck could use a good scrub.
Jack's Dad and Lulu arives at the shortcut.
Jack's Dad: Oh, here it is. This is the shortcut.
Lulu points out a sign.
Lulu: What does the sign say?
Jack's Dad: It says the road is only for cars that are four-wheel drives.
Lulu: Is our car a four-wheel drives?
Jack's Dad: No. It's an all-wheel drives.
Lulu: Oh. How many wheels have we got?
Jack's Dad: Four... Lulu, hold onto your strawberries.
With some metaphorical Eurobeat blasting, Jack's Dad puts the pedal to the metal and full-sends his 4x4 through the dirt road!
Lulu: Agh!
Jack's Dad: WE'RE COMIN', JACK!
His dad may be having fun now, but Jack, not so much.
Jack: (WEAKLY) Day 102. All crew gone. No sign of land. Supplies have run out. We're not going to make it.
Calypso calls out for Jack.
Calypso: Are you right, Jack?!
Jack: (giving her a thumbs-up) Yes, Calypso!
Meanwhile, Jack's Dad and Lulu continue to full-send down the dirt road. Lulu giggles - this is the ride of a lifetime!
Jack's Dad: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! (indistinct, laughs) Whoo! We've got this, Lulu! (laughs once more!)
They finish the first leg of the run.
Jack's Dad: Whoa!
Lulu points out some flying...
Lulu: Cockatoo!
Jack's Dad: Yeah!
He giggles once more as they continue the run!
Jack's Dad: We're coming, Jack! Whoo! (GIGGLES)
Finally, land! Lulu points out a pair of 'roos in the grass!
Lulu: Dad, look! Kangaroos!
Jack's Dad: Whoo! (GIGGLES)
They continue their way through!
Jack: Huh? Cocka...toos?
Jack is reinvigorated - HE'S IN AUSTRALIA!
Jack: Cockatoos. Cockatoos!
The car is dirty now. There is no turning back now.
Jack's Dad: Come on! Come on!
Lulu: The car is definitely getting dirty!
They finally exit the shortcut!
Jack's Dad: Whoo! Ha! How good was that?!
Lulu: Yeah!
Jack's Dad: (LAUGHS)
Lulu: But the map has strawberry jam on it.
Jack's Dad: That's OK, sweetie. We don't need it anymore.
They're finally overlooking the Glasshouse School. Back at the boat, Jack finally finds land.
Jack: BOOM!!! (GRUNTS) LAND!!! (GROANS) Oh...argh...ugh. I didn't give up.
He is approached by a pair of explorers.
Jack's Dad: Well done, mate.
Jack: Is this... Australia?
Jack's Dad: Yeah, mate, this is Australia.
And the credits roll.
