Script
The episode opens with the Heelers' playroom, which is in a gigantic mess. There are toys on the floor, some are misplaced. There are also toys on the verandah and some are stuck on the shrubbery nearby. Bluey and Bingo are drawing on the floor and Chilli walks in holding a plant.
Chilli: Alright, kids. Time to tidy up.
Kids: Oh, Mum!
Bluey: We don't like tidying!
Chilli: There's no way around it, I'm afraid!
The kids groan. Bluey suddenly has an idea.
Bluey: Hey, Bingo. Let's get Daddy Robot to do it!
Bingo: Yeah!
The kids run off to find Daddy Robot.
TITLE CARD: DADDY ROBOT
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called, "Daddy Robot"!
END TITLE CARD
Scene goes to the kitchen, where Bandit is munching on leftover takeaway near the fridge. The kids walk in.
Bluey: Hey! Daddy Robot!
Bandit: (quickly eats a few more spoons, puts back container in the fridge, and shuts it. From this point on he will act and speak like a robot.) (beeps) Yes, master. (beeps) 
The kids giggle.
Bluey: We need you to do something. Come with us to the playroom.
The kids show the direction there.
Bandit: (beeps) Yes, master!
The kids stop as they're reminded of something
Bluey: Wait! Actually, carry us to the playroom!
Bandit: Yes, master! (mimicking machine whirrs as he carries them both)
Bingo: We have to robot boogie there. (presses a "button" on his belly)
Bandit: (beeps) Yes, master! (dances towards the playroom as the kids giggle)
The three reach the playroom.
Bluey: Daddy Robot, we order you to tidy up the playroom.
Bandit: (beeps) To serve my masters is my highest honor.
The kids giggle as he begins cleaning the room. Machine beeps can be heard as he does it.
Bluey: It's working!
The kids sit on a small couch in the room
Bluey: Ah!
Bingo: Ah, so relaxing!
Bluey: Yeah, this is how we always do it.
Bingo: Yeah.
Bluey: Actually, Daddy Robot, we never want to tidy the playroom ever again!
Bingo: Yeah. Ever again!
Bandit: Never again? 
Bluey: Never again! Ever. At all. You understand?
Bandit: Yes, master. (drops items in his hand, beeps and shakes) Recalculating objectives. (marches behind the kids' couch and lifts it. Bingo realizes this and her sister follows)
Kids: Ah! What are you doing, Daddy Robo-o-ot? (gets shaken)
Bandit: Following masters' orders. (beeps)
Bluey: Aaah! Put us down!
Bingo: (giggles) I love Daddy Robot!
Bluey: (angry) Where are you taking us!?
Bandit: (beeps) To the wheely bin.
Bluey: What?! Why?!
Bandit: You two are the reason playroom is always untidy. If I throw you in wheely bin, playroom will always be tidy. And then you will never have to tidy playroom ever again.
Kids: What?!
Bandit: It's a solid plan, master!
The kids scream in horror as the scene goes to the living room. Chilli is spraying her plant.
Bluey: Mum! Daddy Robot is gonna throw us in the wheely bin!
Chilli: Oh no!
Bluey: Quick, Mum, we need the sprayer!
Chilli: (throws her the sprayer) Catch!
Bluey catches it as Daddy Robot beeps. She then sprays Daddy Robot with it. Just after that he begins acting funny.
Bandit: Syntax error! (puts couch down on floor, the kids leave it. He then beeps again) Please press "play" on tape. 
Chilli: He's malfunctioning!
Daddy Robot beeps, then begins to dance
Chilli: Why was Daddy Robot throwing you in the wheely bin?!
Bluey: Oh, um... Well...
Bandit: (stops dancing) Must tidy up! (beeps) Come here, vacuum cleaner! (picks up Bluey)
Bluey: Aaah! (used as a vacuum cleaner) I'm not a vacuum cleaner!
Bingo: Yeah, Daddy Robot! She's not a vacuum cleaner!
Bandit: Oh yes! (beeps) My mistake! (holds Bluey upside down) This is not a vacuum cleaner!
Bluey: I told you!
Bandit: It's a banjo!
Bluey: What?!! (laughs as Daddy Robot "plays" her, tickling her belly.)
Bingo: Hey, that's my sister! Not a banjo!
Bandit: (puts Bluey down, beeps) What are you doing out of the laundry basket? (points at Bingo)
Bingo: Laundry basket?!
Bandit: Yes! You are laundry. I folded you this morning. Come here!
Bingo screams as she tries to run away. Bandit picks her up as she giggles and brings her to the laundry room. He places her in the basket and folds her.
Bandit: Fold! Fold! Fold! Fold! Fold!
Bingo: (giggles) I'm not laundry!
Bluey: (runs in) She's not laundry!
Bandit: Oh no, a guinea pig has escaped.
Bluey: What?!
Scene returns to the living room, Chilli is spraying another plant and Bluey runs in, screaming in terror.
Bluey: Mum, Daddy Robot thinks I'm a guinea pig! What should I do?!
Bandit: (dances towards Bluey, chasing her.) Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Come back here, guinea pig!
Chilli: You have to push his nose to turn him off!
Bingo: But how?! (runs in with laundry basket and hides inside it)
Bluey: (runs back to Bingo) I know, I've got an idea!
Daddy Robot enters the sunroom, appearing to end his dancing with style. Bluey walks in.
Bluey: Look, Daddy Robot!
Daddy Robot is suddenly startled.
Bluey: It's a Mummy Robot!
Chilli, acting as "Mummy Robot" walks in. She will speak like a robot and acts like so for a while.
Chilli: (beeps) Hello!
Bandit: Cheese and crackers, you're the most beautiful robot I've ever seen!
Chilli: (beeps) You are too kind.
Bandit: My name is Daddy Robo- (suddenly does a step dance. Then he suddenly stops.)
Crickets can be heard in the background as other music stops.
Chilli: That was a little odd.
Meanwhile the kids get themselves prepared on a couch behind them.
Bandit: Please pretend I didn't just do that.
Chilli: It is hard to unsee something like that.
Bandit: Even so...
The kids jump on Daddy Robot and puts him to the ground. 
Bandit: Off me, furry creatures!
Chilli: (normally) Alright now, turn him off!
Bluey: Touch his nose, touch his nose!
Bingo can't reach for his nose, but Bluey manages to shut him down before things get harder.
Bandit: Powering... down...
Chilli: Ah... (Gets near Daddy Robot)
Bandit: Cursed... to depart... having only just... known... your beauty.
Chilli: Oh...
Bandit makes one last whirr before finally shutting down. The kids look at him sadly.
Bingo: Poor Daddy Robot.
A brief silence. Suddenly Daddy Robot lets loose a huge fart, much to Chilli's disgust and the kids' amusement. The scene cuts to inside the playroom, otherwise a makeshift garage lit with a table lamp, where Daddy Robot is being repaired.
Chilli: Screwdriver.
Bingo: Screwdriver. (hands her mum a crayon) Please fix him.
Chilli uses the "screwdriver" on Daddy Robot, tickling him along the way.
Chilli: I'll try my best. These circuits are badly damaged. 
Bingo: Aww...
Chilli: It's strange though. Daddy Robots don't usually go crazy like that.
Bluey: Well, actually. It's our fault.
Bingo: We ordered Daddy Robot to tidy the playroom for us.
Chilli: And that's when he tried to throw you in the wheely bin?
Bingo: Yeah.
Chilli: Oh. I see. Okay. (to the kids) I'll tell you the secret. Daddy Robots will find the easiest way to do a job.
Kids: Oh.
Chilli: Just... like... kids! (tickles Bingo)
Scene cuts to black. Bingo can be heard, echoing.
Bingo: I hope he's okay.
The scene turns out to be the first person view of Daddy Robot, opening his eyes and sees Bluey and Bingo.
Bluey: Hello, Daddy Robot!
Bingo: How are you feeling?
Bandit: (beeps) I dreamt... I met a robot angel. (buzzes) Hello, master. What are my orders? (beeps)
Bluey: (shows direction) Follow us.
The scene returns to the playroom mess, with Bluey guiding Daddy Robot who is beeping along the way to a couple of small couches.
Bluey: Now, sit down.
Bandit: (sits down) Yes, master?
Bingo: Now, lie back.
Bandit: (lies back) Are you sure, master? (stands up) Should I tidy something up for you?
Bluey pushes Daddy Robot back
Kids: No.
Bluey: We order you to relax, Daddy Robot.
Daddy Robot sits back down on the couch and happily gets in a relaxed position. Bingo giggles and runs off
Bandit: I've never relaxed before. Is this right? 
Bluey: Usually, you close your eyes.
Daddy Robot procedurally closes his eyes. Bluey turns back and beckons.
Bluey: Look who's here!
Bingo returns with Mum, once again acting as "Mummy Robot"
Chilli: Hello again!
Daddy Robot, upon hearing her, wakes up surprised. Mummy Robot beeps and does a pose.
Bandit: Cheese and crackers...
Mummy Robot beeps as she makes her way to the other couch.
Bingo: You robots relax We're gonna tidy the playroom.
Bluey: Come on, Bingo.
Kids: Bye, robots!
The camera switches to behind the robots. Bluey and Bingo pick up their toys.
Bandit: This... Feels like... A robo-dream.
Chilli: Well, kiss me before you wake up.
The two share a kiss with the setting sun as background. Meanwhile the kids witness this romantic scene and let out a big "Ooh!"
