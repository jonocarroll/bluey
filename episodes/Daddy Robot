The episode opens with Bluey and Bingo lying on the floor and drawing in the Heelers' playroom, which is a gigantic mess. There are toys all over the floor, the verandah, and even in the nearby shrubbery. Chilli walks in, holding a potted plant.
Chilli: "Alright, kids, time to tidy up."
Bluey, Bingo: "Aw, Mum!"
Bluey: "We don't like tidying."
Chilli: "There's no way around it, I'm afraid."
Bluey and Bingo groan. As Chilli walks off, Bluey has an idea.
Bluey: "Hey, Bingo. Let's get Daddy Robot to do it!"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bluey and Bingo run off from their playroom to find Bandit.
TITLE CARD - Daddy Robot
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called: Daddy Robot!"
In the kitchen, Bandit is munching on leftover takeaway in front of the fridge. Bluey and Bingo walk in.
Bluey: "Hey, Daddy Robot!"
Bandit quickly eats a few more spoonfuls, before putting the container back in the fridge, shutting it, and beginning to act like a robot.
Bandit: (beeps in robotic voice) "Yes, Master." (beeps)
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bluey: "We need you to do something. Come with us to the playroom."
Bluey and Bingo show the direction there.
Bandit: (beeps) "Yes, Master."
Suddenly, Bluey realises as she changes her mind.
Bluey: "Wait. Actually, carry us to the playroom!"
Bandit: "Yes, Master."
Bandit mimics machine noises as he picks them both up.
Bingo: "We have to robo-boogie there."
Bandit: (beeps) "Yes, Master."
Bandit dances towards the playroom as the kids giggle. They reach the playroom, and Bandit stops.
Bluey: "Daddy Robot, we order you to tidy up the playroom."
Bandit: (beeps) "To serve my masters is the highest honour."
Bluey and Bingo giggle as Bandit begins cleaning the playroom.
Bluey: "It's working!"
Bluey and Bingo sit on a small couch in the playroom.
Bluey: "Ahh!"
Bingo: "Ahh, so relaxing!"
Bluey: "Yeah, this is how we should always do it."
Bingo: "Yeah."
Bluey: "Actually, Daddy Robot, we never want to tidy the playroom ever again!"
Bingo: "Yeah. Ever again!"
Bandit: "Never again?"
Bluey: "Never again! Ever. At all. You understand?"
Bandit: "Yes, Master."
Bandit drops items in his hand, beeps, and shakes.
Bandit: "Recalculating objectives."
Bandit walks behind the kids' couch and lifts it, shaking it as he does.
Bluey, Bingo: "Aah! What are you doing, Daddy Robo-o-ot?"
Bandit: "Following Master's orders." (beeps)
Bluey: "Aah! Put us down!"
Bingo: (giggles) "I love Daddy Robot!"
Bandit exits the playroom, carrying the couch. through the hallway.
Bluey: "Where are you taking us?!"
Bandit: (beeps) "To the wheelie bin."
Bluey: "What?! Why?!"
Bandit: "You two are the reason playroom is always untidy. If I throw you in wheely bin, playroom will always be tidy. And then you will never have to tidy playroom ever again."
Bluey, Bingo: "What?!"
Bandit: "It's a solid plan, Master."
Bluey and Bingo scream in horror as they're carried to the living room, where Chilli is spraying her plant.
Bluey: "Mum! Daddy Robot is going to throw us in the wheelie bin!"
Chilli: "Oh no!"
Bluey: "Quick, Mum, we need the sprayer!"
Chilli: "Catch!"
Chilli throws the sprayer, which Bluey catches and uses to spray Bandit, making him 'malfunction' and act in 'strange ways'.
Bandit: (various beeps) "Syntax error. (buzzes) Please press 'play' on tape." (more beeps)
Chilli: "He's malfunctioning!"
Bandit beeps, then begins to beatbox and dance.
Chilli: "Why was Daddy Robot throwing you in the wheely bin?!"
Bluey: "Oh, um... well..."
Bandit: "Must tidy up. (beeps and boops) Come here, vacuum cleaner."
Bandit picks up Bluey and uses her as a vacuum cleaner.
Bluey: "Aaah! I'm not a vacuum cleaner!"
Bingo: "Yeah, Daddy Robot! She's not a vacuum cleaner!"
Bandit holds Bluey upside-down.
Bandit: "Oh yes. (beeps) My mistake. This is not a vacuum cleaner."
Bluey: "I told you!"
Bandit: "It's a banjo."
Bluey: "What?!"
Bandit begins to play Bluey like a banjo, vocalising banjo sounds as Bluey laughs from being tickled.
Bingo: "Hey, that's my sister! Not a banjo!"
Bandit puts Bluey down and points to Bingo.
Bandit: (beeps) "What are you doing out of the laundry basket?"
Bingo: "Laundry basket?!"
Bandit: "Yes. You are laundry. I folded you this morning. Come here."
Bingo screams as she tries to run away. Bandit picks her up as she giggles and brings her to the laundry room. He places her in the basket and folds her limbs.
Bandit: "Fold, fold, fold, fold, fold!"
Bingo: (giggles) "I'm not laundry!"
Bluey runs in the laundry room.
Bluey: "She's not laundry!"
Bandit turns to Bluey.
Bandit: "Oh no. A guinea pig has escaped."
Bluey: "What?!"
Back in the living room, Chilli is spraying another plant when Bluey runs in, screaming in terror.
Bluey: "Mum, Daddy Robot thinks I'm a guinea pig! What should I do?!"
Bandit enters, squat dancing after Bluey in the living room.
Bandit: "Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Come back here, guinea pig."
Chilli: "You have to push his nose to turn him off!"
Bingo runs in with a laundry basket and hides under it.
Bingo: "But how?!"
Bluey: "I know, I've got an idea!"
Bandit enters the sunroom, dancing with style. Bluey follows him.
Bluey: "Look, Daddy Robot!"
Bandit buzzes and Chilli enters the room, acting as 'Mummy Robot.'
Bluey: "It's a Mummy Robot!"
Chilli: (beeps) "Hello."
Bandit: (beeps) "Cheese and crackers, you're the most beautiful robot I've ever seen!"
Chilli: (beeps) "You are too kind."
Bandit: "My name is Daddy Rob-"
Bandit suddenly breaks into an Irish stepdance, complete with music. The music and his dancing suddenly stops.
Chilli: "That was a little odd."
Meanwhile, Bluey and Bingo get prepared on a couch behind their parents.
Bandit: "Please pretend I didn't just do that."
Chilli: "It is hard to unsee something like that."
Bandit: "Even so..."
Suddenly, Bluey and Bingo jump on Bandit and pin him to the ground.
Bandit: "Off me, furry creatures!"
Chilli stops acting as Mummy Robot.
Chilli: "Alright now, turn him off!"
Bluey: "Touch his nose, touch his nose!"
Bluey manages touch Bandit's nose, making him freeze and power down.
Bandit: "Powering down..."
Chilli gasps and hurries to Bandit's side.
Bandit: "Cursed... to depart... having only just... known... your beauty..."
Chilli: "Aw..."
Bandit makes one last whir before finally shutting down. Bluey and Bingo look at him sadly.
Bingo: "Poor Daddy Robot."
A brief silence. Suddenly, Bandit lets loose a huge fart, much to Chilli's disgust and the kids' amusement. The scene cuts to inside the playroom, where Chilli is repairing Bandit in a makeshift workshop lit with a table lamp.
Chilli: "Screwdriver."
Bingo hands her a crayon.
Bingo: "Screwdriver. Please fix him."
Chilli uses the 'screwdriver' on Bandit, tickling him as she does.
Chilli: "I'll try my best. These circuits are badly damaged."
Bingo: "Aww..."
Chilli: "It's strange, though. Daddy Robots don't usually go crazy like that."
Bluey: "Well, actually, it's our fault."
Bingo: "We ordered Daddy Robot to tidy the playroom for us."
Chilli: "And that's when he tried to throw you in the wheelie bin?"
Bingo: "Yeah."
Chilli: "Oh. I see. Okay. I'll tell you the secret. Daddy Robots will find the easiest way to do a job."
Bluey, Bingo: "Oh."
Chilli: "Just... like... kids!"
Chilli tickles Bingo. The scene cuts to black, where Bingo can be heard, echoing.
Bingo: "I hope he's ok."
The scene transitions to the first-person view from Bandit, who 'powers up' and opens his eyes to see Bluey and Bingo.
Bluey: "Hello, Daddy Robot!"
Bingo: "How are you feeling?"
Bandit: (beeps) "I dreamt... I met... a robot angel. (buzzes) Hello, Master. What are my orders?" (beeps)
Bluey: "Follow us."
They entered the playroom as there's an mess, Bluey guides a beeping Bandit to two small couches.
Bluey: "Now sit down."
Bandit sits on one of the couches.
Bandit: "Yes, Master?"
Bingo: "Now lie back."
Bandit lies back in the couch.
Bandit: (buzzes) "Are you sure, master?"
Bandit gets up.
Bandit: (buzzes) "Shouldn't I tidy something up for you?"
Bluey pushes Daddy Robot back.
Bluey, Bingo: "No."
Bluey: "We order you to relax, Daddy Robot."
Bandit sits back down on the couch and happily gets relaxed. Bingo giggles and runs off.
Bandit: "I've never relaxed before. Is this right?"
Bluey: "Usually, you close your eyes."
Bandit closes his eyes. Bluey turns back and beckons.
Bluey: "Look who's here!"
Bingo returns with Chilli, who is once again acting as Mummy Robot.
Chilli: (beeps) "Hello again."
Upon hearing her, Bandit wakes up, surprised. Chilli beeps and does a pose.
Bandit: "Cheese and crackers..."
Chilli beeps and buzzes as she makes her way to the other couch and sits on it.
Bingo: "You robots relax. We're gonna tidy the playroom."
Bluey: "Come on, Bingo!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Bye, robots!"
As Bluey and Bingo pick up their toys, Bandit and Chilli watch the sunset.
Bandit: "This... feels like... a robo-dream."
Chilli: "Well, kiss me before you wake up."
Bandit and Chilli share a kiss with the setting sun as a background and soaring electronic music begins to play. The scene cuts to Bluey and Bingo watching, the music fading out.
Bluey, Bingo: "Oooooh!"
The music of the credits is the episode's soundtrack of a happy electronic piece. Bluey is dancing.
