Bingo: Rrr! 
Bandit: 
Bluey: Dad, can you play with us?
Mackenzie: Yeah, can you play with us, Bluey's dad?
Bluey: We're bored.
Bandit: Bored? I thought you kids loved the playground.
Bluey: We do, but we've played on all the swings already.
Bandit: Well, play on 'em again.
Bingo: Rrr!
Bluey: Can you play with us now?
Bandit: Okay. It's just that I'm a bit big for all these swings, mate. They're for kids.
Mackenzie: What about we go to the creek, Bluey's Dad?
Bandit: Uh... yeah, I'll take you down to the creek. You squirts keen for that?
: Yay!
Bluey: I think. 
: This episode of Bluey is called The Creek. 
Bluey: Ohh! Waa! (To Mackenzie) How do you do that?
Mackenzie: Dunno. You just balance.
Bandit: Let's bush bash!
Bingo and Mackenzie: Yay!
Bluey: Uh, actually... I might just stay on the playground, if that's okay. 
Mackenzie: Come on, Bluey! The creek is beautiful!
Bluey: Maybe I should g--
Mackenzie: Come on!
Bluey: There sure are a lot of bushes. Aah! Thorns! 
Bandit: Make sure you watch out for dropbears.
Bingo: Dropbears? 
Bluey: Are you joking?
Bandit: Yeah, yeah, I'm joking. But seriously, watch out for snakes.
Bluey, worriedly: Ohhhh! 
Bluey: Aaah!
Bluey: Aaaaaaaaah! 
Bluey: 
Bluey: There sure are a lot of bugs at the creek.
 
Bluey: Aaaaaah! Tiny snake! 
Bandit: It's just a leech, kid. Yoink!
Mackenzie: Yeah, don't worry. He just wants to eat your blood. 
Bluey: Maybe we should head back. Not as many leeches in the playground. 
Bandit: Ooh, but there's not as many of ùòµùò©ùò∞ùò¥ùò¶, either. 
Bluey & Bingo: Wow!
Mackenzie: Oooh!
Bluey: The ground here is more uneven than in the playground. 
Bluey: Aaaah! Ohh!
Bandit: You all right, Bluey? 
Bluey, holding her knee: My knee! 
Bandit: Give us a look. Oh, yeah. Okay. I'll just have to chop the leg off. 
Bluey: Aaah! No! 
Bandit: What? You don't need two. 
Mackenzie: The creek! 
Bingo: Ooh! The creek is beautiful!
Bandit: There's a nicer bit just up this way. We used to play there when ùòê was a kid.
Bandit: Let's rock-hop it up. 
Bluey: Aah! Ehh... Ohh! Yeesh! some of these stones are pointy.
Mackenzie: Just take your time. And watch out for wobbly ones.
Bluey: Aah! This is a wobbly one!
Mackenzie: Yeah, that's a wobbly one.
Bluey: Ooh! Ooooooh! Aah! Blegh!
Mackenzie: And the green ones are slippery.
Bluey: I swallowed mud! What can happen?!
Bandit: Eh, it'll do you good.
 
Bluey: Oh! The creek is beautiful. It's so lovely. I'm not scared of it at all. Ooh! Heh! Whoo!
Bluey: Hey, I think i'm getting the hang of the creek.
Bandit: Good one!
Bingo: Nice job, Mackenzie!
Bandit: Ready, Bingo? 
Bingo: Yep. 
 
Bingo: Whee!
Mackenzie: Your turn, Bluey. 
Bluey: It's pretty wide! 
Bandit: Okay, on the count of three. go! 
Bluey: It's too far! 
Mackenzie: Come on, Bluey! It's just like jumping from one sheep to another. 
Bluey: We don't jump on sheep, Mackenzie.
Mackenzie: Really? 
Bandit: You'll be all right, kiddo. Just be brave.
Bluey: The creek is... beautiful! 
Bandit, Bingo, and Mackenzie: Hooray!
Bluey: I did it!
Bandit: Yeah! You made it, squirt!
Bluey: Yeah, I did.
Bandit: Here we are.
Mackenzie: Whoa! 
Bluey: Wow!
Bandit: I don't think I've been here since I was ùò∫ùò∞ùò∂ùò≥ age.
Bandit: Ah, it still looks the same.
Bluey: So, what are we supposed to play?
Bandit: Uh... dunno. It's the creek. You just sort of muck around. Ohhh, yeah! 
Bluey: Okay, but how de we --
Bingo, pointing at the water: Tadpoles! 
Bluey: Huh? 
Bingo: Look at the little fellas!
Bluey: They're nibbling my toes!
 
Bluey: Wow! So beautiful. 
Bandit: Still want to head back to the playground, kiddo?
Bluey: No, I like it here. 
Mackenzie: Whoa! 
Bluey:Woo!
Bingo: 
 
Bandit: Ahhhh. So relaxing. 
Bluey: It's good of you to join us in our new day spa. You're our very first customer.
Bandit: Oh! It's a delight! 
Mackenzie: Do you like your nails, Bluey's Dad? 
Bandit: Oh, I do. They're amazing!
Bingo: This mud pack will make you very beautiful. 
Bandit: Oh, thanks, Cassiopeia.
Cassiopeia (Bingo): There you go. Ooh! I'm out of mud. 
Bluey: Oh, I'll get some more. 
Bandit: I can feel my pores opening.
Bluey: Aha! The creek is beautiful.
Bandit: Hey, look, gang. You got the swings all to yourself. Do you want one last go before we head home? 
Bluey: No, thanks, Dad.
Mackenzie: Yeah, I'm a bit tired.
Bandit: I didn't think you ùò®ùò∞ùòµ tired, Mackenzie.
Bluey: Look! I can do it! I can do it! 
Mackenzie: Nice one, Bluey. 
Bandit: You didn't get any gazontapedes on you, did you, Bingo?
Bingo: Gazontapedes? Are you joking?
Bandit: Yeah, yeah. Gazontapedes aren't real. But seriously, we have to check for ticks.
