Bandit: Whoo, Tbone! 
Chilli: Hang on. 
Bandit: Huh? Oh.
Bluey: You ready? 
BOTH: ðŸŽµ For the golden corn and the apples on the trees, for the golden butter and the honey from the bees, for fruits and nuts and berries, they grow beside the way, we praise our loving Mother Earth and thank her everyday. Hooray! ðŸŽµ
Bandit: Well, that's new. 
Bingo: We learned it at Kindy. 
Chilli: The honey bits my favorite.
