The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler residence. The sun is going down, dusk is approaching, We cut to the dinner table, where the Heelers are having steak for dinner. Bandit is about to eat a piece of his steak with a fork.
Bandit: Whoo, tbone! 
Bluey and Bingo cross their arms over their chests.
Chilli: Hang on. 
Bandit: Huh? Oh.
Chilli and Bandit cross their arms over their chests as well.
Bluey: You ready? 
Bluey & Bingo: 🎵 For the golden corn and the apples on the trees, for the golden butter and the honey from the bees, for fruits and nuts and berries, they grow beside the way, we praise our loving Mother Earth and thank her everyday. Hooray! 🎵
The Heelers go back to eating dinner.
Bandit: Well, that's new. 
Bingo: We learned it at Kindy. 
Chilli: The honey bit's my favourite.
Bluey: Ooh! Can we play "What Was Your Favourite Thing" today?
Chilli: Okay.
Bluey & Bingo: Hooray!
The title card appears with the episode's title: Favourite Thing. Above the title is a plate of a carrot, some celery and some cherry tomatoes.
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called "Favourite Thing".
We cut back to the family table.
Chilli: You go first, Bluey.
Bluey: Well, my favourite thing was at morning tea.
A brief flashback shows Bluey and Bingo eating some vegetables for morning tea near the garden steps. Bingo is struggling to pick up a cherry tomato with her fork, but to no success.
Bluey: Bingo was trying to eat cherry tomatoes with her fork.
Bingo: Ah, this is trifficult.
We cut back to everyone laughing at the table except Bingo, who is left feeling confused and hurt.
Bluey: She said "trifficult"! It was so funny.
Bandit: Oh, Bingo. You must've been trying to say "tricky" and "difficult" at the same time.
Both Bandit and Bluey chuckle with glee. We cut to a closeup on Bingo looking down sadly, feeling hurt and upset from the others laughing at her. Chilli notices Bingo looking down and tries reassuring her.
Chilli: Oh, Bingo, honey. It's okay, it's funny.
Bingo: No, it isn't. 
Bingo leaves the table and runs away offscreen.
Bluey: Bingo! to Chilli What did I say wrong?
Chilli: Nothing, honey. Just eat your dinner. 
Chilli gets up and leaves the table to follow Bingo. Bluey turns to Bandit.
Bluey: I didn't mean to upset her.
Bandit: I know. I think she's just embarrassed she said the word wrong.
Bluey shrugs her shoulders.
Bluey: It was funny.
Bandit: Well, yeah. But I guess she thought you were laughing at her.
Bluey: But I wasn't!
Bandit: I know. Look, she'll be 'right. Just eat your dinner.
Chilli and Bingo return to their seats at the table, with Bingo still looking gloomy. Bluey tries to console Bingo.
Bluey: I'm sorry, Bingo. I didn't mean to embarrass you. 
Bingo: gloomy That's okay...
Bluey: Are you still upset with me?
Bingo: No...
Bluey: feeling bad Ohh, you are!
Chilli: encouraging Come on, let's keep playing the Favourite Things game. Whose turn is it?
Bluey: Um, actually, I think I was wrong with what my favourite thing was.
Bandit: Ah, okay. What's your new one?
Bluey: Well, it wasn't at morning tea, it was at afternoon tea.
Bandit & Chilli: both unenthused Oh, no...
We cut to a flashback that shows Bluey and Bingo eating sausages on the balcony. Bandit is trying to fix the gas tank as Chilli offers alfalfa leaves to her daughters.
Chilli: Look, kids, all I ask is that you eat some alfalfa. It'll stop you getting sick.
Bluey points to Chilli and tries acting cool.
Bluey: Okay, dude.
Chilli: And stop calling me dude.
Bluey: Sorry, dude.
Bandit briefly points his BBQ brush at Bluey.
Bandit: Bluey, can it.
Bluey: Sure thing, dude!
Bingo starts giggling.
Bandit: Bluey, I'm serious!
Bluey: What's up with these dudes?
Bingo is laughing joyfully. We back to Bluey laughing at the table. Bingo briefly smiles before becoming downcast again.
Bandit: unamused That was a fun three hours.
Bluey: Bingo, do you want to have your turn now?
Bingo shakes her head, declining Bluey's plea. Chilli sets down her utensils for a turn.
Chilli: Well, I'll have a turn.
Bluey: Wait, Mum! 
Bluey slides down her chair, hitting Bandit's foot on the way.
Bandit: Argh!
Bluey crawls under the table and stands up next to Chilli.
Bluey: Can you make sure that your favourite thing is something where Bingo does something really funny in it?
Chilli: Okay, sweetheart. 
Bluey crawls under the table back to her seat, hitting Bandit's foot again on the way.
Bandit: Argh!
Bluey: Proceed.
Chilli: Well, my favourite thing happened at lunchtime.
We cut to another flashback that shows the Heelers having lunch at an outdoor restaurant. Bingo places her paws together and turns to Chilli.
Bingo: Mum?
Chilli: Yes?
Bingo: Open the lid.
Chilli: Okay. 
She lifts Bingo's right paw.
Bingo: Stick your finger in. 
Chilli sticks her right finger in Bingo's left paw.
Chilli: curiously Oh-ho.
Bingo: Now wiggle it 'round.
Chilli: feeling unsure Err, okay. 
Chilli wiggles her finger in Bingo's left paw.
Bingo: Take it out. 
Chilli takes her finger out of Bingo's left paw.
Bingo: Now close the lid. 
Chilli closes down Bingo's right paw.
Bingo: Thank you for cleaning my toilet.
Chilli: surprised What?!! 
She wipes the dirty finger on her fur while Bandit, Bluey and Bingo laugh at her together.
Chilli: Blecch! Yuck!
We cut back to Bandit and Bluey laughing from the story at the dinner table. Bingo is now smiling.
Chilli: That was disgusting.
Bluey: Good one, Bingo. Are you ready for your turn now? 
Bingo frowns and shakes her head. Bluey grumbles with her arms crossed.
Bluey: Hmmph!
Bandit: Well, I'll tell you my least favourite thing today. 
Bandit whispers to Bingo.
Bandit: Bingo, remember this one?
Another brief flashback shows Bingo entering the toilet room, seeing Bandit on a step ladder, replacing a light bulb.
Bandit: narrating I was changing a light bulb.
Bingo: Daddy?
Bandit: Yeah, mate? 
Bingo sits on the toilet and watches Bandit.
Bingo: What's your name?
Bandit: Dad.
Bingo: And what is this? 
She points to her nose.
Bandit: Nose. 
Bingo holds out her paws.
Bingo: And what am I holding?
Bandit: Uhh... nothing! 
Bingo giggles gleefully.
Bingo: "Dad knows nothing."
Bandit: slowly realising Aw, what?!
Bingo is laughing joyfully. We cut back to Bluey, Bingo and Chilli laughing loudly at Bandit at the table. He rolls his eyes away and crosses his arms.
Chilli: Oh, you poor dad.
Bingo's joy slowly fades, down to a upset look.
Bluey: That was funny. Now that I think about it, my real favourite thing, actually, was when Bingo and I were eating morning tea.
We cut to the very first flashback where Bingo was struggling to pick up a cherry tomato with her fork.
Bluey: narrating Bingo was trying to eat cherry tomatoes with her fork.
Bingo: This is difficult.
Bingo makes an effort to catch a cherry tomato, but the strong pressure causes the tomato to fly away at an incredible speed eventually hits Bandit's forehead while carrying a dog gnome.
Bandit: Ya-oww!
Bandit falling backwards causes the gnome to fly up in the air and lands down on the grass. Looking up in the sky, a large imaginary pink hippo is seen, completely blissful and unaware as it continues plummeting down, about to land onto the gnome.
Bandit: Jeremy! No!
Chilli appears out of nowhere.
Chilli: acting dramatically Who will save Jeremy from the falling hippo?!
Bingo: I will!
Bingo imagines a jetpack on her back and rockets up in the sky to catch the heavy hippo with all her might. Chilli and Bluey applaud Bingo's heroic action.
Chilli & Bluey: Yeah!
Bingo places the hippo on the grass to keep a safe distance from Jeremy the gnome. She smiles with heroic confidence.
Chilli: Thanks, Jetpack Bingo!
Bingo gives a thumbs up. Bandit starts cradling and smooching the hippo's bottom.
Bandit: Ooh! Ooh, hippo! Mwah, mwah, mwah. I love you.
We cut back to Bluey finishing her story at the table. Bandit appears to be dumbfounded from hearing her words.
Bandit: WHAT?! 
Bingo and Chilli laugh out loud.
Bandit: I don't remember that!
Bluey: Hooray, you're happy again! 
Bingo frowns and turns away from Bluey with her arms crossed.
Bingo: No, I'm not.
Bluey growls in frustration.
Bluey: This isn't fair, Bingo! I said sorry. And I tried a hundred times to cheer you up, but you're still trying to make me even more sad.
Bingo: I can't help it.
Chilli: She's not trying to make you feel sad, Bluey.
Bingo: I'm just sad.
Bingo leaves the table and hides next to the dishwasher, wanting to be alone.
Bluey: But, Bingo...!
Chilli: Just let her go.
Bluey: But why is she still sad? I thought I fixed her!
Chilli: You can't always fix people, sweetheart. She'll come good. Just eat your dinner.
Bluey: I don't feel like eating now.
Bluey pushes her plate from her. Bandit takes Bluey's last steak piece and eats it.
Bandit: Mmm! More for me.
Chilli: Bandit! She's upset.
Bandit: Yeah, but she's easy to cheer up.
Bluey crosses her arms.
Bluey: No, I'm not!
Bandit: Yeah, you are. Dude! 
Bluey starts laughing.
Bandit: Pass me the tomato sauce, dude. 
She squeals and passes Bandit the tomato sauce.
Bluey: Don't call me dude!
Bandit: Why not, DUDE? 
Bluey squeals again. He talks to Chilli.
Bandit: Pass the salt. Thanks, DUDE.
Chilli: Don't you dude me!
Bluey's loud squeal causes Bingo to look at the family, curiously.
Bandit: Hey, dude! 
Bingo starts laughing with glee.
Bluey: Come have dinner, dude.
Bingo: Okay, dude. 
Bingo happily walks back to her seat. Bluey passes Bingo the tomato sauce.
Bluey: Here's the sauce, dude.
Bingo: Thanks, dude. 
By now, Bingo no longer feels upset as she puts some tomato sauce on her steak.
Bandit: Okay. All good.
Bingo: Is it my turn for my favourite thing that happened today?
Bandit: Yep, I think it is.
Bluey: Maybe let's not to play that game.
Chilli: Yeah, I agree.
Bandit: Yeah, we're living' in the past, dudes.
Bluey: How about it still has to be a favourite thing, but it has to be something happening right now?
Chilli: Oh, I like that.
Bandit: Yeah, live in the now, dude.
Chilli: being serious Stop calling us dude!
Bluey: Okay, go, Bingo.
Bingo: Ooh, okay. Ah... Hmm.
She tries to think of an idea for a beat.
Bingo: Umm...
Bluey: Not much happening right now.
Chilli: Yeah.
Bandit holds his glass of water and drinks it.
Bingo: This is trifficult.
Bandit suddenly coughs up the water out of his mouth and nose; he spits the water on the floor as Bluey, Bingo and Chilli laugh together at Bandit.
Bingo: That's my favourite thing!
We cut to the credits. Instead of Bluey dancing, a dog gnome with a blue cap slides in from the left.
