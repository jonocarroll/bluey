Bingo: Ah, this is trifficult.
Scene cuts back to everyone laughing at the table except Bingo, feeling confused and hurt.
Bluey: She said "trifficult"! It was so funny.
Bandit: Oh, Bingo. You must've been trying to say "tricky" and "difficult" at the same time.
Both Bandit and Bluey chuckle with glee. Closeup on Bingo looking down, feeling hurt and upset. Chilli notices Bingo and tries to reassure her.
Chilli: Oh, Bingo, honey. It's okay, it's funny.
Bingo: No, it isn't. 
Bluey: Bingo! What did I say wrong?
Chilli: Nothing, honey. Just eat your dinner. 
Bluey: I didn't mean to upset her.
Bandit: I know. I think she's just embarrassed she said the word wrong.
Bluey: It was funny.
Bandit: Well, yeah. But I guess she thought you were laughing at her.
Bluey: But I wasn't!
Bandit: I know. Look, she'll be 'right. Just eat your dinner.
Chilli and Bingo return to their seats at the table. Bluey tries to console a gloomy Bingo next to her.
Bluey: I'm sorry, Bingo. I didn't mean to embarrass you. 
Bingo: That's okay...
Bluey: Are you still upset with me?
Bingo: No...
Bluey: Ohh, you are!
Chilli: Come on, let's keep playing the Favourite Things game. Whose turn is it?
Bluey: Um, actually, I think I was wrong with what my favourite thing was.
Bandit: Ah, okay. What's your new one?
Bluey: Well, it wasn't at morning tea, it was at afternoon tea.
Bandit & Chilli: Oh, no...
A brief flashback shows Bluey and Bingo eating sausages on the balcony. Bandit is sorting the barbecue and Chilli offers alfalfa leaves to her daughters.
Chilli: Look, kids, all I ask is that you eat some alfalfa. It'll stop you getting sick.
Bluey: Okay, dude.
Chilli: And stop calling me dude.
Bluey: Sorry, dude.
Bandit: Bluey, can it.
Bluey: Sure thing, dude! 
Bandit: Bluey, I'm serious!
Bluey: What's up with these dudes?
Bingo is laughing joyfully. Scene cuts back to Bluey laughing at the table. Bingo smiles briefly before frowning again.
Bandit: That was a fun three hours.
Bluey: Bingo, do you want to have your turn now?
Bingo shakes her head, declining Bluey's plea. Chilli sets down her utensils for a turn.
Chilli: Well, I'll have a turn.
Bluey: Wait, Mum! 
Bandit: Argh! 
Bluey: Can you make sure that your favourite thing is something where Bingo does something really funny in it?
Chilli: Okay, sweetheart. 
Bandit: Argh!
Bluey: Proceed.
Chilli: Well, my favourite thing happened at lunchtime.
A brief flashback shows the Heelers having lunch at an outdoor restaurant. Bingo places her paws together and turns to Chilli.
Bingo: Mum?
Chilli: Yes?
Bingo: Open the lid.
Chilli: Okay. 
Bingo: Stick your finger in.

Scene cuts back to Bandit and Bluey laughing at the dinner table. Bingo is smiling for a moment.

Bandit: Yeah, mate? 
Bingo: What's your name?
Bandit: Dad.
Bingo: And what is this? 
Bandit: Nose. 
Bingo: And what am I holding?
Bandit: Uhh... nothing! 
Bingo: "Dad knows nothing."
Bandit: Aw, what?!
Bingo is laughing joyfully. Scene cuts back to Bluey, Bingo and Chilli laughing at Bandit at the table. He rolls over his eyes away and crosses his arms.
Chilli: Oh, you poor dad.
Bluey: That was funny. Now that I think about it, my real favourite thing, actually, was when Bingo and I were eating morning tea.
Scene cuts to the first brief flashback where Bingo is struggling to pick up a cherry tomato with her fork.
Bluey: Bingo was trying to eat cherry tomatoes with her fork.
Bingo: This is difficult.
Bingo makes an effort to catch a cherry tomato, but the strong pressure causes the tomato to fly away at an incredible speed and hits Bandit's forehead while carrying a dog gnome.
Bandit: Ya-oww!
Bandit falling backwards causes the gnome to fly up in the air and lands down on the grass. Looking up in the sky, a large imaginary pink hippo is seen, completely blissful and unaware as it continues plummeting down and about to land onto the gnome.
Bandit: Jeremy! No!
Chilli: Who will save Jeremy from the falling hippo?!
Bingo: I will!
Bingo imagines a jetpack on her back and rockets up in the sky to catch the heavy hippo with all her might.
Chilli & Bluey: Yeah!
Bingo places the hippo on the grass to keep a safe distance from Jeremy the gnome. She smiles with heroic confidence.
Chilli: Thanks, Jetpack Bingo!
Bingo gives a thumbs up. Bandit starts cradling and smooching the hippo's bottom.
Bandit: Ooh! Ooh, hippo! Mwah, mwah, mwah. I love you.
Scene cuts back to Bluey finishing her story at the table. Bandit was dumbfounded hearing her words.
Bandit: WHAT?! I don't remember that!
Bluey: Hooray, you're happy again! 
Bingo: No, I'm not.
Bluey: This isn't fair, Bingo! I said sorry. And I tried a hundred times to cheer you up, but you're still trying to make me even more sad.
Bingo: I can't help it.
Chilli: She's not trying to make you feel sad, Bluey.
Bingo: I'm just sad.
Bingo leaves the table and hides next to the dishwasher, wanting to be alone.
Bluey: But, Bingo...!
Chilli: Just let her go.
Bluey: But why is she still sad? I thought I fixed her!
Chilli: You can't always fix people, sweetheart. She'll come good. Just eat your dinner.
Bluey: I don't feel like eating now.
Bluey pushes her plate from her. Bandit takes Bluey's last steak piece and eats it.
Bandit: Mmm! More for me.
Chilli: Bandit! She's upset.
Bandit: Yeah, but she's easy to cheer up.
Bluey: No, I'm not!
Bandit: Yeah, you are. Dude! Pass me the tomato sauce, dude. 
Bluey: Don't call me dude!
Bandit: Why not, DUDE? Pass the salt. Thanks, DUDE.
Chilli: Don't you dude me!
Bluey's loud squeal causes Bingo to look at the family, curiously.
Bandit: Hey, dude! 
Bluey: Come have dinner, dude.
Bingo: Okay, dude. 
Bluey: Here's the sauce, dude.
Bingo: Thanks, dude. 
Bandit: Okay. All good.
Bingo: Is it my turn for my favourite thing that happened today?
Bandit: Yep, I think it is.
Bluey: Maybe let's not to play that game.
Chilli: Yeah, I agree.
Bandit: Yeah, we're living' in the past, dudes.
Bluey: How about it still has to be a favourite thing, but it has to be something happening right now?
Chilli: Oh, I like that.
Bandit: Yeah, live in the now, dude.
Chilli: Stop calling us dude!
Bluey: Okay, go, Bingo.
Bingo: Ooh, okay. Ah... Hmm. Umm...
Bluey: Not much happening right now.
Chilli: Yeah.
Bandit holds his glass of water and drinks it.
Bingo: This is trifficult.
Bandit suddenly coughs up the water out of his mouth and nose; he spits the water on the floor as Bluey, Bingo and Chilli laugh together at Bandit.
Bingo: That's my favourite thing!
