The episode opens with an establishing shot of the window of a hospital room. The windowsill has some get well soon cards - one with a fairy bread godmother, one with googley-eyed bandages, and one with a teddy bear wearing a bandage. Beside the window is a mylar heart baloon and a bouquet of flowers.
The shot changes. It is now centered on Bingo, sitting on a hospital bed. Behind the head of the bed is a large picture of tropical fish. A tablet is sitting on the foot of the bed. Chilli sits at her bedside, and a doctor is holding a stethoscope on Bingo's back.
Doctor: Okay, take a big breath in for me, Bingo.
Bingo takes a deep breath.
Doctor: Ooh, that was a big one.
Bingo: (whispering to Chilli) Can you ask her if I can go home?
Chilli: Do you think we can go home soon, Doctor?
The doctor makes a note on Bingo's chart.
Doctor: We might just keep you in for another night, Bingo, just to keep an eye on you.
The doctor leaves. Bingo hugs her own knees.
Bingo: I wanna go home.
Chilli: (sighs) I know, kid.
Chilli pats Bingo's back.
Chilli: Me too.
Bingo: It's not fair.
Chilli: Yeah, I guess it isn't. But here we are.
The tablet chimes.
Chilli: Oh, look. 
Chilli picks up the tablet.
Chilli: Dad sent us a message.
Chilli swipes to open the message. The tablet chimes again.
Chilli It's a video!
Bingo: Can I push play?
Chilli Yeah. Go on.
The shot changes to show the tablet from Bingo's perspective. Bingo taps the play button. The episode title card appears, framed in the tablet.
TITLE CARD - Bumpy and the Wise Old Wolfhound
Bluey: This story is called Bumpy and the Wise Old Wolfhound.
The tablet cuts to a blurry shot of Bluey wearing purple underpants. The shot zooms back, and the shot goes in and out of focus as the camera adjusts automatically. Bluey is standing in front of the front steps of the Heeler house.
Bluey: Hi! I'm Barnicus.
The shot changes to Bingo and Chilli in the hospital.
Bingo: It's Bluey!
Chilli: Yeah!
Bingo: (giggles)
Chilli: Why is she wearing purple underpants?
The shot changes to show the tablet again.
Bluey: Once, there was a young lady called Barnicus.
Bluey pulls up the waistband of her underpants.
The shot changes to Bingo and Chilli in the hospital.
Bingo: (giggles) Barnicus!
The shot changes back to the tablet. The camera zooms in until the video fills the frame.
Bluey: What Barnicus wanted more than anything in the world was a puppy!
Bluey: (as Barnicus) I really want a puppy!
The scene changes to the playroom. Bandit (who is also wearing purple underpants) is sitting at the counter of a produce stand. Bluey enters, carrying a shopping basket. Both of them are staring at the camera and smiling unnaturally.
Bluey: All day, she would say the same thing.
Bluey, who is looking at the camera instead of where she's walking, bumps into the produce stand.
Bandit: (woodenly, as Shopkeeper) Here's... your carrots... Barnicus.
Bandit sets a pair of wooden carrots on the counter. Bluey picks one up and considers it.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) These carrots are nice, but what I really want is my very own puppy.
Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) Maybe you should wish upon a star!
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Okay.
With a star wipe, the scene changes to Bluey in front of a blue sheet with stars. A Christmas ornament star hangs from a string, swaying.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, twinkly star, please may I have a puppy?
Something wooden clatters to the floor offscreen. Half of the backdrop droops, revealing Bandit, who is holding the broomstick that suspends the star.
Bandit: Argh!
The scene cuts to Bluey in her bed. She pantomimes waking up and yawning.
Bluey: And then the next morning, she woke up...
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, my wish came true!
Bluey points, and the camera pans over. Socks is struggling at the foot of the bed, and we can see Stripe's arms as he tries to hold her still.
Socks: (snarls)
Bluey: (as Barnicus) My very own puppy!
Socks bites Stripe on the hand.
Stripe: Arghh--
The camera beeps, cutting off the scene mid-yell. Now Bluey is holding Socks, who is happily eating a chocolate chip cookie out of Stripe's hand.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) I will call you Bumpy.
The shot changes to Bingo and Chilli in the hospital. A nurse is taking Bingo's blood pressure, and watching the tablet over her shoulder.
Bingo: Hee hee, Bumpy!
Nurse: Why is everyone wearing purple pants?
The shot changes back to the produce stand. Bluey is dragging a struggling Socks on a leash.
Bluey: Barnicus and Bumpy went everywhere together.
Socks: (snarls)
Bluey: (as Barnicus) I'll have some carrots, please, shopkeeper. Bumpy loves carrots.
Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) Oh, yes. What a lovely --
Socks darts forward and bites Bandit on the ankle.
Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) puppy! Ow! So gentle and mild! Owww!
The camera falls on its side as Stripe drops it and enters the frame to break up Socks and Bandit.
Stripe: Cut! Stop it!
The shot changes to Bingo, Chilli, and the nurse in the hospital.
All: (laugh)
Bandit: (from tablet) Owww!
The shot changes to Bluey and Stripe skipping through a field.
Bluey: Barnicus was finally happy.
Socks' eyes widen, then she stops moving. She squats.
Socks: (grunting) Hueah!
Socks pans out of frame as the camera continues following Bluey. Just as Bluey notices what's going on behind her, the scene cuts.
The shot changes to Bluey in her bed, and again she pantomimes waking up and yawning.
Bluey: Then, one day, Barnicus woke up to discover that Bumpy was very sick.
Bluey puts her hands to her face in shock. The camera pans to show Socks, panting happily and covered in colorful dots.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, no! Bumpy's sick!
The scene transitions with a clock wipe. Still on Bluey's bed, Bluey is sadly patting Socks, who is chewing on her own leg. Outside the window, Bandit is holding a piece of cardboard with a sunny sky painted on it, and Muffin holds a piece of cardboard with a moonlight night sky. They shuffle past the window one after the other to show the passage of time.
Bluey: Lots of days and nights went by, but Bumpy wasn't getting better.
Muffin trips, dropping her cardboard. Bandit peers over the top of his cardboard, looking a bit concerned. The shot changes to show just Bluey and Socks, who is now chewing on her elbow.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) It's not fair.
The scene changes to the back yard. Lucky is fishing in a wading pool with a magnetic fishing toy. He's wearing purple underpants. Bluey carries Socks (who is now tightly swaddled in a blanket) into the shot.
Bluey: Barnicus wandered around looking for help...
Lucky looks at Socks, and shakes his head sadly.
The scene cuts to Mackenzie, who is wearing purple underpants and hammering on the fence with an inflatable hammer.
Bluey: ...but no one knew how to fix Socks --
Mackenzie looks at socks, and shrugs and shakes his head.
Bluey: --Oh, I mean Bumpy.
The scene cuts to the produce stand again. The shopkeeper's leg is covered in colorful bandages.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Shopkeeper, please can you help Bumpy?
Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) Sorry, I only know how to sell carrots.
Bandit holds up a wooden carrot to illustrate.
The scene transitions with a comb wipe. At the base of the stairs in the green living room, Muffin is standing on a cushion. She's wearing a chef's toque and is stirring the "contents" of a wide china vase with a wooden spoon. She is also wearing purple underpants. The china vase wobbles as Muffin stirs.
Bluey: Finally, she asked the baker.
The scene cuts back to the hospital. The nurse is gone.
Chilli: Oh, no, Muffin. That's my good vase.
The scene cuts back to Muffin. Bluey enters carrying Socks, who is still swaddled. Muffin waves.
Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Hi, Bluey. Did you want pancakes?
The scene cuts back to Bingo.
Bingo: (giggles) Muffin, her name is Barnicus!
The scene cuts back to Muffin.
Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Why doon't... um...
The camera beeps, and Stripe appears behind Muffin. Bluey looks bored, and Socks is asleep.
Stripe: (whispering) Why don't you try the Wise Old Wolfhound, Barnicus?
The camera beeps again, and Stripe is gone. Bluey and Socks are alert again. Muffin, however, is staring at someone behind her.
Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Why don't you try the Wise Old Wolfhound, Bluey?
Stripe: (whispering from off camera) Barnicus!
Muffin: (confused) I mean, Barnicus...?
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, yes, of course! Thanks, baker lady!
Bluey runs off with Socks. Muffin puts down the spoon and approaches the camera.
Muffin: Was that all right, Dad?
The camera beeps, and Muffin is back on the cushion. She waves with the wooden spoon, knocking over the vase.
Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Good luck, Bluey!
The vase breaks.
The scene cuts back to the hospital.
Bingo: (giggles)
Chilli puts her head in her hands.
Chilli: Oh, Muffin!
The scene cuts back to Muffin, who is staring at the remains of the vase. After a moment, Bandit leans into the frame.
Bandit: We can edit that bit out, right?
The camera beeps, and the scene cuts back Bluey, who is running across the back yard carrying Socks.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Don't worry, Bumpy. The Wise Old Wolfhound will be able to magic you better.
Bluey reaches her destination: a tent. The tent has been decorated with stars and flags. The salt lamp, a crystal ball, and a geode have been set in front of it as "magical artifacts".
Bluey enters the tent.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) (gasps)
Inside the tent is Trixie. She's sitting in lotus position, wearing a flower crown and a bathrobe, which she is wearing over one shoulder in imitation of a Buddhist monk's robe. She is in a spotlight. She opens her eyes and waves to Bluey - as she does so, a psychedelic filter is applied to the video.
The scene cuts to Bingo.
Bingo: Hee hee! It's Aunt Trixie!
The scene cuts back to the tent. A C.H. monogram is sometimes visible on Trixie's bathrobe.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, Wise Old Wolfhound, Bumpy is sick!
Bluey puts Socks down on the floor, and sits down cross-legged.
Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Oh, poor little fella.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) It's not fair! Please, can you help him?
Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) I am not a puppy doctor.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Please, can you magic him better?
Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Magic?
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Please, please, please!
Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Okay, little one. Perhaps there is a way I can help.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, wonderful!
Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Bring me a pair of purple underpants.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Okay!
Without hesitation, Bluey stands and takes off her underpants.
The scene cuts back to the hospital. The nurse is watching over Bingo's shoulder again.
Bingo: (giggles)
Chilli: Ah.
Chilli and Nurse: Now it's making sense.
The scene cuts back to the Wise Old Wolfhound's tent.
Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Whoa! I'm not finished. I need a pair of purple underpants from someone who's never been sick.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Never been sick?
Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Never been sick.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh.
Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Have you ever been sick?
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, yes. I had a runny nose last year.
Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Well, it will have to be someone else's purple underpants, I'm afraid.
Bluey puts her underpants back on.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) No problems! I'll get some from someone in town. 
Bluey picks up Socks and runs out.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) We'll be right back!
Trixie: (as Wise Old Wolfhound) Good luck, Barnicus!
The scene cuts back to the produce stand.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Shopkeeper, shopkeeper! The wise old Wolfhound's gonna help my puppy! I just need a pair of purple pants.
Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) Sure! I'll give you anything if it helps Bumpy.
Bandit stands up and yanks down his underwear.
The scene cuts to the hospital.
Bingo: (giggles)
Chilli and Nurse: Ewww!
Chilli: Oh, dear.
The scene cuts to the produce stand. Bandit hands Bluey his underpants.
Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) There you go.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Thanks. 
Bluey takes the underpants and turns to leave.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Wait. I forgot to ask. Have you ever been sick?
Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) Sick? Oh. Well, yes. I've got --
The camera suddenly zooms in on Bandit's face as a dramatic music sting plays.
Bandit: (as Shopkeeper) -- bum worms.
The scene cuts to the hospital.
Bingo: (gasps)
Chilli: Ewww!
Nurse: (laughs)
Chilli: Good grief!
Bingo: She can't use those pants.
The scene cuts to the produce stand.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, okay. Thanks anyway.
Bluey returns Bandit's underpants.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) I'll have to try someone else.
Bingo: (as Shopkeeper) Good luck!
Stripe: (offscreen) And cut.
Bandit hurriedly scratches his bum.
The scene cuts back to Muffin as the baker lady. The vase has been replaced with an upside-down hat.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Baker lady, have you ever been sick?
Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Yes. I was sick yast lear.
The camera beeps.
Muffin: (as Baker Lady) I was sick yast lear.
The camera beeps.
Muffin: (as Baker Lady) I was sick last week.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh.
Muffin: (as Baker Lady) I had wabies.
The scene cuts back to the hospital.
Nurse: (laughs)
Chilli: (laughing) What?
The scene cuts back to Muffin, Bluey, and Socks.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Okay, no. 
Muffin scratches her bum while making direct eye contact with the camera.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) I can't use your purple pants. Thanks, baker lady.
Muffin: (as Baker Lady) Bye, Bluey!
Bluey: (offscreen) Barnicus!
The scene cuts to Lucky fishing. Bluey says something, and he shakes his head.
Bluey: Barnicus kept trying.
The scene cuts to Mackenzie. Bluey says something, and he shakes his head.
Bluey: But she couldn't find a single person...
The scene cuts to the front steps. Bluey sadly sits down on the stairs, holding Socks.
Bluey: ... that's never been sick.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Oh, I can't find a single pair of purple pants from someone who's never been sick. It's not fair.
Bluey gasps theatrically.
Bluey: And then... Barnicus realized what the wise old Wolfhound was trying to teach her.
Bluey: (as Barnicus) Ohh. Everyone gets sick sometimes, not just Bumpy.
The scene cuts back to the hospital. The nurse is gone.
Bluey: (from the tablet) Being sick is just a part of life.
Chilli: (sniffles)
The scene cuts back to Bluey's bed. She pats Socks' head; and Socks chews on her own leg again. Muffin is outside the window, holding up the night drawing.
Bluey: So from then on, Barnicus stopped thinking that it wasn't fair that Bumpy was sick.
Bluey hugs Socks, who stops chewing on her leg to lean into it.
The scene cuts to later on Bluey's bed. Now Bandit is holding up the daytime drawing. Bluey is reading a picture book to Socks, who is paying attention.
Bluey: She read books to Bumpy...
The scene cuts to Bluey's bed. Muffin is holding up the night drawing again. Bluey is drawing with markers. Muffin is chewing on a piece of paper.
Bluey: ... did coloring in...
The scene cuts to Bluey's bed. Bandit is holding up the day drawing again. Both Bluey and Muffin are watching something on a tablet.
Bluey: ...and watched cartoons together.
The scene cuts to Bluey's bed. Bluey pantomimes waking up.
Bluey: Until one morning, she awoke...
Uncle Stripe's hands are briefly visible as he tosses Socks into Bluey's lap. Socks no longer has spots.
Bluey: ...to find Bumpy all better!
Socks: (yips happily)
The scene cuts back to the hospital. The nurse is back.
Chilli, Bingo, and Nurse: Hooray!
Bingo: (squeals)
Chilli: Yeah!
The scene cuts to the front of the house. Everyone involved in the video is lined up, from left to right: Lucky, Mackenzie, Trixie, Bandit, Stripe, Bluey, Socks, and Muffin. Bluey is awkwardly holding Socks. Most of the characters link hands, hold them high, and bow (as the cast of a stage play does). Bluey and Muffin cannot, because Bluey's hands are full; they awkwardly half-bow instead.
Everyone but Bluey and Socks waves.
'All: See you tomorrow, Bingo!
Socks squirms free of Bluey's grasp, and bites Bandit on the ankle.
Bandit: Owww!
Bandit falls over. He struggles free for a moment.
Bandit: (laughing) Socks!
Socks bites Bandit on the bum. Everyone but Bluey and Muffin starts to laugh. Bluey looks worried She takes a step back, and knocks Muffin's toque over her eyes. Muffin stumbles around blindly. Stripe grabs Socks by the legs and tries to pull her off Bandit.
Bandit: Ow!
Stripe: Careful, Socks, he's got bum worms!
Muffin stumbles into Bluey and falls down.
The scene cuts back to the hospital.
Chilli, Bingo, and Nurse: (laugh)
Bingo: Again!
The music during the credits is the full arrangement of the episode music with strings and voice that plays after Bumpy gets better.
