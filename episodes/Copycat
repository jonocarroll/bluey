The camera pulls back. Bluey is sitting on the foot of the bed, copying Bandit's pose.
Bandit: "Huh?"
Bluey: "Huh?"
Bandit: "Are you copying me?"
Bluey: "Are you copying me?"

TITLE CARD - Copycat
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Copycat."
Cut to the balcony outside Bandit and Chilli's bedroom. Bandit and Bluey walk out, and begin to stretch simultaneously.
Bandit: "Ohh."
Bluey: "Ohh."
Bandit and Bluey turn to face each other. Bandit holds out his right arm, then his left. Bluey mirrors him. In perfect sync, they put one arm, then the other on their faces, then their bums, while jumping from one foot to the other. They put their hands on their knees and do the Charleston, ending with a little jump with arms held high.
Bandit, Bluey: "Ha!"
They lean their faces close together.
Bandit, Bluey: "Hoo!"
They close one eye...
Bandit, Bluey: "Huh!"
...then the other.
Bandit, Bluey: "Hah!"
They squint..."
Bandit, Bluey: "Hm!"
... and open their eyes wide.
Bandit, Bluey: "Hip!"
They cross their eyes and stick out their tongues.
Bandit, Bluey: "Blblbl!"
They howl.
Bandit, Bluey: "Awoo!"
They lean backward.
Bandit, Bluey: "Ha!"
They spin in circles, eyes crossed and sticking out their tongues.
Bandit, Bluey: "Blubl blabl blubl!"
They run off screaming.
Bandit, Bluey: "Aaaah!"
Bandit runs into the bathroom, panting. Bluey follows him a moment later, pretending to pant. He runs some water, washing his hands and splashing his face.
Bandit: "I am Bluey, and I stink like a monkey's butt."
Bluey, at the other sink, pretends to run some water, wash her hands, and splash her face. Bandit dries his hands with a towel.
Bluey: "I am Bluey, and I stink like a monkey's butt."
Bluey pretends to dry her hands.
Bandit: "Well, good that we can agree on that, then."
Cut to the front yard. Bandit marches down the front steps, followed by Bluey.
Bandit: "Time for my morning walk."
Bluey: "Time for my morning walk."
Bandit: "I like to walk really far!"
Cut to the footpath in front of a neighbor's house.
Bandit: "And I like to walk like this!"
Bandit begins to power-walk, swinging his hips from side to side. Bluey copies him.
Bandit: "Like those guys in the Olympics. A doo-doo-doo-doo-doo."
Bluey laughs and joins in.
Bluey, Bandit: "Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo!"
Wendy passes them, going the other way. Bandit and Bluey salute her.
Bandit: "Morning, Wendy!"
They stop to talk.
Bandit: "Do you know I like to smack my bum as hard as I can?"
Bandit sticks out his bum and starts smacking it. Bluey and Wendy just stare.
Bandit: "Ooh! Oww! Ooh! Aah! Ungh! Unh!"
Bluey turns to Wendy and shrugs.
Bandit: "Aah! Ow! Ooh! Aah! Ow!"" 
Wendy shakes her head, rolls her eyes, and walks away.
Bandit: "Unh! Aah!"
Bandit stops smacking his bum.
Bandit: "Where were you on that one?"
Bluey: (mocking) "Where were you on that one?"
Bandit takes off running.
Bandit: "Grrr!"
Bluey: "Grrr!"
They run past a tree.
Bandit, Bluey: "Stop copying me!"
Bluey stops. She sees a bird lying on the ground under the tree. The bird chirps.
Bluey: "Hey Dad, stop."
Bluey and Bandit approach the bird and crouch down.
Bluey: "It's a bird! But it's on the ground."
Bandit: "It's a little budgie."
Bluey: "Is it okay?"
Bandit: "Hmm... no, it looks hurt."
Bluey: "What do we do?"
Bandit: "We'd better get him some help."
Bandit reaches for the bird.
Bandit: "Here, come here—"
The bird chirps, and Bandit pulls his hand back.
Bandit: "—Ow!"
Bluey: "Ooh!"
Bandit: "He nipped me!"
Bandit clenches his fist.
Bandit: "Toughen up, Bandit!"
Bluey: "He's scared."
Bandit: "Bluey, run inside and get a shoebox and a tea towel to make a little bed for him."
Bluey: "Okay."
Cut to the kitchen. Bluey, holding a shoebox, runs up to the oven, where a pair of tea towels are hanging over the handle.
Bluey: "Um, which one?"
She points at one tea towel, then the other.
Bluey: "Big Ben or Outback?"
Bandit: (offscreen) "Hurry up, Bluey!"
Bluey: "Outback."
She puts the chosen tea towel in the shoebox.
Cut back to the tree. Bluey arrives with the shoebox. Bandit uses the towel to scoop up the bird.
Bandit: "Come here."
Bluey: "Ooh, be careful!"
Bandit: "He's as light as a feather."
He sets the bird in the shoebox and adjusts the towel.
Bandit: "There you go, little mate. Warm and toasty."
He picks up the shoebox and stands.
Bluey: "What do we do now?"
Bandit: "We go to the vet."
Cut to the driveway.
Bluey: "Are birds meant to drive in cars?"
Bandit opens the front passenger door and puts the shoebox on the passenger seat.
Bandit: "No, they usually fly."
Bandit closes the door. Bluey climbs into the back seat as Bandit walks around to the driver's side.
Bluey: "What if the seat belt doesn't fit?"
Bandit: "Don't worry, I know just what to do."
Cut to a moving shot of power lines. A grey butcherbird is perched on the lines.
Cut to the car. Bandit is driving, using his left hand to hold the shoebox in place. Bluey watches worriedly from the back seat.
Bluey: "You're a good seat belt, Dad."
Bandit: "Thanks."
He takes his hand off the shoebox to honk the horn.
Bandit: "It's green, mate! Get off your phone!"
Bluey: "Aah! Keep being a seat belt!"
Bandit: "Oh!"
He hurriedly puts his hand back on the shoebox.
Cut to the street outside a veterinary clinic. Bandit parks the car on the side of the road. They get out with the shoebox, and pause at the crosswalk as a car drives past.
Bandit: "Watch out for cars."
They enter the veterinary clinic. The Surfer is on her way out with a goldfish with a bandaged fin. A man in a hat sits in the waiting room with a blue-tongued skink with a bandaged tail. Bandit and Bluey take the budgie up to the corgi at the front desk.
Bandit: "Excuse me, we found this little fella. I think a cat might have got to him."
Vet Corgi: "Oh, thank you. Come here, little one."
She picks up the box.
Vet Corgi: "I'll get him to our vet."
She takes him into the back. Bandit waves.
Bandit: "Good luck, little mate."
Cut to a shot of the vet's desk. A goldfish with a bandaged fin swims in a bowl; in the foreground are a stack of pamphlets and a bell.
Cut to a shot of the other customer, waiting with his skink. The skink sticks out its tongue.

Cut to Bandit and Bluey, sitting on a bench in the waiting room.
Bluey: "Will the budgie be okay?"
Bandit: "I don't know. He looked pretty knocked around."
They both slump a little and look at the floor.
Bluey: "I hope he is."
Bandit puts his hand on Bluey's back.
The Vet Corgi comes out and kneels next to Bluey.
Vet Corgi: "I'm sorry. It's bad news, I'm afraid. The little budgie died."
Bluey looks away, saddened.
Bluey: "Oh... Okay."
Bandit: "Aw, sorry, kiddo."
Bandit kneels down to hug Bluey.

Cut to a moving shot of power lines.
Cut to the interior of the car. Bluey looks out the window; following the arc of the power lines with her eyes.
She turns to Bandit.
Bluey: "Dad?"
Bandit: "Yes, mate?"
Bluey: "I don't want the budgie to have died."
Bandit: "I know. Me neither. But there's nothing we can do. It's out of our hands."
Bluey: "Are you sure he won't get better?"
Bandit: "Yeah, I'm sure."
The car arrives back at the house. Chilli is waiting for them, holding Bingo. She kneels down as they get out of the car, and Bluey runs to hug her.
Chilli: "Oh, Bluey."
Cut to a shot of the sky over the treetops. It's still very early morning, as the moon and stars are visible. A pair of honeyeaters fly past.

Bingo: ♫ "Dee, doo, doo, doo dee, doo, dee-doo-doo." ♫
Bluey: "Bingo?"
Bingo: "Yeah?"
Bluey: "Can you pretend to be a budgie?"
Bingo: "Okay!"

Bluey: "Oh, g'day, little fella."
She crouches down next to Bingo.
Bluey: "You look hurt. We best get you some help."
She reaches towards Bingo.
Bluey: (stage whisper) "Bingo, you have to nip me."
Bingo: "Okay."
She bites Bluey on the elbow. Bluey falls back, rubbing her elbow.
Bluey: "OW! Bingo!"
Bingo giggles.
Bluey: (laughing) "That wasn't a nip! That was a chomp!"
Bingo: "Rrreee!"
Bluey makes a fist.
Bluey: "Toughen up, Bluey. I'll get you a shoebox."
Bluey runs off.
Bingo: "Tweet, tweet! Tweeet!"
Bluey returns with a shoebox with a tea towel in it.
Bluey: "Come on, little mate."
She picks up Bingo.
Bluey: "Ough! Oof!"
She strains to carry Bingo over to the shoebox.
Bluey: (strained) "Light... as a...feather!"
She drops Bingo into the shoebox (only her bum actually fits in the box), tipping the shoebox over and falling over as she does so.
Bluey: "Ooh!"
Bingo: "Tweet!"
Bluey stands back up and tips the shoebox back upright.
Bluey: "Urgh!"
Bingo: "Rrreee!"
She pats Bingo's foot.
Bluey: "There you go, little mate. You'll be nice and toasty in here."
Bluey picks up the shoebox.
Bingo: "Tweet!"

Bluey: "Aaaah! Ouch!"
Bingo: "Rrreee!"
Bluey: "Got to watch out for cars."
Cut to the playroom. Chilli is at the entrance of the fabric-roofed play house, which is set up with a couple of benches forming a front desk. Bluey enters at a run, colliding with the bench as she sets Bingo down.
Bluey: "There... you... go!"
Bingo: "Rrrreee!"
Chilli: "Hello, dear. What seems to be the matter?"
Bluey: "I think a cat beat this feller up."
Chilli: "Oh, goodness, come here."
Chilli picks up Bingo with a grunt.
Chilli: "Take a seat. I'll take him to see our vet."
Chilli carries Bingo back into the play house.
Bluey: "Good luck, little mate."
She sits down next to a teddy bear, which has been given a similar hat to the customer in the waiting room, and even a plush blue-tongued skink.
Bluey: "I hope the poor little budgie's okay. I'm pretty sure he won't be."
Chilli comes back out, and kneels down next to Bluey.
Chillli: "I've got good news! Your bird is okay."
Bluey waves her hands, signalling a time out. Chilli leans closer.
Bluey: "Oh, no, no, Mum, you have to pretend it's bad news. That the budgie's dead."
Chilli: "Oh. Are you sure?"
Bluey: "Yeah, I'm sure."
Chilli: "Okay, um. I have bad news."
Bluey: "Oh, did the budgie die?"
Chilli puts her hand on Bluey's shoulder.
Chilli: "I'm afraid she did."
Bluey looks down sadly.
Bluey: "Oh... Okay."
After a quiet moment, Bingo suddenly bursts out of the play house, with a cloth bandage wrapped around her middle. She flaps her arms, running in circles around the playroom.
Bingo: "Rrreee! Rrreee! Rrrreee!"
Bluey: "Bingo, what are you doing?! You're not supposed to be better!"
Chilli: "Hmm, we probably should have told the budgie."
Bingo runs out into the back yard. Bluey chases her.
Bluey: "Hey!"
Bingo: "Rrreee! Rrreee! Rrreee!"
Bluey laughs. She jumps at Bingo, but misses. Bingo laughs.
Bingo: "Rrreee! Rrreee!"

They watch Bingo run around the back yard.
Bingo: "Rrreee! Rrreee! Rrreee!"

Chilli: "This isn't how you wanted the game to go, is it?"
Bluey: "No."
Bluey shrugs and cheers up.
Bluey: "That's okay. There's nothing we can do. It's out of our hands."
