TITLE CARD - Copycat
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called "Copycat". 
Bandit and Bluey walked to the verandah, warming up at the same time. They stretch out their arms, touch both sides of their heads, touch their hips, perform the Charleston dance and raise their arms up high in the air.
Bandit & Bluey: Ha! Hoo, huh, ha, hoo, heh, bl-l-l-l-oh! Awoo! Ha! Glurble, glurble, glargh! 
They both run off away from the verandah, screaming. In the ensuite, Bandit washes his face with water while Bluey pretends to wash her face with no water.
Bandit: I am Bluey, and I stink like a monkey's butt.
Bluey: I am Bluey, and I stink like a monkey's butt.
Bandit: Well, good that we can agree on that, then.
Outside, Bandit walks out of the house to the street with Bluey following him.
Bandit: Time for my morning walk.
Bluey: Time for my morning walk.
Bandit: I like to walk really far! And I like to walk like this! Like those guys in the Olympics. A-doo doo doo doo doo doo! 
Bandit & Bluey: Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo... 
Bandit: Morning, Wendy! Do you know I like to smack my bum as hard as I can?
Bandit starts smacking his bottom multiple times, Bluey does not. Wendy glances at Bluey for a silent pause, Bluey shrugs it off. Wendy looks unamused and walks away. Bandit stops smacking and looks at Bluey, baffled at her for not copying his moves.
Bandit: Where were you on that one?
Bluey: Where were you on that one?
Bandit & Bluey: Grrrahhh! Stop copying me!
Bluey hears a weak chirp and notices a small bird lying down on the grass in front of the tree.
Bluey: Hey, Dad, stop. It's a bird! But it's on the ground.
Bandit: It's a little budgie.
Bluey: Is it okay?
Bandit: Hmm... no, it looks hurt.
Bluey: What do we do?
Bandit: We'd better get him some help. Here, come here-- Ow! He nipped me! Toughen up, Bandit!
Bluey: He's scared.
Bandit: Bluey, run inside and get a shoebox and a tea towel to make a little bed for him.
Bluey: Okay.
In the kitchen, Bluey puts down the shoebox and sees two different tea towels on the oven handle.
Bluey: Um, which one? Big Ben or Outback?
Bandit: Hurry up, Bluey!
Bluey: Outback.
Bluey returns to Bandit with the shoebox and tea towel. Bandit begins to lift the budgie slowly into the shoebox with the tea towel.
Bandit: Come here.
Bluey: Ooh, be careful!
Bandit: He's as light as a feather. There you go, little mate. Warm and toasty. 
Bluey: What do we do now?
Bandit: We go to the vet.
Bluey runs back to the car with Bandit following her. Bandit places the budgie in the front passenger seat.
Bluey: Are birds meant to ride in cars?
Bandit: No, they usually fly.
Bluey: What if the seatbelt doesn't fit?
Bandit: Don't worry, I know just what to do.
Scene shows a solitary bird on a power line held by utility poles. The next scene shows Bandit driving while he holds the shoebox with his left paw.
Bluey: You're a good seatbelt, Dad.
Bandit: Thanks. It's green, mate! Get off your phone!
Bluey: Aah! Keep being a seatbelt!
Bandit: Oh! 
Scene shows the veterinary centre on the left side while Bandit parks the car on the right side of the road. As they exit the car, Bandit and Bluey wait at the crossing as a white car passes by.
Bandit: Watch out for cars.
In the veterinary centre, Bandit and Bluey walk to a veterinarian at the reception desk. He gives the budgie to her.
Bandit: Excuse me, we found this little fella. I think a cat might have got to him.
Veterinarian: Ah, thank you. Come here, little one. I'm get him to our vet. 
Bandit: Good luck, little mate.
Scene shows a closeup of the goldfish tank on the reception desk. Next scene shows an owner holding his pet lizard with an injured tail.
Lizard: Blap.
Bluey and Bandit are waiting in the seating area, feeling doubtful.
Bluey: Will the budgie be okay?
Bandit: I don't know. He looked pretty knocked around.
Bluey: I hope he is.
Bandit places his right paw on Bluey's back to comfort her. The veterinarian returns with feelings of melancholy as she gives the unfortunate news to Bluey.
Veterinarian: I'm sorry. It's bad news, I'm afraid. The little budgie died.
Bluey: Oh... okay.
Bandit: Aw, sorry, kiddo. Come here.
Bandit gives a hug to a heartbroken Bluey. The next scene shows Bluey looking up at the utility poles through the car window as Bandit drives her back home.
Bluey: Dad?
Bandit: Yes, mate?
Bluey: I don't want the budgie to have died.
Bandit: I know, me neither. But there's nothing we can do. It's out of our hands.
Bluey: Are you sure he won't get better?
Bandit: Yeah, I'm sure.
Arriving back home, Chilli holds Bingo in her arms. Bluey exits the car and runs to embrace Chilli with grief and sadness.
Chilli: Oh, Bluey.
