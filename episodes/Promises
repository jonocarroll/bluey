Bingo: Night, Dad!
Bluey: Hm!
Dad: Are you're STILL cranky with me?
Bluey: You said we could go to the library.
Dad: It was shut!
Bluey: You promised. And you shouldn't break your promise.
Dad: Yeah, I know, mate, but...
Mum: (SHOUT) Why is this panda puzzle not tidied up?!
Bluey: Uh-oh!
Dad: Quick! Hide!
Mum: Where is she?
Dad: Uh... Where's who?
Mum: The kid who broke her promise to clean up the panda puzzle.
Dad: Ohh! How interesting!
Bluey: Argh!
Dad: Did Bluey break her promise?
Bluey: Well, you broke YOUR promise, so I can break mine.
Mum: What?
Bingo: It's true. Dad broke his promise.
Dad: The library was shut!
Mum: Seems like we've got a promising problem.
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!
Dad: OK, from now on, no-one makes any more promises.
Bingo: But you promised you'd always love us!
Dad: Whoa. I didn't think this through.
Mum: Listen, you can still make promises. You just have to keep them.
Bluey, Bingo and Dad: OK. Yeah.
Bluey and Dad: That makes more sense.
Bingo: Phew!
Dad: Bluey, from now on, we keep our promises. No matter what!
Bluey: No matter what. Well, goodnight, everyone!
Mum: Panda puzzle!
Bluey: Argh!

Dad: I'll play anything with you at the library if you hurry up.
Bluey: Do you promise?
Dad: I promise. Now come on!

Dad: Thanks!
DAD TRYING TO REACH THE BOOK
Bluey: Excuse me, can you help my little brother, please?
Library Dog: Oh, yes. Here you go, young man.
Dad: Read to me.
Library Dog: Oh!
BLOCK FELL DOWN
Dad: Wah.
AT CAFE
Bluey and Bingo: That was funny.
Dad: Yeah, yeah.
Mum: Well done for keeping your promise.
Dad:Thanks. Speaking of - Bluey, do you mind if I put my books in your book bag?
Bluey: Sure!
Dad: You promise you don't mind? It's only two books.
Bluey: Yeah, I promise.
Dad: Great! Here they are.
DAD PUT TWO BIG BOOKS ON THE TABLE
Bluey: What?!
Dad: Ha!
ALL WALKING ON FOOTPATH
Bluey: Wait up! These books are heavy!
Dad: Thanks, Bluey! You're your star.
Mum: OK, listen, you two. You can't use promises to trick each other.
Dad and Bluey: Ohh!
Mum: The whole point of promises is to build trust. If there's no trust, none of this is possible.
Bluey: What, none of the whole world?
Mum: None of it. No libraries, no roads, no power lines.
Bingo: No power lines?!
Bluey: I'm not sure about that. I think we'd still have power lines.
Mum: No, we wouldn't.
Dad: Mum's right. No more promise-y tricks.
Bluey: OK.
Bingo: Ooh! Can we play in the playground?!
Bluey: Yeah, please, can we?
Mum: Yes, but it's almost lunch, so when I say it's time to go, it's time to go.
Bluey: OK, Mum!
Mum: You promise?
Bluey: We promise!
