Cut to the entryway. Chilli kneels down in front of the credenza. She puts the squeaky echidna toy inside and closes the door. She stands up.
Chilli: "There! Tidy."
Bluey dumps a box of puzzle pieces on the floor.
Chilli: (frustrated) "Bluey!"
Bluey: "What?!"
Chilli: "I just tidied. What are you doing?!"
Bluey holds up the puzzle box.
Bluey: "Panda puzzle!"
Chilli: "But Dad's about to take you to the Trampolinium."
Bluey: "It won't take long. The pieces are big. See?"
She holds up a puzzle piece.
Chilli: "Alright. But promise me you'll tidy it up when you're done."
Bluey: "I promise."
Bandit marches in.
Bandit: "Alright! Trampolinium!"
He pumps his fist. Bingo runs after him.
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bluey gets up and starts to run after Bandit.
Chilli: "Bluey! Puzzle!"
Bluey: "I'm not done!"
Cut to the car driving down the street. In the background, Rocko is out jogging, and Doreen waits at the bus stop. Bluey is making a hand puppet.'
Bluey: (making low-pitched bird noises) "Ack ack ack, aaawnk! Ack ack ack!"
She spots the library through the car window.
Bluey: "Ooh, Dad, can we go to the library?"
Bandit: "No, mate, we're going to the Trampolinium."
Bluey: "What about after?"
Bandit: "Uh... Yeah, okay, we can go after."
Bluey: "Do you promise?
Bandit: Yeah, I promise."
Bluey, Bingo: "Hooray!"
Cut to the trampolinium, where several children are bounding in the trampoline enclosure. Bluey and Bingo bounce together, holding hands.
Bluey: "Whee!"
Bingo: "Whoo!"
Bluey: "Whee!"
Bandit walks up to the screen around the trampoline enclosure.
Bandit: "Time to go, kids!"
Bluey, Bingo: "No! No!"
Bandit: "Come on! It's almost dinner."
Bluey, Bingo: "Just one more minute!"
Bandit: "You've had twenty 'one more minute's."
Bluey: "Run, Bingo!"
Bluey and Bingo squeal as they bounce away from Bandit.
Bandit: "That's it, I'm coming in."
Bluey and Bingo continue to squeal as Bandit comes into the trampoline enclosure and chases after them, stumbling on the unstable footing.
Bandit: "Whoa! Hey! Get back here! Whoa!"
Bandit stumbles on the padding between trampolines and falls on his face. Bluey and Bingo bounce by him and laugh. He turns around and crawls after them.
Bandit: "Argh! Stop it!"
Cut back to the car, driving past the library at sunset. Cornelius sits on a bench, reading.
Bluey: "Oh, Dad, can we go to the library now?"
Bandit: "Nah, it's closed, mate."
Bluey: "But you said we could go after the Trampolinium."
Bandit: "Yeah, but we stayed way longer than I thought."
Bluey: (sadly) "But...you promised."
Bandit looks at her in the rear view mirror, then looks back at the road.
Bandit: "Oh, man."

Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Promises"
Cut to Bluey and Bingo's bedroom Bingo is laying down with her eyes closed. Bluey is sitting up in bed with her arms folded. Bandit walks into the doorway.
Bandit: "Night, kids."
Bingo opens her eyes for a moment.
Bingo: "Night, Dad!"
Bluey: "Hmph."
Bandit walks to Bluey's bedside.
Bandit: "Are you still cranky with me?"
Bluey: "You said we could go to the library."
Bandit: "It was shut!"
Bluey: "You promised. And you shouldn't break your promise."
Bandit: "Yeah, I know, mate, but..."
Chilli: (yelling from downstairs) "Why is this panda puzzle not tidied up?!"
Bluey: "Uh-oh!"
Bandit: Quick! Hide!"
Bandit tosses the covers over Bluey's head. Footsteps rapidly approach. Chilli enters the room.
Chilli: (annoyed) "Where is she?"
Bandit: "Uh... Where's who?"
Chilli: "The kid who broke her promise to clean up the panda puzzle."
Bandit: "Ohh! How interesting!"
Bandit pulls the blanket away.
Bluey: "Argh!"
Bandit: "Did Bluey break her promise?"
Bluey: "Well, you broke your promise, so I can break mine."
Chilli: "What?"
Bingo: "It's true. Dad broke his promise."
Bandit: "The library was shut!"
Chilli: "Seems like we've got a promising problem."
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bandit: "Okay, from now on, no-one makes any more promises."
Bingo: (distressed) "But you promised you'd always love us!"
Bandit: "Whoa. I didn't think this through."
Chilli: "Listen, you can still make promises. You just have to keep them.
Bandit, Bluey, Bingo: "Okay, yeah."
Bandit, Bluey: "That makes more sense."
Bingo pretends to wipe sweat from her brow.
Bingo: "Phew!"
Bandit puts Bluey's blanket back on the bed. He holds out his hand with pinky extended.

Chilli: (quietly) "Hey, this morning, I said to Bingo to hurry up, and she said 'I am hurry upping!'"
They both chuckle.
Bluey walks up, taking extremely small steps. She's carrying a tote bag of books.
Bluey: "Dad, will you play Toddlers with us at the library?"
Bandit: "I'll play anything with you at the library if you hurry up."
Bluey: "Do you promise?"
Bandit: "I promise. Now come on!"
Bluey giggles, then turns around and calls out to Bingo.
Bluey: "Bingo, Dad promised to play Toddlers at the library!"

Bandit: "Thanks, Bluey! You're a star."
Chilli: "Okay, listen you two."
Bluey lets go of her bag and rubs her arm.
Chilli: "You can't use promises to trick each other."
Bandit, Bluey: "Ohh!"
Chilli: "The whole point of promises is to build trust. If there's no trust,
none of this is possible."
Chilli gestures widely, indicating all of their surroundings.
Bluey: "What, none of the whole world?"
Chilli: "None of it."
Chilli counts on her fingers.
Chilli: "No libraries, no roads, no power lines."
Bingo: "No power lines?!"
Bluey: "I'm not sure about that. I think we'd still have power lines."
Chilli: "No, we wouldn't."
Bandit: "Mum's right."
Bandit kneels down and extends a pinky to Bluey.
Bandit: "No more promise-y tricks."
Bluey hooks her pinky around his, making another pinky promise.
Bluey: "Okay."
Bingo: "Ooh! Can we play in the playground?!"
