TITLE CARD - Show and Tell
Bluey : This episode of Bluey is called Show and Tell.
The episode opens in the kitchen and dining room. Bluey and Bingo are sitting at the table, with plates of egg on toast and sausage. Bingo is playing with a crab claw, and neither is eating. Bandit is in the kitchen, preparing another serving while he talks on the phone.
Bandit: Bluey, eat your sausage. (to phone) Oh, yeah, g'day. I'm calling about the surfboard you've got for sale.
Bingo shakes the crab claw around.
Bingo: Doo-doo-bee-doo-bee-doo.
Bandit: It's in good nick?
Bluey and Bingo: (laugh)
Bandit: Oh, great. Yeah, I'll take it. (To Bluey) Bluey. Sausage.
Bandit awkwardly holds his phone to the right side of his head with his left hand as he writes.
Bandit: Yep. 16 Pelton Drive. Got it. Okay. See you soon.
Bandit hangs up and pumps his arm.
Bandit: Oos!
Bingo gets up on her knees and turns around on her chair.
Bingo: Are you buying a surfboard?
Bandit: Yep. You wanna come with me to pick it up?
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!
Bandit: Then eat your sausage.
Bandit: Oh...
Bingo sits back down and starts eating.
Bluey: Dad, why do you boss us around
all the time?
Bandit: I don't boss you around.
Bluey: Yes, you do.
Bluey: You're always saying, "Do this" and "Do that."
Bingo: That's true. You do.
Bandit: Didn't we cover this already?
Bluey: Uh, no.
Bandit: Yeah, we did, remember?
Bandit: Your invisible friend, Tina, beat me up; and we all learned that when I tell you to do something, I'm trying to help you.
Bluey: I didn't learn that.
Bingo: Me neither.
Bandit: Really? That's disappointing.
Bandit finishes plating up another serving of egg on toast and sausages. Chilli enters from screen left.
Chilli: Morning!
Bluey and Bingo: Mum!
Chilli gets down on one knee and puts her hand on Bingo's back.
Chilli: Bingo! You ready to practise your show and tell for tomorrow?
Bingo: Um... okay.
Bingo puts down her fork and picks up the crab claw. She gets up and walks into the open part of the dining room, looking a bit nervous. Chilli sits down in Bingo's vacant seat. She looks at the floor as she addresses her family.
Bingo: Hello, everybody.
Bluey and Chilli: Hello, Bingo!
Bingo holds up the crab claw. She looks at it, rather than her audience.
Bingo: Um, I have a crab claw.
Bingo has nothing further to say. The family's faces fall. Bingo looks at them, and back to the crab claw. Bandit walks over to stand by Chilli with his plate of food.
Bandit: It's called show and tell, Bingo.
Chilli elbows him.
Bandit: Oof.
Bingo: I'm good at the showing bit, but not good at the telling bit.
Bandit: Pro tip—keep it simple. Kids switch off if you talk too long.
Chilli gets up, walks over to Bingo, and kneels down in front of her.
Chilli: Maybe you could talk about how crabs have an exoskeleton as opposed to an endoskeleton. 
Bingo raises an eyebrow quizzically.
Chilli: You see—
The camera cuts to show Chilli from Bingo's perspective.
Chilli: —blah blah blah blah skeleton blah blah, blah blah, blah blah—
The camera cuts back to a third-person perspective.
Chilli: —mitochondria. Make sense?
Bingo: No.
Bandit: See?
Chilli sticks out her tongue at him.
Chilli: Nmmm!
The scene cuts to show Bluey and the seat next to her. Bandit takes the empty seat.
Bluey: Can I have some tomato sauce, please?
Bandit hands her a bottle of tomato sauce with a blue cap.
Bandit: Yep.
Bluey: Thanks!
Bluey squeezes some tomato sauce on her plate. Bandit pulls out another bottle of tomato sauce with a white cap, and squeezes it on his toast.
Bluey: Hey, what's that tomato sauce?
Bandit: Oh, uh, this is my tomato sauce.
Bandit begins eating.
Bluey: Well, whose is this tomato sauce?
Bandit: That's your tomato sauce.
Bluey: What's the difference between my tomato sauce and your tomato sauce?
Bandit: Yours is a healthy one. It's got less sugar in it.
Bluey: Oh.
Bluey watches Bandit eat for a moment.
Bluey: Can I taste your tomato sauce?
Bandit: Uh, well... okay. Just a taste.
Bandit squeezes some tomato sauce on Bluey's plate. Bluey dips a piece of sausage in it, and her eyes get big and shiny.
Bluey: Ahh! I want this tomato sauce!
Bandit: No, mate, that one's yours.
Bluey: But yours tastes beautiful!
The camera pulls back to show the whole family at the dinner table.
Bingo: I want to try!
Bandit: Kids eat the healthy one. End of.
Bluey dips a piece of sausage in the full-sugar tomato sauce and passes it to Bingo. Bingo eats it, and her eyes get big and shiny too.
Bingo: (with her mouth full, spraying sausage bits) THIS IS BEAUTIFUL!
Bluey: Why do you get the good one and we get the disgusting one?
Bluey gestures angrily at the low-sugar sauce, while Bingo puts her hands on her hips. Chilli looks amused.
Bandit: Uh...
Chilli: Looks like Dad's good at telling but not good at showing.
Bandit sticks his tongue out at Chilli.
Bandit: Nmmm!
Bluey and Bingo: Pleeease!
Bandit: Nope.
Bluey and Bingo: Aww.
Bluey: That's it—I'm going to count all the times you boss us around.
Bandit: Great. Do it while you eat your sausage.
Bluey: Ah — "Eat your sausage," bossing around number one.
Bluey raises a finger.
Bingo: (mouth full) Number one.
Bandit: Don't talk with your mouth full.
Bluey raises a second finger.
Bluey: That's two.
Bandit: Oh, man.
Chilli squeezes the full-sugar tomato sauce on her eggs and toast.
Chilli: Oh, this is the good stuff.
Bluey and Bingo: Hey!
The scene cuts to the front yard. Bandit is standing by the car, rear door open. Bingo and Bandit are coming down the front steps. Bingo is holding the crab claw.
Bandit: Alright squirts, let's get going.

Bluey: "Let's get going" — that's three.
Bandit: "Let's get going"? That's not bossing you around.
Bluey: Yes, it is.
Bluey and Bingo climb into the car. Bandit closes the door.
Bandit: Gee, you run a tight ship.
The scene cuts to a view through the front windshield. Bandit sits down in the drivers' seat and closes the door.
Bandit: Seatbelts.
Bluey: Four.
Bandit: Oh, come on! Telling you to put seatbelts on is not bossing you around.
Bandit presses some buttons on the in-dash touchscreen.
Bingo: Yes. It. Is.
Bandit turns around.
Bandit: Okay, look here.
Bluey raises a finger on her left hand.
Bluey: "Look here" — that's five.
Bandit: The thing is—
Sat Nav chimes.
Bandit: Oh, uh, hang on a sec.
Bandit turns around to look at the Sat Nav.
Bluey: "Hang on a sec" — six.
Bandit: Hey, Sat Nav—give me directions to 16 Pelton Drive.
Bingo: Now he's bossing Sat Nav around.
Bluey shakes her head sadly.
Bandit: Okay, listen.
Bluey: Seven.
Bandit: Let me explain something to you. What you're calling bossing around, I call—
The camera cuts to show Bandit from Bluey and Bingo's perspective.
Bandit: —blah blah blah cleaning toilets, blah blah blah blah blah—
The camera cuts back to third person view.
Bandit: —solitary confinement. Does that make sense?
Bluey and Bingo: No.
Bandit: Why not?!
Bingo: Too much telling. Kids switch off if you talk too long.
Bluey nods.
Bandit: Ah, well, you need to clean your ears out.
Bandit buckles in.
Bluey: "Clean your ears out" — that's eight.
Bandit: Ughhhhh.
