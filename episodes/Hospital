The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. In the kitchen, Bandit is playing "Mountain Climber" with Bingo.
Bandit: Here comes the mountain climber! Is she gonna (grunts) get to the top? (grunts again) She made it!
Bingo: I made it!
Bluey walks in.
Bandit: Uh-oh, it's getting windy!
Bingo laughs as Bandit moves around.
Bandit: It's getting windy!
Bluey: Look out, Bingo!
Bandit lets Bingo down to the ground.
Bandit: Oh, she's fallen down! (groans)
Bingo: Again, again!
Bluey: Do that to me!
Bandit: Oh, man. Is there some game where I just lie really still on a comfy bed or something?
Bluey and Bingo look at each other.
Bluey and Bingo: Hospitals!
Bandit: Oh, not hospital.
TITLE CARD - a stuffed cat, a stuffed mouse, and the episode title
Bingo : This episode of Bluey is called: Hospital.
In the playroom, Bingo leads Bandit to a bed made of two couch pillows.
Bingo: Please lie here.
Bandit: Thanks, Doctor.
Bingo: No, I'm the nurse.
Bandit: Oh, sorry. Thanks, Nurse. My name is Telemachus.
Bingo picks up a remote control.
Bingo: This remote control makes the bed go up and down, Telemachus.
Bandit: Oh, great!
Bingo: This one makes the legs go up...
Bingo vocalises the sounds of the remote and bed as Bandit's head pillow is pushed up.
Bandit: Ah!
Bingo: Oops, wrong button. Sorry, dear.
Bingo vocalises the sounds of the remote and bed as Bandit's head pillow goes back down, his leg pillow goes up, and then goes back down.
Bandit: Uh! Ah! Oh!
Bingo puts a thermometer in Bandit's mouth.
Bingo: Now don't worry, we're going to make you feel all better.
Bandit: Oh, good. I'm actually a bit nervous at hospitals.
Bingo: There's no need to be nervous.
Suddenly, Bluey is revealed to be standing right next to Bandit.
Bluey: Hello!
Bingo and Bandit: Aah!
Bluey: I'm the doctor!
Bandit: Oh, hello, Doctor. My name is--
Bluey pricks Bandit with a needle (actually a wooden block).
Bluey: Sting!
Bandit: Ouch!
Bingo applies a Band-Aid to the wound consolingly, then moves to gently pat Bandit.
Bingo: Oh, brave boy.
Bandit: What was that??
Bluey: A needle. Now, what seems to be the matter?
Bandit: Why did you give me a needle before asking me what's the matter?
Bluey: Because I'm very busy. Now, what's up?
Bandit: Well, my belly hurts.
Bluey pulls out a stethoscope and listens to Bandit's belly.
Bluey: Have you got a baby in there?
Bandit: No, I don't think so.
Bluey: Nurse, do an X-ray on the big blue guy, please. I think there's a baby in there.
Bingo: Yes, Doctor.
Bingo runs off to get the X-ray machine.
Bandit: Hang on, I really don't think I have a--
Bluey pricks Bandit with another needle.
Bluey: Sting!
Bandit: Ouch!
Bluey: Bye!
Bluey leaves, and Bingo walks back in with a shoebox.
Bandit: Good grief! She certainly likes those needles.
Bingo: Don't worry, sweetie. It's all to make you feel better. Now, time for your X-ray. Ready?
Bandit nods as Bingo prepares to use the shoebox as an X-ray machine on his belly.
Bingo: Three, two, one. (grunts) X-ray!
She runs to draw up an X-ray on paper.
Bingo: X-ray'll be ready in a jiffy!
Bandit: Ah, good. I'll just relax...
Bluey runs back in with the needle at the ready.
Bluey: I'm back! Sting!
She pricks Bandit again.
Bandit: Yow! Bluey! I mean, Doctor. Can that be the last injection, please?
Bluey: Nope.
Bingo walks over with the completed X-ray.
Bingo: Here's the X-ray, Doctor.
Bluey: Oh, thank you. I'll just get this plaster off.
Bandit: Huh?
Bluey rips off the Band-aid.
Bluey: Rip!
Bandit: Ow!
Bingo : Brave boy.
Bingo pats Bandit's head as Bluey takes the X-ray and holds it up.
Bluey: Oh, well this does not look good. You see just here?
Bluey points at the X-ray, where Bingo has drawn a cat inside Bandit.
Bandit: Oh, look. It's a... possum?
Bluey: Yes. You have a possum in your belly.
Bingo: That's not a possum. It's a cat.
Bluey: Oh yeah. You have a cat in your belly.
Bandit: How did it get in there?
Bingo: Did you eat one?
Bandit: No!
Bluey throws the X-ray aside.
Bluey: Well, no one really knows how cats get in your belly, but probably through your belly button?
Bandit: What? Really?
Bluey: Yeah. Probably, they just set up a slide while you're asleep, and just slide right in, you know?
Bandit: My goodness.
Bluey: We'll have to operate.
Bingo: Yes, Doctor.
Bluey and Bingo run to Bandit's other side. Bluey pulls out an egg beater and starts cranking it.
Bandit: Woah, hang on.
Bluey: Let's do this. Here's a magazine to read.
She throws a magazine on Bandit's face. He grunts and removes it.
Bandit: You mean you're not even going to put me to sleep first?
Bluey: Oh, yeah. I guess we could. Nurse, can you put this big blue guy to sleep, please?
Bingo: Yes, Doctor.
Bingo puts a sleep mask over Bandit's mouth and sings as Bandit yawns and falls asleep.
Bingo : Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, big Telemachus...
Bandit snores.
Bingo: He's asleep!
Bluey: Oh, good, I can give him another needle! Sting!
She pricks Bandit again, who is suddenly not sleeping.
Bandit: OW! Bluey!
Bluey: You're meant to be asleep!
Bandit: No. More. Needles!
Bluey: Fine.
Bingo : Go to sleep, go to sleep...
Bandit falls asleep again.
Bingo : He's asleep.
Bluey: Ok, let's go!
Bluey runs the egg beater over Bandit's belly, making whirring sounds as she does.
Bandit: Oh! Oh! Ow!
Bluey: Now, let's get this cat out!
She reaches her hand "into" Bandit. Something squeaks.
Bluey: Oh, I think I got it! (grunts) Here, kitty! Ah!
Bluey pulls out a squeaky stuffed octopus, and quickly begins to struggle with it.
Bingo: Ah! That's not a cat! That's an octopus! Put it back in! I think it's supposed to be in there!
Bluey attempts to shove the octopus back in.
Bluey: Get back in, octopus! So many tentacles!
Bingo: Doctor, catch!
Bingo throws Bluey the remote. Bluey then uses it to pound the octopus back in as it squeaks. Bandit grunts form this.
Bluey: Get. Back. In!
The remote falls in with the octopus.
Bluey: Aah! Bingo! It's got the remote! Let go!
Bandit's bed begins to go haywire, lifting his head and legs at random. The stuffed octopus is still squeaking.
Bandit: Woah!
Bluey: Hey! Let go! Hey, I see that cat! I see the cat! Nurse, give me something to whack it with.
Bingo: Ok.
Bingo hands Bluey an inflatable hammer, which she uses to pound even harder, causing more squeaking from the octopus and more grunting from Bandit Bingo comes over and shines a torch, helping Bluey see.
Bluey: Oh, I've got his tail!
Bingo: Pull it!
Bluey groans, then screams.
Bingo: What happened?
Bluey: It bit me!
Bingo: Oh, you poor dear!
Bingo puts a Band-Aid on Bluey's hand.
Bluey: That cat's not going anywhere!
Bingo: Oh, my.
Bluey: Better wake the big blue guy and tell him.
Bingo: You mean... we can't make him feel all better?
Bluey: No. Wake up, mate!
Bluey snaps the sleep mask against Bandit's face.
Bandit: OW! Bluey!
Bluey: Doctor Bluey.
Bandit: Is the operation finished?
Bluey: Yeah. Sorry. There's nothing we can do. That cat just won't come out.
Bandit: Oh. I see.
Bluey: Now, I've got other patients. You're on your own.
Bandit: What?
Bluey: See ya!
Bluey leaves, and Bingo walks to Bandit's other side to comfort him.
Bandit: Oh, I thought I was going to feel all better.
Bingo: I'm sorry.
Bandit: That's Ok. You tried your best.
Bingo looks around sadly.
Bingo: Hm...
She brightens.
Bingo: Leave it with me.
Bandit: Ok, Nurse.
Bingo goes to add to the X-ray. Over in another part of the playroom, Bluey is examining a stuffed fox with her stethoscope.
Bluey: Those prickles will have to come out, I'm afraid.
Bingo enters with a new drawing.
Bingo: Excuse me, Doctor...
Bluey: I'm very busy, Nurse.
Bingo: I know, but can you look at this X-ray again?
Bluey: If it's from the big blue guy, there's really nothing I can do.
Bingo: Just check it a bit closer.
Bluey: Fine.
Bluey takes the X-ray and examines it as Bingo smiles excitedly.
Bluey: (gasps) Wait a minute! I didn't see this before!
Back in the other part of the playroom, Bandit yawns and relaxes on his bed. Bluey walks over, startling Bandit.
Bluey: Hello, big blue guy.
Bingo: His name's Telemachus.
Bluey: Something else has turned up on your X-ray, Telemachus.
Bandit: Really?
Bluey: Look, here.
Bluey points at the X-ray, where Bingo has added a mouse inside Bandit.
Bandit: Oh, it's a... pot plant?
Bingo: No, it's a mouse.
Bandit: Ah. Of course. A mouse.
Bluey: I think you swallowed a mouse.
Bingo: And then the cat ran in after it!
Bluey: Because cats chase mice!
Bandit: Oh, goodness. What are you going to do?
Bluey: Hmm... What if we lured the mouse out?
Bingo: With some cheese!
Bluey: Then the cat would chase the mouse!
Bandit: Right out of my belly!
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah!
Cut to cheese being hung like bait from a fishing rod by a laughing Bingo as Bluey holds Bandit's mouth open.
Bluey: A little bit lower... a little bit lower...
Bluey reaches down and pulls out a stuffed mouse.
Bluey: There's the mouse!
She pulls out a stuffed cat.
Bluey: Rawr! And there's the cat!
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Bingo goes to take the cat and Bluey walks around Bandit.
Bingo: Oh, good kitty.
Bluey: How do you feel?
Bandit: Hmm... I feel all better!
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Bandit: Thanks, Doctor. And thank you, Nurse.
Bingo pats Bandit's head.
Bingo: You're welcome.
Bandit: Well, if that's that, I guess I'll be on my way.
Bandit stretches and gets up.
Bluey: Oh, one more thing.
Bandit: What's that?
Bluey pricks Bandit with the needle yet again.
Bluey: Sting!
Bandit: Ow!
The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - an acapella groove. Bluey is dancing.
