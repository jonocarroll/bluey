The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. In the kitchen, Bandit is playing 'Mountain Climber' with Bingo - pulling on her hands so she can 'walk' up him.
Bandit: "Here comes the mountain climber! Is she gonna — ugh — get to the top?"
Bandit grunts as he lifts her the final bit. Bingo sits on his nose.
Bandit: She made it!"
Bingo: "I made it!"
Bluey walks in. She smiles and wags her tail, watching Bandit and Bingo play.
Bandit: "Uh-oh, it's getting windy!"
Bingo laughs as Bandit sways back and forth.
Bandit: "It's getting windy!"
Bluey: "Look out, Bingo!"
Bandit lets Bingo down to the ground.
Bandit: "Oh, she's fallen down!" 
Bandit stretches his back and groans.
Bingo: "Again, again!"
Bluey: "Do that to me!"
Bandit: "Oh, man. Is there some game where I just lie really still on a comfy bed or something?"
Bluey and Bingo look at each other.
Bluey, Bingo: "Hospitals!"
Bandit: "Oh, not hospital."
TITLE CARD - Hospital
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called: Hospital."
In the playroom, Bingo leads Bandit to a bed made of two couch cushions.
Bingo: "Please lie here."
Bandit: "Thanks, Doctor."
Bingo: "No, I'm the nurse."
Bandit: "Oh, sorry. Thanks, Nurse. My name is Telemachus."
Bingo picks up a wooden block with two heart stickers on it.
Bingo: "This remote control makes the bed go up and down, Telemachus."
Bandit: "Oh, great!"
Bingo: "This one makes the legs go up..."
Bingo presses a button, and makes a buzzing sound with her mouth. Bandit lifts the head of the bed.
Bandit: "Ah!"
Bingo: "Oops, wrong button. Sorry, dear."
Bingo presses the other button, and makes more buzzing noises. The head of the bed goes down.
Bandit: "Ohh."
The foot of the bed lifts up suddenly.
Bandit: "Ah!"
Bingo giggles. She presses the button and buzzes once more, letting Bandit's legs down.
Bandit: "Whoah!"
Bingo puts a wooden thermometer in Bandit's mouth.
Bingo: "Now don't worry, we're going to make you feel all better."
Bandit: "Oh, good. I'm actually a bit nervous at hospitals."
Bingo: "There's no need to be nervous."
Bluey: "HELLO!"
Smash cut to a wider shot, showing Bluey standing at the foot of the bed. The thermometer flies from Bandit's mouth as they both jump.
Bingo, Bandit: "Aah!"
Bluey: "I'm the doctor."
Bluey kicks the thermometer away.
Bandit: "Oh, hello, Doctor. My name is—"
Bluey pokes Bandit in the arm with a wooden block.
Bluey: "Sting!"
Bandit: "Ouch!"
Bingo: "Oh, brave boy."
Bingo applies a plaster to Bandit's arm, and pats him consolingly.
Bandit: "What was that?!"
Bluey: "A needle. Now, what seems to be the matter?"
Bandit: "Why did you give me a needle before asking me what's the matter?"
Bluey: "Because I'm verrry busy. Now, what's up?"
Bandit: "Well, my belly hurts."
Bluey puts her stethoscope to Bandit's belly.
Bluey: "Have you got a baby in there?"
Bandit: "No, I don't think so."
Bluey: "Nurse, do an X-ray on the big blue guy, please. I think there's a baby in there."
Bingo: "Yes, Doctor."
Bingo runs off.
Bandit: "Hang on, I really don't think I have a—"
Bluey pokes Bandit with the block again.
Bluey: "Sting!"
Bandit: "Ouch!"
Bluey: "Bye!"
Bluey walks away. Bingo comes back with a shoebox.
Bandit: "Good grief! She certainly likes those needles."
Bingo: "Don't worry, sweetie. It's all to make you feel better. Now, time for your X-ray. Ready?"
Bandit nods as Bingo sets the shoebox on his belly.
Bingo: "Three, two, one. ERRRRN. X-ray!"
She runs over to a table and chair with drawing supplies.
Bingo: "X-ray'll be ready in a jiffy!"
Bandit: "Ah, good. I'll just relax..."
Bluey runs down the verandah, and dives to the floor, out of sight. A moment later, she pops up from behind Bandit, weilding the wooden block.
Bluey: "I'm back! Sting!"
She pricks Bandit again.
Bandit: "Yow! Bluey! I mean, Doctor. Can that be the last injection, please?"
Bluey pushes Bandit's head back onto the cushion.
Bluey: "Nope."
Bingo walks over with a marker drawing of Bandit.
Bingo: "Here's the X-ray, Doctor."
Bluey: "Oh, thank you. I'll just get this plaster off."
Bandit: "Huh?
Bluey rips off the plaster, taking some fur with it.
Bluey: "Rip!"
Bandit: "Ow!"
Bingo: (consolingly) "Brave boy."
Bingo passes the drawing to Bluey, then pats Bandit's head. Bluey holds the drawing up to the light, examining it.
Bluey: "Oh, well this does not look good. You see just here?"
Bluey points at the drawing. We see a close up of it. A yellow animal with a curly tail has been drawn inside Bandit's belly.
Bandit: "Oh, look. It's a... possum?"
Bluey: "Yes. You have a possum in your belly."
Bingo: "That's not a possum. It's a cat."
Bluey: "Oh yeah. You have a cat in your belly."
Bandit: "How did it get in there?"
Bingo: "Did you eat one?"
Bandit: "No!"
Bluey casually throws the drawing aside.
Bluey: "Well, no one really knows how cats get in your belly, but probably through your belly button?"
Bandit: "What? Really?"
Bluey leans on Bandit, causually examining her nails.
Bluey: "Yeah. Probably, they just set up a slide while you're asleep, and just slide right in, you know?"
Bandit: "My goodness."
Bluey: "We'll have to operate."
Bingo: "Yes, Doctor."
Bluey and Bingo run to Bandit's other side. Bluey pulls out an egg beater and starts cranking it.
Bandit: "Woah, hang on."
Bluey: "Let's do this. Here's a magazine to read."
She throws a magazine on Bandit's face. He grunts and removes it.
Bandit: "You mean you're not even going to put me to sleep first?"
Bluey: "Oh, yeah. I guess we could. Nurse, can you put this big blue guy to sleep, please?"
Bingo: "Yes, Doctor."
Bingo puts a birthday part hat over Bandit's muzzle. She strokes his head as she begins to sing.
Bingo: ♫ "Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, big Telemachus..." ♫
Bandit snores.
Bingo: "He's asleep!"
Bluey: "Oh, good, I can give him another needle! Sting!"
She pricks Bandit again, who "awakens" with a start.
Bandit: "OW! Bluey!"
Bluey: "You're meant to be asleep!"
Bandit: "No. More. Needles!"
Bluey: "Fine."
Bingo: ♫ "Go to sleep, go to sleep..." ♫
Bandit falls asleep again.
Bingo: (whispering) "He's asleep."
Bluey: "Okay, let's go!"
Bluey runs the egg beater over Bandit's belly, making whirring sounds as she does.
Bandit: "Oh! Oh! Ow!"
Bluey throws the egg beater aside and reaches "into" Bandit's belly.
Bluey: "Now, let's get this cat out!"
Something squeaks.
Bluey: "Oh, I think I got it! Urgh! Here, kitty! Ah!"
Bluey pulls out a squeaky stuffed octopus, and quickly begins to struggle with it.
Bingo: "Ah! That's not a cat! That's an octopus! Put it back in! I think it's supposed to be in there!"
Bluey attempts to shove the octopus back in.
Bluey: "Get back in, octopus! So many tentacles!"
Bingo: "Doctor, catch!"
Bingo throws Bluey the remote. Bluey then uses it to pound the octopus back in as it squeaks. Bandit grunts,.
Bluey: "Get. Back. In!"
The remote falls in with the octopus.
Bluey: "Aah! Bingo! It's got the remote! Let go!"
Bandit's bed begins to go haywire, lifting his head and legs at random. The stuffed octopus is still squeaking.
Bandit: "Woah!"
Bluey: "Hey! Let go! Hey, I see the cat! I see the cat! Nurse, give me something to whack it with."
Bingo: "Ok."
Bingo hands Bluey an inflatable hammer, which she uses to pound on Bandit's stomach, causing more squeaking from the octopus and more grunting from Bandit. Bingo comes over and shines a torch, helping Bluey see.
Bluey: "Oh, I've got his tail!"
Bingo: "Pull it!"
Bluey groans, then screams. She jerks her hands out of Bandit's stomach.
Bingo: "What happened?"
Bluey: "It bit me!"
Bingo: "Oh, you poor dear!"
Bingo puts a plaster on Bluey's hand.
Bluey: "That cat's not going anywhere!"
Bingo: "Oh, my."
Bluey: "Better wake the big blue guy and tell him."
Bingo: "You mean... we can't make him feel all better?"
Bluey: "Nope. Wake up, mate!"
Bluey pulls back the party hat, and then lets go, snapping it against Bandit's face.
Bandit: "OW! Bluey!"
She flicks the sleep mask, knocking it off Bandit's head.
Bluey: "Doctor Bluey."
Bandit: "Is the operation finished?"
Bluey: "Yeah. Sorry. There's nothing we can do. That cat just won't come out."
Bandit: "Oh. I see."
Bluey: "Now, I've got other patients. You're on your own."
Bluey sets down her clipboard and walks away.
Bandit: "What?"
Bluey: "See ya!"
Bluey waves and walks out of frame, and Bingo walks to Bandit's other side to comfort him.
Bandit: "Oh, I thought I was going to feel all better."
Bingo: "I'm sorry."
Bandit: "That's okay. You tried your best."
Bingo looks around sadly.
Bingo: "Hm..."
She brightens.
Bingo: "Leave it with me."
Bandit: "Okay, Nurse."
Bingo picks up the X-ray and takes it back to the drawing table. On the other side of the playroom, Bluey has set up several more cushions with stuffed animal patients. She is currently examining Polly Puppy with a stethoscope.
Bluey: "Hmm, yes. Those prickles will have to come out, I'm afraid."
Bingo walks up with the X-ray drawing.
Bingo: "Excuse me, Doctor..."
Bluey: "I'm very busy, Nurse."
Bingo: "I know, but can you look at this X-ray again?"
Bluey: "If it's from the big blue guy, there's really nothing I can do."
Bingo: "Just check it a bit closer."
Bluey: "Fine."
Bluey takes the X-ray and examines it as Bingo smiles excitedly. Bluey gasps.
Bluey: "Wait a minute! I didn't see this before!"
Back in the other part of the playroom, Bandit yawns and relaxes on his bed. Bluey walks over, startling Bandit.
Bluey: "Hello, big blue guy."
Bingo: "His name's Telemachus."
Bluey: "Something else has turned up on your X-ray, Telemachus."
Bandit: "Really?"
Bluey: "Look, here."
Bluey points at the X-ray, where Bingo has added another creature in Bandit's belly, this one in green marker.
Bandit: "Oh, it's a... pot plant?"
Bingo: "No, it's a mouse."
Bandit: "Ah. Of course. A mouse."
Bluey: "I think you swallowed a mouse."
Bingo: "And then the cat ran in after it!"
Bluey: "Because cats chase mice!"
Bandit: "Oh, goodness. What are you going to do?"
Bluey: "Hmm... What if we lured the mouse out?"
Bingo: "With some cheese!"
Bluey: "Then the cat would chase the mouse!"
Bandit: "Right out of my belly!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Cut to Bluey, holding Bandit's mouth open, while Bingo dangles a piece of toy cheese over Bandit's mouth with a stick and piece of string.
Bluey: "A little bit lower... a little bit lower..."
Bluey reaches down and pulls out a stuffed mouse.
Bluey: "There's the mouse!"
She pulls out a stuffed cat.
Bluey: "Rawr! And there's the cat!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Hooray!"
Bingo puts down the fishing rod and hugs the cat, and Bluey walks around Bandit.
Bingo: "Oh, good kitty."
Bluey: "How do you feel?
Bandit: "Hmm... I feel all better!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Hooray!"
They throw up their hands in celebration. Bingo tosses the cat up in the air.
Bandit: "Thanks, Doctor. And thank you, Nurse."
Bingo pats Bandit's head.
Bingo: "You're welcome."
Bandit: "Well, if that's that, I guess I'll be on my way."
Bandit stretches and gets up.
Bluey: "Oh, one more thing."
Bandit: "What's that?
Bluey pricks Bandit with the block yet again.
Bluey: "Sting!"
Bandit: "Ow!"
The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - an acapella groove. Bluey is dancing.
