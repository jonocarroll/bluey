(This episode starts at the upstairs balcony, where Bandit and Chilli are playing a game and Bluey is eating edamame beans. Pause as Bandit and Chilli contemplate their next move.)
Bandit: You know it's your turn?
Chilli: Yes, I know!
Bandit: Just checking.
Chilli: (sighing) Why do I always lose?
Bandit: You gotta play the long game.
(Bingo hops into frame and bumps into the table, knocking some of the game pieces over. Bandit sighs in exasperation and readjusts them.)
Bingo: Mum, can I have some of the pavlova that's in the fridge?
Chilli: No.
Bingo: Aw, but I'm hungry!
Chilli: Well, then have some edamame beans.
Bingo: Eda-whaty what?
Chilli: Edamame beans.
Bluey: They're from the sushi train. (pops a bean pod) Pop. (shows it to Bingo) They're yummy.
Bingo: No, thanks. I don't want an endamawie bean.
Chilli: You don't even wanna try it?
Bingo: Uh-uh.
Chilli: Well, then you can't be hungry.
Bingo: Aw!
Bluey: Ooh, Bingo, I know. Do you want to play café with me?
Bingo: No. I just want some pavlova.
Bluey: Well, then I really think you should come play café with me.
(She winks slowly at her sister.)
Bingo: Ooh, OK.
(The kids giggle as they hop off.)
Chilli: You'd better get on that.
Bandit: On it.
(Cue title card.)
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called... PAVLOVA!
(In the kitchen, the girls set up their café. Bluey sets the carpet on the counter, Bingo draws a slice of pavlova, and Bluey tapes the drawing. Bingo comes in as Bluey sets up a cashier on the counter.)
Bluey: (clears throat) Hello.
Bingo: Hello.
Bluey: Would you like to come to my café?
Bingo: Why, yes, I would. (giggles)
(Bluey hands Bingo the drawing.)
Bluey: Please look at our menu and let me know what you want.
(It's pavlova.)
Bingo: Hmm... Pavlova, please.
Bluey: Certainly! 
(She walks over to the fridge, not knowing that Bandit, now in full chef gear and now holding a frying pan and a spoon, is blocking the way.)
Bluey: That will be ready in a jiffy.
(She bumps into Bandit.)
Bluey: Hey. Oh, uh, excuse me.
Bandit: Bonjour.
Bluey: Huh?
Bandit: (tapping his utensils together) Bonjour!
Bingo: I think he wants to be the chef.
Bluey: Uh, no, Dad, we don't need you as chef. You can go back outside and play the game with the little men.
(Bluey finds herself blocked by Bandit, who really insists that he wants to be chef. Bluey tries to push him off, to no avail.)
Bluey: Okay, fine! You can work here.
Bandit: Supér! (Hooray!)
Bluey: I need you to get one piece of pavlova.
Bandit: Pav...lova?
Bluey: Yeah, pavlova! From the fridge!
(Bandit instead takes a magnet and hands it to her.)
Bandit: Pavlova?
Bluey: (giggles) No, that's a magnet! In the fridge!
(Bluey opens the fridge.)
Bluey: See?
Bandit: Ah-ha! Pavlova.
Bluey: Yes, pavlova. Give to customer.
Bandit: Bonjour. (he gives two thumbs up)
(Bluey narrows her eyes at the chef. She is soon led away by the chef.)
Bandit: Bonjour! Bonjour!
Bluey: Sorry about this, customer. Your pavlova will be right out. Our new chef is just getting it.
(Indeed, Bandit has arrived with the pavlo- edmadame beans.)
Bandit: (clears throat) Bonjour, pavlova!
(He sets the "pavlova" on the counter.)
Bluey: Hey!
Bingo: This isn't pavlova!
Bluey: Yeah, this isn't pavlova!
Bandit: Je suis le chien!
Bluey: These are edma-damee beans!
Bandit: Euh, oui?
Bluey: Edna-damee beans!
Bandit: Où est la discothèque?!
(Back at the fridge...)
Bluey: (pointing to the pavlova) I was pointing there, see? Pavlova!
Bandit: Ah. Gare du Nord! Pavlova!
Bluey: Yes!
Bandit: (pointing to the beans) Beans.
Bluey: Yes. That's beans. But we don't want beans. We want pavlova. OK?
Bandit: C'est bon. (That's alright)
(Bluey narrows her eyes again. She returns to the counter.)
Bluey: (sighing in annoyance) So sorry, customer. He's new.
Bingo: (giggling) That's OK.
(Bandit now returns with the plate of pav. For real life, this time.)
Bandit: C'est combien pavlova! (How much pavlova is!)
Bingo: (squealing and giggling)
(Well, not for real life. There is no pavlova.)
Bluey: What?! Where's the pavlova?!
Bandit: Écoutez! Pavlova.
(The pavlova is small - or rather it's a crumb.)
Bingo: (giggles) That's a crumb!
Bluey: (groaning in further annoyance) It's too small!
Bandit: Où est mon passeport?!
(Bluey hands the plate back to him.)
Bluey: Go back and get a piece that's this big. (showing it physically with her arms) See? THIS big!
Bandit: (rolling his eyes) Oh, bonjour!
Bluey: Please, bear with me.
Bingo: Hehe, that's OK.
(Now Bandit returns with a proper slice of pavlova.)
Bandit: Bonjour pavlova. (He pulls out a tape measure and measures the length of the slice) ...où la discothèque?
Bluey: Yes. Thank you. It's a good size.
(Bandit lets the tape measure wind itself back. He offers a spoon to Bingo.)
Bandit: Bonjour.
Bingo: Thank you.
(Bingo is finally about to eat her first slice of pavl- Bandit pulls out a tomato sauce and squirts it all over the pav before Bingo could eat it. Oops.)
Bluey and Bingo: Ah! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
Bandit: Je veux la fenêtre!
Bluey: You don't put tomato sauce on pavlova!
Bandit: Je veux la fenêtre.
Bluey: That's it. (hops off the stool) You're outta here.
Bandit: Oh, bonjour?!
Bluey: Out!
(Now fired, Bandit tosses down his chef hat and storms away.)
Bandit: Oh, bonjour! Un champ pour deux poissons!
(Bluey returns to the table, chef hat on her head.)
Bluey: I know exactly what he was trying to do - he was trying to stop YOU from eating pavlova.
Bingo: (giggling) I like his funny talk.
Bluey: Well, he can funny-talk somewhere else! I've got a café to run. Now, let me sort out that pavlova.
(Bluey picks up the tomato-lova and sauce bottle; she enters the fridge and eyes the pavlova:)
Bluey: Bonjour! (Hello.)
(Bluey returns with the entire pavlova as...)
Bingo: Psst! Bluey!
Bluey: Yeah?
(Bingo points towards something - which is Bandit setting up his own café using the dining table.)
Bandit: (humming) Où est la discothèque?
Bluey: Hey! You can't open a café right next to mine!
Bandit: A-bonjour!
(Bingo gets off the high stool and starts walking towards the Bandit café.)
Bluey: Where are you going?
Bingo: I just want to see the menu.
Bluey: Well, don't be long. Your pavlova's coming.
(Bingo enters.)
Bandit: Au revoir!
Bingo: Can I see a menu, please?
Bandit: Mercredi!
(He hands her the menu - today's special: edamame beans.)
Bluey: What's it got on it?
Bingo: It's only got endabolly beans.
Bluey: Ha! Well, she doesn't want them. She wants pavlova.
Bandit: Oh-ho! (showing the technique) No-ho-ho. Mmm. Uh-huh. Oh, ouais. Ouais, ouais, ouais...
Bingo: I think he's saying he puts some lovely things on them to make them taste nice.
Bandit: A-bonjour.
Bingo: Um...it's just that... I really think I want pavlova.
(Bandit is now downcast.)
Bandit: Aw... Très bon.
(Beat - Bingo notices the saddened expression on Bandit's face and compromises...)
Bingo: Well... you can make me some endamommy beans, if you want.
Bandit: Très malade!
(He starts to get off the chair-)
Bingo: But I get to choose if I want to eat them or the pavlova.
(Now he knows.)
Bandit: Hmm...
Bingo: It's just... I don't like it when you make me eat something.
Bandit: Mon petit chou à la crème.
Bluey: It's a café competition! I'm gonna get the sprinkles.
(Bingo is excited, for her tail wags to and fro! Cue montage of the two preparing their dishes - Bluey adds more fruit into the pav, Bandit pops an edamame pod, and the wayward bean boops Bluey on her nose before it falls into the pav...)
Bluey: Hey!
(Bingo giggles as Bluey once again narrows her eyes at Bandit.)
Bandit: Oh, bonjour.
Bingo: Can I help?
(He hands her the plate of bean pods.)
Bandit: Je suis désolé.
Bingo: Pop!
(She pops the bean, and Bandit catches it in a pan.)
Bingo: Hooray!
Bandit: Saint-Tropez!
(Bluey adds sprinkles to a slice, and Bandit salt. Bluey adds a finishing touch...)
Bluey: Ready!
(...and Bandit lemons.)
Bandit: Bonjour.
(Bingo now takes a hard look at her options - Bluey's slice, or Bandit's beans.)
Bingo: Hmm... Hmm... OK. I've decided. Pavlova!
Bluey: Hooray!
Bandit: C'est croissant, s'il vous plait!
(Bingo returns to her seat.)
Bingo: So... I can eat this?
Bandit: Bonjour.
(He hands her two thumbs-up once again. Bingo giggles as she finally tastes her first slice of pav - and she enjoys it! Bandit turns to Bluey...)
Bandit: Tu es une morve. (You are a snot)
(He shakes hands with Bluey.)
Bluey: Thank you.
Chilli: You know he just called you a booger?
Bluey: What?! How very dare you?!
Bandit: Comment allez-vous?
(Bandit runs off, with Bluey in hot pursuit. Chilli looks at her youngest, finishing up the pav.)
Bingo: Dad said I could!
Chilli: I know. I guess I have to trust he knows what he's doing.
(Speaking of Bandit, let's check up on him: he's still being chased by Bluey.)
Bandit: Oh... Je suis un chien! (Oh... I am the dog!)
Bluey: How dare you call me a booger!
Bingo: Yum. (picks up a pod) Hey, Mum, look at this. Pop.
(She pops an edamame bean pod, and a bean flies into the plate.)
Chilli: Whoa! (laughing) Good shot. Come on, let's find your dad. It's his turn.
Bingo: OK, Mama.
(Bingo gets off the table, beat - she comes back to the table, then tries the edamame bean.)
Bingo: Mmm...! (She likes it!)
