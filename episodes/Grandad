The episode opens with a rolling shot of the outbacks.
Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo are riding in the car while Bluey and Bingo are eating.
Chilli: Make sure you eat your pumpkin seeds, Bluey. I want you to grow up big and strong.
Bluey: Aw! I don't want to grow up big and strong.
Chilli: Too bad.
Bluey: Shouldn't it be up to me?
Chilli: If it was up to you, would you eat them?
Bluey: No.
Chilli: Then no, it shouldn't be up to you.
Bluey: Aww! 
Bingo: When we get to Grandad's, can he take us in his canoe?
Chilli: No, honey. Grandad's just had a heartworm, the doctor says he needs to rest. 
Chilli stops at the front yard to a sight of Mort actively trying to find a good spot to uproot a tree stump with a digging bar.
Bluey & Bingo: Grandad!
Chilli: Dad! What are you doing?!
Mort: Oh, strewth! Quick, run kids!
Bluey and Bingo jump out of the car and run away with Mort, exiting the scene to the right towards the backyard.
Chilli: You're meant to be resting!
Chilli gets out of the car.
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called "Grandad".
Cut to a tracking shot of the runaway pups and Mort howling with the family house in background.
Bingo: Aren't you meant to be resting Grandad?
Mort: Ah, there's nothing wrong with me. 
Chilli: You get in bed now!
Mort: You'll have to catch me first!
Bluey & Bingo: Yeah, you have to catch us first!
Mort stops at the water tower and turns on the sprinkler, spraying Chilli and slowing her down.
Mort and pups while having a good laugh arrive to the edge of the backyard.
Mort: We gotta head bush, kids!
Mort and the kids run up a slope into the forest.
(offscreen) Chilli: Get back here!
Bluey : Oh no, she's following us.
Mort:: Quick, hide!
Chilli runs into the forest.
Chilli: Where are those cheeky dogs? 
Mort and the kids are hiding under some tree roots.
Chilli: (Shouting) No one knows this scrub better than me!
Mort: Oh that's true: This is where she grew up. 
Chilli: I will find you!
Bluey: Grandad, I've got a plan.
Bluey whispers in Mort's ear.
Mort: I didn't hear any of that.
Bluey rolls her eyes and throws a rock to distract Chilli.
Chilli: Ooh, they're over here. 
Chilli runs after the rock and disappears from the scene.
Bluey: She's gone. 
Mort: Nice work Bluey. 
Bluey: Where should we go?
Bingo: To the canoes!
Mort: Oh good idea, Bingo. Come on, we'll follow the creek.
Mort and the kids go down a steep slope.
Bluey: Come on, Grandad.
Bluey and Bingo easily go down while Mort struggles.
Mort: Yeah, yeah; just guarding our rear from a sneak attack. I'll show you a trick I learned in the jungle. 
Mort covers his face in mud from the creek.
Mort: She can't find what she can't see. (laughs)
Bluey & Bingo: (giggle) Wow! Good idea, Grandad!
Bluey and Bingo cover their faces with mud.
They all continue running upstream with Mort getting slower and panting.
Bluey: Are you sure you're okay, Grandad?
Mort: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Bingo: Is it much longer until the canoes? I'm hungry. 
Bluey: Yeah, me too. Do you have any food?
Mort: Do I have food? Follow me. 
Mort and the kids climb up from the creek.
 And right after, Chilli drops down next to the mud bath spot. Having noticed how there is dirt floating in the creek, she makes her trademark glaring Mum-face towards upstream which she starts running along with.
Cut to Mort is uncovering a hidden backpack on a hilltop.
Bluey: Grandad, why did you bury a backpack?
Mort: In case you need some food!
Bluey & Bingo: Hurray!
Cut back to Chilli in the creek.
Chilli almost almost runs past the slope Mort and pups had climbed up a moment earlier before back pedalling due noticing some blue and red fur on a tree root at the foot of the slope.
Chilli then climbs up the slope.
Cut back to Mort is struggling to open a bag of nuts.
Mort: Urgh, come on!
Bluey: Do you want me to do it, Grandad?
Mort: Okay, my thumbs play up a bit these days. 
Bluey: Is that why Mum wants you to rest? So your thumbs get better?
Mort: Yeah, probably.
Bingo: Then why don't you?
Mort: Well, it should be up to me - they're my thumbs.
Bluey: Yes, it should.
Mort pulls out a bag of pumpkin seeds.
Mort: Here, Bluey. Have some pumpkin seeds. 
Bluey: No thanks.
Mort: You gotta eat your pumpkin seeds, kid. They'll make you big and strong. 
Bluey: That's what Mum said. 
Mort: Well your Mum's right. 
Bluey: But, shouldn't it be up to me? 
Mort frowns a little having noticed his own hypocrisy.
Bingo: I'll eat my pumpkin seeds. I want to be big and strong so I can paddle the canoe. 
The view zooms out.
Chilli is standing at the foot of the hill MOrt and pups and sitting atop of.
Chilli: Ha! There you are!
 Chilli starts running up the hill.
Mort, Bluey & Bingo: Ah!
Mort: She's found us! Run, kids!
Mort puts the food in the bag and dons the backpack as he runs off with Bluey and Bingo.
Chilli: You're not meant to be running around!
Mort: The canoe's down this way!
Mort and pups arrive to a fork in the path and stop.
Mort: Ah, now hang on - did I lend to Maynard?
Bluey: Come on, Grandad, she's coming!
Mort: Oh I can't remember. We'll just go this way.
They run along up the path and to a lakeside shack where Maynard is fishing at. 
Maynard: 'Hey, what's going on?!
Mort climbs up to veranda to keep look out for Chilli. 
Bluey: Hi, Maynard. 
Maynard: Hey kids!
Mort: Maynard! You've got to hide us!
Maynard stands up a little and pokes his out of veranda glancing towards the sky.
Maynard: Is it the aliens?!
Mort: No, it's Chilli.
Bluey: Grandad won't do what Mum tells him to. 
Maynard: Oh, why don't you just do what you're told? 
Mort: Oh, don't you start. Just hide us.
Maynard: Okay come on, quickly. Come in the back.
Maynard opens the door to the fishing shack, letting Mort and the kids in.
Bingo: Have you got Grandad's canoe, Maynard?
(offscreen far away) Chilli: Here I come!
(offscreen) Bluey: Bingo, come on!
Chilli runs up to the fishing shack.
Maynard moves his chair to block the entrance door.
Maynard: (nervously) Oh-oh, Chilli! Fancy seeing you here. 
Chilli: Can it, Maynard. Where are they?
Maynard: Um, where's who?
Chilli: You know who!
Maynard: Um...
Cut inside the fishing equipment storage of the shack where Mort and pups are huddling in.
(offscreen) Maynard: ...did you get a haircut? 
Mort: Come on, Maynard. Keep it together. 
(offscreen, muffled, overlaid) Chilli: Really?..I didn't got it. 
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Cut back to veranda with Maynard still sitting on his chair blocking the front entrance door and Chilli climbing up the stairs.
Chilli: He has to accept that he's getting older and needs to look after himself. 
Maynard: Well if he was here, he'd just say (imitating Mort) "Shouldn't it be up to me?"
Chilli: No it shouldn't! I'm his daughter! He should take care of himself for me because...I still need him.
Cut back to pups and Mort who seems to have taken words of Chilli into his heart.
Cut back to the veranda.
Maynard: Well, only an old fool would ignore that!
Maynard's fishing rod jumps a little.
Chilli: Ooh, is that a bite, Maynard?
Cut back to storage room.
Mort: Oh, we're cooked, kids!
 Cut back to the veranda.
Chilli: I think that is a bite. (lowered) It could be a barra.
Maynard: Oh yeah, that's definitely a barra.
After a brief quiet moment, the fishing rod suddenly get yanked into lake and Maynard rushes after it.
Maynard: Aagh! I got it, I got it, I got it!
Chilli moves the chair which was blocking the front door.
 Mort and pups exit through the back door onto to the pier.
Mort: You had one job, Maynard!
Chilli: You!
Mort: Run, kids!
Bluey: Where?!
The view changes between frontal close-up view of Bingo and her noticing the canoe end of the pier with three life jackets left conveniently left there.
Bingo: Canoe! (giggles)
Bluey: Yaah!
Mort and pups runs towards the canoe and Chilli climbs over the veranda railing landing on the pier.
Chilli: Don't you ever quit?!
Bluey: Run, Grandad!
Mort: I am running!
Chilli: Get back here!
The pups put on life-vests and jump into the canoe. Mort grabs the last life-vest, unties the rope holding the canoe and then jumps in the canoe themselves off from the pier.
Chilli having barely missed her lunge onto Mort, tippy-toes to regain her balance at the edge of the pier.
Mort: Wo-hoo! We got away!
Bluey and Bingo: Hurray!
Chilli jumps into water and swims after the fugitives,
Mort has just finished putting on his life-vest.
Mort: Don't you ever quit?!
Bluey: What are we gonna do?
Bingo picks up a paddle.
Bingo: We canooooe!!!
Bluey: Paddle, Grandad!
Mort: I can't - my thumbs! You kids will have to do it.
Bluey: This is why you have to rest!
Mort: Well, this is why you have to be big and strong!!!
Bluey: She's catching up!
Bingo: Canooooooe!
 Bluey and Bingo: Canooooooe! Canooooooe!
Mort: That's it, girls! We're doing it! Yeah! We got away!
Chilli: I'll find you!
Mort: Whoo-hoo!
Cut to other side of the lake where pups and Mort park their canoe next to a pier.
Bluey: That was fun!
Mort: Yeah, I could've used you kids with me in the jungle.
Bingo: Will Mum find us here?
Mort: Yeah, she'll be here soon, I reckon.
Cut to Chilli where we follow running through the scrub.
(offscreen) Mort: This was her favourite place when she was young.
Cut back to the favourite pier.
Bluey: Where should we go?!
Bingo: Should we get back in the canoe?
Mort: Naaah...I think it's time I had a rest. Why don't you kids have a swim?
Bluey and Bingo: Yes, swim!
Cut back to Chilli who soon arrives to the pier to observe Mort and pups.
Bluey: Hey Grandad, watch me!
(offscreen) Mort: Oh, good one, Bluey!
Cut back to the pier.
Mort: That's the way, Bingo!
Mort laughs heartily while Chilli walks to him from behind.
Chilli: Caught you.
Mort: I knew you would.
Bluey: Mum, look - I'm eating my pumpkin seeds!
Chilli: Hurray!
Bingo: And Grandad's resting!
Chilli: ...hurray.
The view changes behind Chilli and Mort with the sun starting to set.
Chilli: I remember when you used to take me swimming here.
Mort: Yeah, me too.
Chilli: That was a long time ago.
Mort: No...it was yesterday.
Chilli turns into her younger puppy self, leaning towards Mort.
