Bingo: "Where are we going?"
Chilli: "We're dropping you kids at Nana's remember?"
Bluey and Bingo in unison: "Hooray! TV!"
Bandit: "No TV."
Bluey: "But why not?"
Bandit: "Cause you've been watching it all morning!"
Bluey: "But what are we meant to do?"
Bandit: "I don't know, use your imagination and draw some pictures."
Bluey: "I don't know what to draw?"
Chilli: "Oh nonsense."
Bluey: "Don't worry Bingo, Nana will let us watch TV!"
Chilli: "I heard that."
Bluey: "Hey hang on, why aren't you coming to Nanas?"
Chilli: "Because you and your dad want to spend some time together!"
Bluey: "What?! Without us?"
Bandit: "Yea, hard to believe isn't it?"
Bluey: "What are you gonna do?"
Bandit: "Well were gonna lie in comfy hammocks wearing sunglasses!"
From this point, it will switch through drawings and back in the car within this point.
Chilli: "Drinking from coconuts with those little umbrellas."
