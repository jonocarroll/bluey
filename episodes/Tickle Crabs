The episode begins in the living room with Bandit and Chilli on the couch. Bandit tosses a pillow in the air and Chilli is trying to fix a doll with gum in its hair.
Bandit: It has been 10 minutes since a kid has run in here and asked me a question.
Bluey runs into the living room.
Bluey: Dad?
Bandit: Yeah, mate?
Bluey: Can we get married?
Bandit: Nah.
Bluey: Why not?
Bandit: I'm already married to your mum.
Bluey: Because she's your true love?
Bandit: Yes, because she's my true love.
Bluey: Is it nice having a true love?
Bandit: It's very nice having a true love.
Bluey: What's so nice about having a true love?
Bandit: Hmm. Well, they're always there for you when you need them.
Bingo enters the living room.
Bingo: Let's play Tickle Crabs!
Bluey: Yeah, Tickle Crabs!
Chilli gets up and runs away.
Chilli: See you later!
TITLE CARD: TICKLECRABS
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called "Tick-" (the title card is abruptly interrupted)
The scene changes back to the living room
Bandit: Uh-uh. No way. I am not playing Tickle Crabs.
Bluey: Aw, why not?
Bandit: 'Cause I hate Tickle Crabs.
Bluey: Why?
Bandit: Because you're Tickle Crabs!
Bluey and Bingo briefly giggle.
Bluey: Yeah, but that's the fun part.
Bandit: Fun for you, maybe. Not for me.
The camera zooms in on Bluey and Bingo.
Bluey: Okay, Bingo, this is going to take a serious please face.
Bingo: Yes, serious.
Bluey: Let's get these ears back. (she folds back Bingo's ears) And I'm going to need to see tears. (Bingo now has tears in her eyes) That's good. And let's hold these. (she gives Bingo an octopus and dog toy; the toys squeak as she gives them to Bingo) Okay, let's do this.
The scene changes back to Bandit on the couch. Bluey and Bingo walk up to Bandit. Bluey clears her throat.
Bandit: What do you want?
The camera zooms in on Bluey and Bingo. Bingo whimpers as Bluey speaks; the camera focuses on Bluey or Bandit when either one of them speak.
Bluey: Why do you never play with us?
Bandit: What?!
Bluey: You're always at work.
Bandit: I'm never at work!
Bluey: It's like you don't even love us.
Bandit: You are joking, right?
Bluey: How can you not love your own children?
Bandit: Aw, cheese and jam! Alright.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray! (they both giggle as they run away)
Bandit: That was impressive.
TITLE CARD: TICKLECRABS
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called, "Tickle Crabs".
The scene cuts to Bandit on the deck in the backyard lying on a beach towel.
Bandit: (he sits up) Oh, what a wonderful day at the beach. A little bit lonely, of course, but wonderful. (shouting towards the inside of the house) It would be better if I had a true love to share it with! (he stands up and walks towards the house) Perhaps one day I'll find her. Oh, well, now it's time to go back to my empty house. (Bluey and Bingo walk like crabs and hide underneath Bandit's beach towel) I'll just turn around and pick up my towel. (he picks up the beach towel with Bluey and Bingo inside. As he picks up the towel, Bluey and Bingo giggle) Now I'll just shake the sand off. (he shakes the towel) Now off home.
The scene changes to the car. Bandit pretends to drive home, making engine noises with his mouth.
Bandit: (singing to the tune of Oh My Darling, Clementine) Oh, where are you, my true love? Won't you come to me? (Bluey and Bingo emerge from the beach towel in the backseat of the car, wiggling their fingers. They both giggle)
The scene changes back to the living room. Bandit carries the beach towel with Bluey and Bingo inside.
Bandit: Ah, home sweet, lonely home. (he puts the beach towel with Bluey and Bingo on the floor. Bluey and Bingo giggle. Bandit gets on the couch) Ah, well, time for a nap. Perchance I will dream of meeting my true love. (he pretends to fall asleep)
As Bandit is pretending to sleep on the couch, Bluey and Bingo get out of the beach towel, walking like crabs while whispering "tickle". They tickle Bandit's feet.
Bluey and Bingo: Tickle!
Bandit is awakened from his pretend nap laughing. Bluey and Bingo hide behind the couch.
Bandit: What was that? (Bluey and Bingo giggle) Hm, I must have dreamt of being tickled. Oh well, I might just give this big soft belly a bit of air. (he lays back down and rubs his belly and pretends to fall back asleep)
Bluey and Bingo's hands emerge from behind the couch. They tickle Bandit's belly.
Bluey and Bingo: Tickle!
Bandit is again awakened from his pretend nap laughing.
Bandit: Oh no, Tickle Crabs! I must have brought them back from the beach with me.
Bluey and Bingo jump onto Bandit and tickle him. Bandit laughs as Bluey and Bingo repeatedly say "tickle". Bandit falls onto the floor and runs away screaming.
Bluey and Bingo: Tickle, tickle!
The scene changes to the kitchen. Bandit climbs onto the kitchen bench. Bluey and Bingo follow him while saying "tickle".
Bandit: You can't get me up here, Tickle Crabs! (Bluey grabs a step stool and uses it to climb onto the kitchen bench) Hey! What? No! (he throws grapes and Bluey and Bingo) These Tickle Crabs are smart! (he raises his voice) If only I had a true love to come to my rescue! (the music and Bluey and Bingo briefly stops, then resumes) I've got to make a break for it! Freedom! (he jumps off the kitchen bench, hurting himself) Ow! (he limps away while holding his left leg)
The scene changes to a corridor.
Bandit: Hang on, I'll use this glue (pretends to pick up glue from the floor; he hides behind a cupboard in the corridor. Bluey and Bingo enter the corridor while saying "tickle") Got ya! (he grabs Bluey and pretends to glue her back to the wall) Glue, glue, glue. Stick! (he grabs Bingo and pretends to glue her back to the wall too) Glue, glue, glue. Stick! (Bluey and Bingo wiggle their fingers while saying "Tickle") Well, that seems to have done it. Ooh, you want some of these big juicy ribs? (the camera zooms close to Bandit's ribs and the kid's fingers) Ooh, yeah, they look nice to tickle, don't they?
Bluey and Bingo pretend to unglue themselves from the wall.
Bluey: Unglue, unglue, unglue.
They both pop from the wall.
Bluey and Bingo: Tickle!
Bandit: (laughs) Ah, true love, are you out there? (laughs) I could really use you right now to come and have your turn with these Tickle Crabs. (to Bluey and Bingo) Hey (laughs) that's enough! Time out! (he runs into the cupboard in the corridor. Inside the cupboard, he sighs in relief. He discovers that Chilli has been hiding inside the cupboard) (to Chilli) Hey, what are you doing in here?
Chilli: Hiding. There's no way I'm getting tickled.
Bandit: Well, it's nice to meet you. My name is Telemachus and I'm looking for my true love who's supposed to always be there for me to come and help me with these crabs. But she hasn't turned up.
Chilli: That sounds like hard work.
Bandit: How so?
Chilli: Well, your true love probably has her own problems.
Bandit: Hm, I never thought of that. I guess the first thing I do is yell out for help when I'm... (Chilli interrupts him and runs away)
Chilli: Good luck!
Bandit: Hey!
Bluey and Bingo begin to tickle Bandit.
Bandit: That is it! (laughs) That lady was right. From now on, I'll solve my own problems. (laughs) You Tickle Crabs are going back to where you came from!
The scene cuts to the car. Bandit walks up to the car while holding Bluey and Bingo.
Bandit: Just gotta take the hits! (he puts Bluey and Bingo in the backseat)
The scene cuts to the inside of the car. Bluey and Bingo tickle Bandit as Bandit pretends to drive. Bandit laughs.
The scene cuts to the deck in the backyard. Bandit carries Bluey and Bingo to the deck.
Bandit: Now I'll just (laughs) throw them back (laughs) into the sea! (he throws Bluey and Bingo. Bluey and Bingo scream as they go away from the deck) Oh, and a big wave takes them out to sea. I did it! I got rid of those tickling crabs. Ahh! The air tastes fresher. Birdsong's sweeter.
The camera focuses on flying cockatoos, a butterfly, and a bee.
Bandit: I'm free at last!
When Bluey and Bingo reach the back of the backyard, they rush back to the house.
Bluey: Oh, but a wave washes them back in!
Bandit: Wait, what? No, hey, no! Get away!
Bluey and Bingo jump onto Bandit and tickle him.
Bluey and Bingo: Tickle!
Bandit: Oh, well, let it end then, on this (laughs) beautiful day (laughs) alone but (laughs) no longer lonely. (laughs)
The toy that Chilli has been fixing suddenly falls onto the deck; the toy squeaks when it hits the deck.
Bandit: Huh?
Chilli sits in the tree above the deck; she squawks like a seagull.
Bandit: A seagull!
Chilli jumps out of the tree and grabs Bingo and squawks.
Bandit: The most beautiful seagull I've ever seen!
Bluey runs away screaming. Chilli runs after her and grabs her.
Bandit: Oh beautiful seagull, are you my true love?
Chilli gives three short squawk.
Bandit: Oh, I'm so happy! Farewell! We shall meet again! I will always be there for you, for you are my true love. But I just need half an hour on the couch. See ya!
The camera pans towards the sky.
End credits.
