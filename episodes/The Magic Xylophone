The episode opens with a view of the Heeler home. Bandit can be heard clearing his voice. In the playroom, Bingo and Bandit are sitting on the kiwi rug, facing each other. Bluey lays across Bandit's lap.
Bandit: "Ladies and gentlemen, I will now play for you... the Rondo Alla Turca."
Bandit cracks his knuckles and clears his throat as Bluey giggles. Then he starts tickling and poking her all over, vocalizing the third movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11 as Bluey giggles and fidgets. Bluey snorts and manages to flee, but Bandit tries to hold her down, getting dragged as she continues to crawl.
Bandit: "Hey! Piano! Ugh! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm terribly sorry, I seem to be having a little bit of trouble with my piano!"
Bandit finally gets Bluey back onto his lap and continues playing as Bluey squirms and giggles. Bingo stands up.
Bingo: "Dad! I want to be the piano."
Bluey: "No, it's still my turn."
Bandit: "Taking turns can be difficult."
Bingo: "Dad, she's had this many turns."
Bingo holds up five fingers and a foot.
Bandit: "You can be the bum bongos!"
Bandit puts Bluey aside, picks Bingo up, lies her across his lap, and begins drumming her bottom, while vocalizing bongo sounds. 
Bandit: ♫ "Bum badumda bum, bum bongos!" ♫
Bluey starts to dance as Bingo giggles.
Bandit: ♫ "Bum badumda bum, bum bongos! Bum badumda bum, bum bongos! Bum badumda bum, bum bongos! Bum badumda bum..." ♫
Chilli walks in.
Chilli: "Ooh! Island rhythms!"
Chilli joins in dancing. Bandit continues to play the bum bongos as Bingo laughs and Chilli and Bluey dance.
Bandit: ♫ "Bum badumda bum, bum bongos!" ♫
TITLE CARD - The Magic Xylophone
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: The Magic Xylophone!"
Back in the playroom, Bandit does leg lifts while Bluey clings to his leg. Meanwhile, Bingo is looking in a bag full of musical instruments.
Bingo: "Where are the real bongos?"
Bingo gasps at something inside the bucket and digs it out. She holds up a toy xylophone for everyone in the room to see.
Bingo: "Bluey! Look!"
Bandit: "Huh? Oh no! The—"
Bandit attempts to run, but Bluey grabs his leg and pulls him down.
Bluey: "Quick, Bingo!"
Bandit: "Let me up!"
Bluey: "Get the dinger thing!"
Bandit: "Let me up! Let me out of here! Aaah!"
Bingo manages to dig out the mallet.
Bingo: "Got it!"
Bluey: "Do a ding!"
Bingo: "Freeze!"
Bingo dings the xylophone with the mallet. Bandit freezes in place.
Bandit: "Y—"
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah! The Magic Xylophone!"
Giggling, Bluey and Bingo adjust Bandit's arms and mouth so that he's smiling with a thumbs up while picking his nose. Chilli walks by on the verandah, buckling a leather bag.
Bluey: "Mum, come look at this!"
Chilli: "Oh, look! It's just like when we first met."
Bluey picks up the Magic Xylophone and the mallet.
Bluey: "Unfreeze!"
She dings the xylophone. Bandit unfreezes, and Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "What?! How did I get fingers up my nose? Oh. The Magic Xylophone!"
He removes the finger from his nose.
Bandit: "Gimme that xylophone!"
Bandit attempts to chase Bluey.
Bluey: "Freeze!
Bandit: "Give me that—"
She dings the xylophone. Bandit freezes again. Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bluey: "Bingo! Let's get the pens!"
Bluey and Bingo drag chairs from the dining room, both giggling. Back in the playroom, Bluey stands on a chair so she can reach Bandit's face. She draws glasses, eyelashes, and a moustache on Bandit's face with purple pen.
Bluey: (fancy voice) "Oh, what a splendid moustache you have!"
By now, Bandit is wearing a deer antler hat, and a sock on his tail. Bingo wraps a feather boa around his shoulders.
Bingo: (fancy voice) "Ooh, lovely."
Bluey and Bingo walk in front of Bandit. Bingo lightly grabs the mallet.
Bingo: "It's my turn to unfreeze him."
Bluey ignores Bingo, making her look sad.
Bluey: "Unfreeze!"
Bluey dings the xylophone. Bandit stumbles and the kids squeal.
Bandit: "What?! Argh, you kids! Grr!"
Bluey: "Run!"
Bandit chases the kids out the front door and down the front path.
Bandit: "Give me that magic xylophone!"
Bandit catches up and grabs Bluey.
Bandit: "Gotcha!"
Bluey screams as she's caught, then dings the xylophone. Bandit freezes.
Bandit: "D'ah..."
Bluey: (taunting) "Ya-ha, too slow, Mr Moustache!"
Bingo: "Bluey, you're taking all the turns freezing."
Bluey: "Come on, Bingo. Let's get the teddies!"
Bingo: (resigned) "Okay..."
Bluey and Bingo run off, leaving Bandit frozen in place. Chloe's Mum walks by with a stroller. She slows down while passing by him, then hurries away. Bluey and Bingo return, putting soft toys in Bandit's arms while giggling. Chilli walks over with her bag.
Chilli: "I'm off to work!"
Bluey: "Mum! Mum! Look at Dad now!"
Chilli examines Bandit and spots a loose eyebrow hair.
Chilli: "This loose hair's been bugging me all morning."
Chilli plucks out one of Bandit's loose eyebrow hairs, making him flinch and whimper. She then kisses Bandit on the cheek, pats him, and heads for the car.
Bluey: "Okay, I'll unfreeze him."
Bingo: "I wanna do it. Mum, Bluey's not letting me have any turns."
Chilli: "Bluey, if you don't take turns with people, people won't take turns with you."
Bluey: "But Bingo is too slow. Dad will catch her."
Bingo: "No, I'm not."
Chilli: "You can either take turns, or I'll bring the xylophone to work with me. I'll freeze my boss."
Bluey, Bingo: "No!"
Bandit: "Nnnn! Nnnn!"
Chilli: "Well, you know what to do, then. I'll see you later. Just make sure you unfreeze him for toilet breaks, okay?"
Bluey, Bingo: "Okay!"
Chilli drives off and honks the horn. Bluey gives Bingo the xylophone and guides her to stand a few metres behind Bandit.
Bluey: "Here, Bingo. But stand right back here. That way you can get a head start. He runs really fast when he's mad."
Bingo: "Okay. Unfreeze!"
Bingo dings the xylophone. Bandit throws the teddies up into the air, confused, before spotting Bingo and Bluey giggling behind him.
Bandit: "Ohh! There you are! Grrr!"
Bluey: "Run, Bingo! Back inside!"
Bandit chases Bluey and Bingo back up the front steps, and then into the kids' bedroom.
Bandit: (off screen) Bingo! Bluey! Come back here!"
Bingo and Bluey hide under Bluey's bed. Cut a view of the space under the bed. Bandit enters the room and his feet walk into view.
Bandit: "Where are they?! I can't find them anywhere!"
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "Huh, maybe they went downstairs."
Bandit stomps his foot and leaves. Cut to the hallway, where Bluey and Bingo are tiptoeing past an open closet.
Bluey: (whispering) "I can't hear him. I think we should freeze him just in case."
Bingo nods.
Bluey: (whispering) "Give me the xylophone."
Bluey attempts to take the xylophone from Bingo. She yanks it back
Bingo: "No, I want to freeze him! You've had all the freezing turns!"
Bluey and Bingo start a tug-o-war with the xylophone.
Bluey: "Bingo! Let go!"
As they both scream and yell, the camera pans up, revealing that Bandit is hiding in the top of the linen closet. Seeing his chance, he jumps down to the kids.
Bandit: "Freedom!"
Bandit lands with a thud, causing the mallet and xylophone to fly high up and into Bandit's hands.
Bandit: "Got it! Mu-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! You ding-dongs were too busy squabbling! Freeze!"
Bandit dings the xylophone. Bluey freezes with both arms raised, and Bandit laughs evilly again. Bingo runs away, screaming.
Bandit: "Freeze! Freeze! Freeze!"
Bandit dings the xylophone repeatedly, but Bingo fails to freeze and runs off screen.
Bandit: "Mu-ha-ha! Never mind, she'll keep. Nowww... look at this lovely new garden gnome."
Bandit puts a gnome hat on Bluey and carries her out to the front, laughing evilly some more. He places her by the bird bath.
Bandit: "Ah, this is the perfect spot. Oh, wait a minute!"
Close up of Bluey's hand, which is covered in purple felt pen marks.
Bandit: "It's got a little bit of felt pen on the fingers. "
Bandit puts the xylophone down and pokes Bluey in the tummy.
Bandit: "Probably from some mischief! I'd better get the hose."
Bluey: (muffled noises of protest)
Bandit walks off, leaving the xylophone and mallet. Just after he does, Bingo comes out of the bush next to Bluey.
Bluey: "Nnn! Nnnnnnn!"
Bingo grabs the xylophone and mallet.
Bingo: (muffled) "Unfreeze me!"
Bingo: "Unfreeze!
Bingo dings the xylophone. Bluey unfreezes and takes off the hat.
Bluey: "Thanks, Bingo! Dad's gone to get the hose! Let's go and hi—"
As Bluey attempts to take the xylophone from Bingo again, Bingo dings the xylophone and freezes Bluey again.
Bingo: "Bluey, you always never take turns with me. You just take all of the turns! And it makes me feel sad. I will unfreeze you if you promise you will let me have turns, too. Blink two times if 'Yes'."
Pause. Cut to Bandit, carrying the running hose towards the front lawn.
Bandit: ♫ "Gonna hose my dirty garden gnome, gonna hose it good. Unh." ♫
Bingo is hiding behind the front steps. Cut to Bluey, in the same spot but now with one arm raised and the other behind her back. She glances towards Bandit.
Bandit: "Okay, time for a little bath, garden gnome!"
Bluey: "Nnn! Nnnn!"
Behind Bandit, Bingo kinks the hose to stop the water.
Bandit: "Ohhhhh, yeah!"
Bandit attempts to splash Bluey, but no water comes out the hose.
Bandit: "Huh?"
As Bandit looks directly into the hose, Bluey pulls out the mallet, revealing she was pretending to be frozen.
Bluey: "Freeze!"
Bluey dings the xylophone. Bandit freezes, holding the hose directly in front of his own face.
Bluey: "We tricked you! Bingo unfroze me. I was just pretending. Now, Bingo!"
Bingo unkinks the hose, causing Bandit to be sprayed in the face by water and making burbling noises. Bluey and Bingo laugh happily. A few birds watch the antics from a telephone wire as Bluey and Bingo sit on the front stairs, watching Bandit burbling as he gets sprayed. Bluey hands the xylophone and mallet over to Bingo.
Bluey: "Here, Bingo. You can unfreeze him."
Bingo: "Thanks, Bluey."
Bingo raisese the mallet, then pauses.
Bingo: "Not just yet. I like the Daddy water fountain."
Bluey puts an arm around Bingo's shoulder and the two silently giggle as Bandit continues to be sprayed.
The credits music is the Rondo Alla Turca with Bandit vocalizing over it. Bluey is dancing.
