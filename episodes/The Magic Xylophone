The episode opens with a view of the Heeler home. In the playroom, Bingo and Bandit are sitting on the kiwi rug, facing each other. Bluey lays across Bandit's lap.
Bandit: Ladies and gentlemen, I will now play for you: the Rondo Alla Turca.
Bandit cracks his knuckles and clears his throat as Bluey giggles. Then he starts 'playing' all over her, vocalizing the third movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11 as Bluey giggles and fidgets while she gets tickled. Bluey manages to flee, but Bandit tries to hold her down, getting dragged as she continues to crawl.
Bandit: Hey! Piano! Ladies and... gentlemen, I’m terribly sorry, I seem to be having a little bit of trouble with my piano!
Bandit finally gets Bluey back onto his lap, then proceeds to keep 'playing' all over her, repeating the same thing he did previously.
Bingo: Dad, I want to be the piano.
Bluey: No, it’s still my turn!
Bandit: Taking turns can be difficult.
Bingo: Dad, she’s had this many turns.
Bingo holds up five fingers and a foot.
Bandit: You can be the bum bongos!
Bandit proceeds to picks Bingo up and begins clapping her bottom, while vocalizing bongo sounds. 
Bandit: ♫ Bum bumba bum, bum bongos! ♫
Bluey starts to dance as Bingo giggles.
Bandit: ♫ Bum bumba bum, bum bongos! Bum bumba bum, bum bongos! Bum bumba bum, bum bongos! ♫
Chilli walks in.
Chilli: Ooh, island rhythms!
Chilli joins in dancing. Bandit continues to play the bum bongos as Bingo laughs and Chilli and Bluey dance.
TITLE CARD - the Magic Xylophone and the episode title
Bluey : This episode of Bluey is called: The Magic Xylophone!
Back in the playroom, Bandit is exercising his legs as Bluey holds onto them. Meanwhile, Bingo is looking in the bucket full of musical instruments.
Bingo: Where are the real bongos?
Bingo gasps at something and digs it out from the bucket.
Bingo: Bluey, look!
Bingo holds up a tiny xylophone for everyone in the room to see.
Bandit: Huh? Oh nooo...!
Bandit attempts to run, but Bluey manages to hold him down.
Bluey: Quick, Bingo! Get the dinger thing!
Bandit: Let me up! Let me out of here! Aaah!
Bingo manages to dig out the mallet.
Bingo: Got it!
Bluey: Do a ding!
Bingo: Freeze!
Bingo dings the xylophone with the mallet, making Bandit freeze.
Bluey and Bingo: (giggle) Yeah! The Magic Xylophone!
Giggling, Bluey and Bingo adjust Bandit's arms and mouth so that he's smiling with a thumbs up while picking his nose. Chilli walks in, packing a bag.
Bluey: Mum, come look at this!
Chilli: Oh look, it's just like when we first met...
Bluey picks up the Magic Xylophone and the mallet.
Bluey: Unfreeze!
Ding! Bandit unfreezes, Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: (grunts) What? How did I get fingers up my nose? Ah, the Magic Xylophone. Gimme that xylophone!
Bandit attempts to chase Bluey.
Bluey: Freeze!
Bandit: Gimme that x—!
Ding! Bandit freezes again. Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bluey: Bingo! Let's get the pens!
Bluey and Bingo drag chairs from the dining room, both giggling. Back in the playroom, Bluey draws on Bandit's face with pens.
Bluey : Oh, what a splendid moustache you have!
By now, Bandit has a deer antler hat, a sock on his tail, and Bingo is putting a fuzzy scarf on his neck.
Bingo : Ooh, lovely.
Bluey and Bingo walk to in front of Bandit.
Bingo: Is it my turn to unfreeze him?
Bingo lightly grabs the mallet, which Bluey ignores.
Bluey: Unfreeze!
Ding! Bandit stumbles.
Bandit: Ugh! Oh, what? Argh, you kids! Grr!
Bluey: Run!
Bandit chases the kids outside the house as they giggle.
Bandit: Give me that magic xylophone!
Bandit catches up and grabs Bluey.
Bandit: Gotcha!
Bluey screams as she's caught, then dings the Xylophone. Bandit freezes.
Bandit: D'ah...
Bluey: Ha-ha, too slow, Mr. Moustache!
Bingo: Bluey, you're taking all the turns freezing.
Bluey: C'mon, Bingo. Let's get the teddies!
Bingo : Ok...
Bluey and Bingo run off, leaving Bandit frozen in place. Chloe's Mum walks by with a stroller, slowing while passing by him, then hurrying away, very weirded out. Bluey and Bingo return, putting teddies in Bandit's arms while giggling. Chilli walks over with her bag.
Chilli: I'm off to work!
Bluey: Mum, Mum! Look at Dad now!
Chilli examines Bandit.
Chilli: This loose hair's been bugging me all morning.
Chilli pricks out one of Bandit's loose eyebrow hairs, making him flinch. She then kisses Bandit on the cheek, pats him, and leaves.
Bluey: Ok, I'll unfreeze him.
Bingo: I wanna do it. Mum, Bluey's not letting me have any turns.
Chilli: Bluey, if you don't take turns with people, people won't take turns with you.
Bluey: But Bingo is too slow. Dad will catch her.
Bingo: No, I'm not!
Chilli: You can either take turns, or I'll bring the xylophone to work with me. (aside) I'll freeze my boss.
Bluey and Bingo: No!
Bandit: (muffled noises of protest)
Chilli: Well, you know what to do, then. I'll see you later, just make sure you unfreeze him for toilet breaks, ok?
Bluey and Bingo: Ok!
Chilli drives off, giving the kids a horn honk. Bluey gives Bingo the Xylophone and guides her to stand a few metres behind Bandit.
Bluey: Here, Bingo. But stand right back here. That way you can get a head start. He runs really fast when he's mad.
Bingo: Ok. Unfreeze!
Ding! Bandit throws the teddies up into the air, confused, before spotting Bingo and Bluey giggling behind him.
Bandit: (splutters, gasps) THERE YOU ARE! GRRRHH!
Bluey: Run, Bingo! Back inside!
Bandit chases Bluey and Bingo into the kids' bedroom.
Bandit : Bingo! Bluey! Come back here!
Bingo and Bluey crawl under Bluey's bed, just before Bandit enters the room
Bandit: "Where are they? I can't find them anywhere!
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "Huh, maybe they went downstairs."
Bandit stomps his foot and leaves. Cut to the hallway, where Bluey and Bingo are tiptoeing past a closet.
Bluey : I can't hear him. I think we should freeze him just in case."
Bingo nods.
Bluey : Give me the Xylophone.
Bluey attempts to take the Xylophone from Bingo.
Bingo: No, I want to freeze him! You've had all the freezing turns!
Bluey and Bingo tug-o-war, trying to get the Xylophone.
Bluey: Bingo! Let go!
As they both scream and grunt, it is revealed Bandit is hiding in the top of the closet. Seeing his chance, he jumps down to the kids.
Bandit: FREEDOM!
Bandit lands, causing the mallet and Xylophone to fly high up and into Bandit's hands. He laughs a villainous laugh.
Bandit: You ding-dongs were too busy squabbling! FREEZE!
Ding! Bluey freezes, and Bandit villainously laughs again. Bingo runs away, screaming.
Bandit: FREEZE! FREEZE! FREEZE! (laughs again) Never mind, she'll keep. Nowww... look at this lovely new garden gnome!
Bandit puts a gnome hat on Bluey and carries her out to the front, laughing more.
Bandit: Ah, this is the perfect spot. Oh, wait a minute... it's got a little bit of felt pen on the fingers. Probably from some mischief!
He pokes Bluey
Bandit: I'd better get the hose.
Bluey: (muffled noises of protest)
Bandit walks off, leaving the Xylophone and mallet. Just after he does, Bingo comes out of the bush Bluey is next to.
Bluey: (muffled speech)
Bingo grabs the Xylophone and mallet.
Bingo : Unfreeze!
Ding! Bluey unfreezes and takes off the hat.
Bluey: Thanks, Bingo! Dad's going to get the hose! Let's go and hi-
As Bluey attempts to take the Xylophone from Bingo again, Bingo dings the Xylophone and freezes Bluey again.
Bingo: Bluey, you always never take turns with me. You just take all of the turns! And it makes me feel sad. I will unfreeze you if you promise you will let me have turns too. Blink two times if yes.
Pause. Cut to Bandit, carrying the running hose towards the front lawn.
Bandit : Gonna hose my dirty garden gnome, gonna hose it good.
Bingo is hiding in the background. Cut to Bluey, in the same spot but a different frozen pose.
Bandit: Ok, time for a little bath, garden gnome!
Bluey: Ngh! Ngghh!
Behind Bandit, Bingo kinks the hose to stop the water
Bandit: Ooo, ya! (realises the hose has stopped) Huh?
As Bandit looks into the hose, Bluey pulls out the mallet, revealing she was pretending to be frozen.
Bluey: FREEZE!
Ding! Bandit freezes.
Bluey: We tricked you! Bingo unfroze me. I was just pretending! NOW, BINGO!
Bingo unkinks the hose, causing Bandit to be sprayed in the face by water. Bluey and Bingo laugh happily. A few birds watch the antics from a telephone wire as Bluey and Bingo sit on the front stairs, watching Bandit burbling as he gets sprayed. Bluey hands the Xylophone and mallet over to Bingo.
Bluey: Here, Bingo. You can unfreeze him.
Bingo: Thanks, Bluey.
Bingo goes to unfreeze Bandit but stops herself.
Bingo: Not just yet. I like the daddy water fountain.
Bluey puts an arm around Bingo's shoulder and the two silently giggle as Bandit continues to be sprayed.
The credits music is the Rondo Alla Turca with Bandit vocalizing over it. Bluey is dancing.
