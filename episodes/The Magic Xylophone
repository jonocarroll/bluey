The episode opens with a distant view of the Heeler Home, playing an unknown piano tune, then it cuts to the playroom. Bingo is watching her dad as he has Bluey on his lap, acting as his piano.
Bandit: "Ladies and gentleman, I may now play for you, the "Rondo Alla Turca"."
Bandit does some minor preparations as Bluey giggles at this sight. Then he starts 'playing' all over her, vocalizing as the latter giggles and fidgets as she is being tickled. Then she manages to flee, but Bandit tries to hold her down, dragged as she continues to crawl.
Bandit: "Hey, piano! Ladies and... gentlemen, I’m terribly sorry, I seem to be having a little bit of trouble with my- piano!"
Bandit finally gets Bluey back onto his lap, then proceeding to keep 'playing' all over her, having repeated the same thing above the last time he did it.
Bingo: "Dad, I want to be a piano."
Bluey: "No, it’s still my turn!"
Bandit: "Taking turns can be difficult."
Bingo: "Dad! She’s had this many turns." Bingo tries to extend all her limbs while also holding up all of her fingers
Bandit: "You can be the bun bongos!" 
Bandit proceeds to picks Bingo up and begins clapping her bottom, while vocalizing bongo sounds. Just as that, Bluey dances as Bingo giggles, that's when Chilli walks in.
Chilli: "Ooh, island rhythms!"
Chilli joins in dancing before it cuts to the title card
TITLE CARD: The Magic Xylophone
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called The Magic Xylophone!"
The title card ends before it cuts to the playroom again, with Bandit exercising his legs as Bluey holds them down. Meanwhile, Bingo can be seen finding something in the bucket full of musical instruments.
Bingo: "Where are the real bongos?" Bingo gasps at something and digs it out from the bucket. "Bluey, look!"
Bingo holds up a tiny xylophone which she shows for everyone in the room to see.
Bandit: "Huh? Oh nooo...!" Bandit attempts to run, but Bluey manages to hold him down.
Bluey: "Quick, Bingo! Get the dinger thing!"
Bandit: He is currently struggling, attempting to run. "Let me up! Let me out of here!" His leg is pulled by Bluey, bringing pain. "Aaah!"
Bingo manages to dig out the mallet
Bingo: "Got it!"
Bluey: "Do a ding!"
Bingo: "Freeze!" She dings the xylophone with the mallet
As Bingo dings one of the xylophone's note, Bandit stops struggling and stops moving
Bluey and Bingo, at the same time: "Yeah!! The Magic Xylophone!"
The scene cuts to Bandit's face, with the audio starting to play playing the previously mentioned Rondo Alla Turca for the remainder of most likely the episode.
As Bluey and Bingo giggle, the adjust Bandit right hand to a pointing gesture, then up his right nostril. Bingo adjusts Bandit's left hand to a thumbs up gesture, then Bluey makes him smile by pressing the edge of his mouth to form a smile. Both Bluey and BIngo laugh after this procedure. Chilli then proceeds to walk in. What looks like she is packing something.
Bluey: "Mum, come look at this!"
Chilli: "Oh look, it's just like when we first met.."
Bluey runs to the xylophone and the dinger, grabbing both of them.
Bluey: "Unfreeze!"
Bandit unfreezes, he is confused on why he has a finger up his nose.
Bandit: "What?! How do I get fingers up my nose?"
Bluey and Bingo both laugh
Bandit: "Aww... The magic xylophone. Give me that xylophone!"
Bandit then chases Bluey, which Bluey evades by running past his right, Bandit then turns around to chase them.
Bluey: "Freeze!"
Bandit: Give me that x--!
Bluey dings the xylophone, which causes Bandit to freeze in place. Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bluey: "Bingo! Let's get the pens!"
It then cuts to what looks like the kitchen, with Bluey and Bingo dragging chairs, both giggling, it then cuts back to Bandit's face, with Bluey designing him with pens.
Bluey, in a fancy voice: "Oh what a splendid mustache you have!"
It zooms out, in a cutting motion, Bandit has a deer antler hat, with Bingo putting on a fuzzy scarf.
Bingo: "Ooh, Lovely."
It cuts then away from Bandit, with Bluey and Bingo coming from opposite sides in the playroom.
Bingo: "It's my turn to unfreeze him." She grabs the mallet lightly.
Bluey however holds up the mallet.
Bluey: "Unfreeze!" Bluey dings the xylophone with the mallet.
Bandit: He stumbles a little. "Ugh! What? Arrggh! You kids!"
Bluey: Run!
It cuts to the Heeler's home outside with Bandit chasing the kids as they giggled.
Bandit: "Give me that magic xylophone!" Bandit catches up and grabs Bluey. "Gotcha!"
Bluey screams as being caught, then she dings the xylophone.
Bandit: "Daagh!" He freezes in place.
Bluey: "Gah hah! Too slow Mr. Mustache!"
Bingo: "Bluey, you're taking all of the turns freezing."
Bluey ignores anyways.
Bluey: "C'mon Bingo, Let's get the teddies!" Bluey runs to the house.
Bingo, in an annoyed tone: "Ok.."
It cuts to the front of the Heeler home with Bandit frozen in place. Chloe’s Mum walks by with a stroller weirded out as looking at Bandit, slowing once passing by him, then walking away from the scene fast, while having the stroller. The scene cuts then to the side of Bandit, with Bluey and Bingo putting teddies on him giggling. Chilli then walks in the scene.
Chilli: "I'm off to work."
Bluey: "Mum, Mum! Look at dad now!"
Chilli: "This loose hair has been bugging me all morning!" While Chilli saying that, she pricks out one of Bandit's loose eyebrow hair, making him flinch. After that, she smooches Bandit on the cheek, pats him, and leaves.
It then cuts to Bluey and Bingo.
Bluey: "Ok, I'll unfreeze him."
Bingo: "I wanna do it." She then turns to Chilli. "Mum, Bluey's not letting me have any turns."
Chilli: She turns to Bluey, standing next to the car. "Bluey if you don't take turns with people, people won't take turns with you."
Bluey: "But Bingo is too slow, Dad will catch her."
Bingo: "No I'm not!"
It then cuts to Chilli, near the car.
Chilli: "You can either take turns or I'll bring the xylophone to work with me." She looks to the other side. "I'll freeze my boss."
It cuts to Bluey and Bingo, and then Bandit.
Bluey and Bingo: "No!
Bandit: "Nngh! Nnngh!" 
Chilli: "Well, you know what to do then. I'll see you later, just make sure you unfreeze him for toilet breaks, ok?" Chilli starts the car and revs back out of the driveway.
Bluey and Bingo: "Ok!" They both wave to Chilli as she drives off to work, with a distant honk.
Bluey: "Here Bingo. But stand right back here. That way you can get a head start. He runs really fast when he's mad." Bluey gives the xylophone to Bingo as saying that, and brings Bingo behind a few meters of Bandit, still frozen in place.
Bingo: "Ok. UNFREEZE!"
Bandit throws the teddies up into the air, confused, he turns around before spotting Bingo and Bluey laughing
Bandit: "THERE YOU ARE! RRRGGHH!"
Bluey: "Run Bingo! Back inside!"
Bandit chases them and Bluey and Bingo run back inside. Which cuts then to their bedroom.
Bandit, offscreen: "Bingo! Bluey! Come back here!"
Bingo and Bluey duck and crawls under to Bluey's bed.
Bandit, walking near Bluey's bed: "Where are they? I can't find them anywhere!"
Bingo, then Bluey laughs, then back to Bingo as Bandit is saying something.
Bandit: "Huh, maybe they went downstairs." He stomps his foot, and leaves.
The scene then cuts to a hallway, and a closet in front of the scene, Bluey is seen tip toeing, with Bingo following her.
Bluey, whispering: "I can't hear him, I think we should freeze him just in case." 
Bingo nods her head.
Bluey, still whispering: "Give me the xylophone." She grabs the xylophone from Bingo, trying to get it.
Bingo: "No, I want to freeze him! You had all the freezing turns!"
It turns into a tug-o-war between Bluey and Bingo, trying to get the xylophone.
Bluey: "Bingo! Let go!"
As both of them scream, the camera moves into the top, with Bandit hiding on top of the closet, he pops out.
Bandit: "FREEDOM!" Bandit lands, making Bingo throw the mallet and the xylophone high up, which then he catches, proceeding to do an evil villain laugh. "You ding dongs are too busy squabbling! FREEZE!" Bandit freezes Bluey with the xylophone with the mallet, doing an evil villain laugh again. He tries to freeze Bingo, who starts running away squealing. "FREEZE, FREEZE, FREEZE!"
As Bandit rings the magic xylophone higher, Bingo still manages to get away.
Bandit: Evil laughing again. "Never mind, she'll keep. Nowww..." He grabs a garden gnome hat and places it on Bluey. "Look at this lovely new garden gnome."
It then cuts to the outside, with Bandit carrying Bluey.
Bandit: Still having to evil laugh, he places Bluey down in the fountain. "Ah, this is the perfect spot. Oh, wait a minute.."
The scene cuts to Bluey's hand, with felt marker on her.
Bandit: "It's got a little bit of felt pen on the fingers."
The scene cuts back to the outside.
Bandit: He puts down the xylophone and mallet "Probably from some mischief!" He pokes Bluey's belly at the last word. "I better get the hose." He walks away.
Bluey, frozen: "Ngh! Ngghh!"
Bush rustling, Bingo comes out of the bush, and goes to Bluey.
Bluey, in a muffled, frozen tone: "Unfreeze me!"
Bingo grabs the xylophone and mallet, and dings the xylophone.
Bingo, whispering: "Unfreeze!"
Bluey: "Thanks Bingo!" She takes off the garden gnome hat. "Dad is going to get the hose! Let's go and hi-"
Bingo interrupts Bluey as she tries to get the xylophone, she dings the xylophone and freezes Bluey again.
Bingo: "Bluey, you always never take turns with me. You just take all of the turns! And it makes me feel sad. I will unfreeze you if you promise you will let me have turns too. Blink two times if yes." 
The scene cuts to Bandit with the hose, walking to the "frozen" Bluey, with the camera following Bandit.
Bandit, singing: "Gonna hose my dirty garden gnome! Gonna hose it, good!"
Bingo can be seen hiding in the background.
It then cuts to the fountain, with Bluey in a different pose.
Bandit: "Ok, time for a little bath garden gnome!"
Bluey, "frozen": "Ngh! Ngghh!"
It then zooms out by cutting, which Bingo then can be seen squeezing the hose to stop the water.
Bandit: "Ooo ya!" He thrusts the hose to Bluey, only to be empty of water. "Huh?" He looks in the hose.
Bluey then pulls out the mallet
Bluey: "FREEZE!" She dings the xylophone, freezing Bandit. "We tricked you! Bingo unfroze me. I was just pretending. NOW BINGO!"
Bingo unkinks the hose, causing Bandit to be sprayed by water. Both Bingo and Bluey giggle.
The scene cuts to a few birds watching the commotion from a telephone wire, before cutting to Bluey and Bingo watching Bandit being sprayed.
Bluey hands over the xylophone to Bingo.
Bluey: "Here Bingo, you can unfreeze him."
Bingo: "Thanks Bluey."
They still keep watching.
Bingo is about to ding one of the xylophone notes with the mallet, but she stops herself.
Bingo: "Not just yet. I like the daddy water fountain."
Bluey goes to Bingo and puts her arm around her shoulder.
The scene pans out as Bandit is being sprayed by the hose as Bluey and Bingo watch.
The episode ends, leading to the credits, with the previously mentioned Rondo Alla Turca with Bandit vocalizing over it. Bluey is seen dancing as the credits roll.
