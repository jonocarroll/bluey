Script
It starts with Bluey and Bingo in a hallway, sitting on 2 plastic green chairs. Bluey gets up and knocks on the door next to the chairs as she rushes back and sits down once again. Bandit opens the door.
Bandit: Oh. Hey, what's up? 
Bluey: We're here for the job interview. 
Bandit: Job interview? 
Bluey: We're playing Work. 
Bandit: Oh, Work.
Bandit realizes what she's talking about.
Bandit: Oh, Work.
The two giggle.
Title Card - Work
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called 'Work'. 
It cuts, Bandit is now wearing a tie whilst leading the girls into the room.
Bandit: So, this is a dancing work. Where we do lots of dancing! 
Bluey: No, you make drainpipes. 
Bandit: Oh, okay. Can it please be a dancing work? 
Bluey: No dancing.
Bandit: Yes boss.
Bluey: No, you're the boss. 
Bluey giggles as she walks away, Bandit stares at the camera in confusion. It cuts, Bandit sits down in a chair, giving the girls an interview.
Bandit: Okay, so we make drainpipes. And we're very busy. Are you a hard worker? 
Bluey leans back in the same plastic chair.
Bluey: Oh, definitely not. 
Bandit: Oh. Okay, and what about you?
Bingo: Ribbit! 
Bandit: Excuse me? 
Bingo: Ribbit. 
Bluey: Oh, she's a frog. 
Bandit: Oh. We've never hired a frog before. But I've got a good feeling about you. You're both hired! 
Bingo: Ribbit! 
Bingo does a dance, moving both her arms. Bluey quickly stops her.
Bluey: I said no dancing. 
Bingo: Ribbit. 
Bandit: Ah, I dreamt of running a dancing work once.
Bandit starts staring off into the distance, Bluey gets impatient, so to get his attention back, she clears her throat.
Bandit: Huh? Oh, you can start right away. 
Bingo: Ribbit! 
Bandit shakes hands with Bluey as Bingo jumps in the air.
Bluey: Why, thank you. 
Bandit: I'm sure I won't regret this. 
A wall clock is seen, as it ticks. Bingo is licking a 'drain pipe', which is a toilet paper roll. Bluey hammers it with a toy hammer.
Bandit: How're we going? 
Bluey: I've finished four works already! 
Bandit: Excellent. Here's some dollarbucks. 
Bandit hands Bluey a 'dollarbuck', he checks how Bingo's work is going.
Bandit: And what about you?
Bingo: Ribbit.
Bandit spots the roll covered in slobber and is disgusted.
Bandit: Ugh! You have one, too. 
Bandit hands her one also, as she's amazed by it.
Bluey: Ring, ring, ring! 
Bandit: Now, keep going while I take this phone call. 
Bandit imitates answering the phone.
Bandit: Boop! Hello? Yes, we do make drainpipes. 
Bandit opens the door, still talking into the 'phone'. He walks out the room.
Bandit: Uh, traditionally, they're round. 
He shuts the door, Bluey throws herself onto the couch.
Bluey: Ah, so relaxing. 
Bingo: Ribbit? 
Bluey: Oh, this is the life. 
The door opens, Bandit walks back in. He imitates ending the call.
Bandit: Boop! I'm back.
He spots Bluey slacking.
Bandit: Hey! 
Bluey screams and jumps off the couch. She runs back to her seat, giggling.
Bandit: You were slacking off at work! I should f- 
Bluey: Ring, ring, ring! 
Bandit: Agh, this phone! 
He imitates answering it once again.
Bandit: Boop! Hello? You did what?!
