The episode opens with Bluey and Bingo in the hallway, sitting on two plastic green chairs. Bluey gets up and knocks on the door next to the chairs as she rushes back and sits down once again. Bandit opens the door.
Bandit: "Oh. Hey, what's up?" 
Bluey: "We're here for the job interview." 
Bandit: "Job interview?" 
Bluey: "We're playing Work." 
Bandit: "Oh, Work."
Bandit realizes what she's talking about.
Bandit: "Oh, Work..."
The two giggle.
Title Card - Work
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Work." 
It cuts, Bandit is now wearing a tie whilst leading the girls into the room.
Bandit: "So, this is a dancing work where we do lots of dancing!" 
Bluey: "No, you make drainpipes." 
Bandit: "Oh, okay. Can it please be a dancing work?" 
Bluey: "No dancing."
Bandit: "Yes boss."
Bluey: No, you're the boss. 
Bluey giggles as she walks away, Bandit stares at the camera in confusion. It cuts, Bandit sits down in a chair, giving the girls an interview.
Bandit: Okay, so we make drainpipes. And we're very busy. Are you a hard worker? 
Bluey leans back in the same plastic chair.
Bluey: Oh, definitely not. 
Bandit: Oh. Okay, and what about you?
Bingo: Ribbit! 
Bandit: Excuse me? 
Bingo: Ribbit. 
Bluey: Oh, she's a frog. 
Bandit: Oh. We've never hired a frog before. But I've got a good feeling about you. You're both hired! 
Bingo: Ribbit! 
Bingo does a dance, moving both her arms. Bluey quickly stops her.
Bluey: I said no dancing! 
Bingo: Ribbit. 
Bandit: Ah, I dreamt of running a dancing work once.
Bandit starts staring off into the distance, Bluey gets impatient, so to get his attention back, she clears her throat.
Bandit: Huh? Oh, you can start right away. 
Bingo: Ribbit! 
Bandit shakes hands with Bluey as Bingo jumps in the air.
Bluey: Why, thank you. 
Bandit: I'm sure I won't regret this. 
A wall clock is seen, as it ticks. Bingo is licking a 'drain pipe', which is a toilet paper roll. Bluey hammers it with a toy hammer.
Bandit: How're we going? 
Bluey: I've finished four works already! 
Bandit: Excellent. Here's some dollarbucks. 
Bandit hands Bluey a 'dollarbuck', and he checks how Bingo's work is going.
Bandit: And what about you?
Bingo: Ribbit.
Bandit spots the roll covered in slobber and is disgusted.
Bandit: Ugh! You have one, too. 
Bandit hands her one also, as she's amazed by it.
Bluey: Ring, ring, ring! 
Bandit: Now, keep going while I take this phone call. 
Bandit imitates answering the phone.
Bandit: Boop! Hello? Yes, we do make drainpipes. 
Bandit opens the door, still talking into the 'phone'. He walks out the room.
Bandit: Uh, traditionally, they're round. 
He shuts the door, Bluey throws herself onto the couch.
Bluey: Ah, so relaxing. 
Bingo: Ribbit? 
Bluey: Oh, this is the life. 
The door opens, Bandit walks back in. He imitates ending the call.
Bandit: Boop! I'm back.
He spots Bluey slacking.
Bandit: Hey! 
Bluey screams and jumps off the couch. She runs back to her seat, giggling.
Bandit: You were slacking off at work! I should f- 
Bluey: Ring, ring, ring! 
Bandit: Agh, this phone! 
He imitates answering it once again.
Bandit: Boop! Hello? You did what?! I got to duck out again. Get back to work, and no slacking off! 
Bandit shuts the door. Bluey gets out of her seat.
Bluey: Right, I'm in charge.
Bluey runs over to the chair, and sits in it.
Bluey: Frog Bingo, I'm going to need you to throw all these papers on the floor, please. 
Bingo: Ribbit.
Bingo throws the paper into the air, the paper then floats down onto the floor.
Bluey: Excellent work. Now, jump on them, please. 
Bingo jumps on the pile of paper.
Bingo: Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit! 
Bluey: Oh, and play this. 
Bluey points to a paper towel roll. Bingo giggles and grabs it.
Bingo: Ribbit, ribbit. 
Bluey sighs, as Bingo continues.
Bandit: Okay, I'm back. Hey! What's going on? Why is that frog jumping on my work, and what are you doing in my chair? 
Bluey: I'm the boss now. 
Bandit: What? Says who? 
Bluey: Says this. 
Bluey scribbles on a piece of paper with a red marker, she hands him the paper.
Bandit: Well, this all looks in order then. 
Bluey: You have to do everything I say. 
Bandit: What? 
Bluey: Ugh, this chair is uncomfortable. Worker, be my chair! 
She points to Bandit.
Bandit: But, but- 
Bluey: No buts. 
Bluey claps twice.
Bandit: Ugh, yes boss. 
It cuts, we see Bandit acting as a chair while Bluey sits on his back. Bingo is drawing the situation.
Bandit: This is not how you treat employees. 
Bluey: Chairs can't talk. 
Bandit: Ugh.
Bluey giggles.
Bluey: Now clean those windows!
It cuts, we see Bandit crawl to the window while Bluey giggles. Bandit wipes the window with his hand.
Bluey: Uh-uh-uh! clean them with your bottom!
Bluey giggles.
Bandit: My bottom?
Bluey: Do it!
It cuts, we see Wendy spraying water on flowers, and Bandit wipes his bottom on the window while Bluey is looking at papers.
Wendy: (Disgust noise)
Bluey: Once you're finished this one. You can mop the floor with your tongue.
Bluey giggles.
Bandit: Ohh.
Bandit: Ugh, I hope that's gravy.
Bandit: Ughh!
Bingo: Ribbit, ribbit!
Bandit: What are you doing?
Bingo comes and start to dance and then Bandit accidentally joins Bingo's dancing before bluey returns
Bandit: Stop that dancing! You're gonna get us in trouble!
Bluey: What is the meaning of this?
Bandit: Um, I was just, um --
Bluey: You were dancing!
Bandit: Um, yes, it was me. I was dancing. She had nothing to do with it.
Bluey: I said no dancing. Get out, and don't come back.
Bandit: What? You mean you're firing me?
Bluey nods
Bandit: Please! This job is my whole life!
Bluey: Too bad! Rip! Out!
