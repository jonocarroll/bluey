Rad: (to Bingo) How are you doing, Bluey?

The rest of the family walk in. Bandit gives his brother a small wave.
Bingo: (points at her sister) Yeah, that's Bluey!
Rad: Oh yeah, cause he's blue!
Bluey: (to her uncle, furious) I'm a girl!
Rad: Oh, yeah. I knew that.
Bingo: Are you putting us to bed tonight, Uncle Rad?
Rad: You bet!
Bingo: Hurray!
"Bluey": (sad) Not hurray.
Chilli: Bluey isn't sure about babysitter putdowns, Uncle Rad.
Uncle Rad puts down Bingo to the floor.
Rad: Don't worry, Bluey! Who better to do a babysitter putdown than your Uncle Rad?
Just so, Frisky shows up on the front door.
Frisky: Hello!
Bluey and Bingo: Frisky!
Frisky: Hey, girls! Ooh!
Bingo: (turns around and points at Uncle Rad) This is Uncle Rad.

Rad: ...Hi.
Frisky: ...Hi.
Chilli: Frisky, have you met Bandit's brother, Radley, before?
Frisky: Um, yeah. Didn't you fall in the pool at the wedding?
Rad:" Probably.
Bingo: (to Uncle Rad) Frisky is Bluey's fairy godmother.
Chilli: Sorry, Frisky. Uncle Rad got in touch last minute and said he'd babysit. You mustn't have got my message. 
Frisky: Oh, (looks at her phone) no. I didn't get it. That's fine. um, I'll just go. (puts her phone back and prepares to leave)
Bluey and Bingo try to hold Frisky from leaving.

"Frisky:" Oh, why not?
"Bluey:" It was just too different.
"Rad:" Well, your fairy godmother and I will make this exactly the same as a Mum and Dad putdown!

"Rad:" Chickenwhat? 
"Bluey:" Come Here and Go Away! 
"Rad:" Come Here go and where?
"Frisky:" You don't need the same games, Bluey. You need Torchmouse!
"Bluey and Bingo:" Squeak. Squeak, squeak, squeak.
"Rad and Frisky:" Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
"Rad:"Meow?
"Frisky:" Arrgh!
"Bluey and Bingo:" Squeak, squeak, squeak.

 "Bluey:" Squeak! 
 "Rad:" Rowrr! Rowrr!
Frisky is brushing Bingo's hair while brushing her teeth
"Bluey:" Torchmouse was fun, but i don't want to do anything else that's different, please.
"Rad:" What about this?
"Bluey:" Whee. This is weird.
"Rad:" Yeah. But before you know it, you get used to it. 
Bluey drops his toothbrush while on the top of the ceiling and giggles
"Bingo:" Do me!
"Frisky:" Oh, boy. I'll give it a crack!
"Bluey:" Hello upside down Bingo!
"Bingo:" Hi.
"Frisky:" Bingo. You've gotten... Heavy!
"Bluey:" Come and sit by the campfire.
"Bingo:" I'm trying!
Bingo falls down while Frisky was holding her and gotten heavy
"Frisky:" How about a story?
"Rad:" And then the prince knocked the dragon with a big prince punch.
"Rad:" BOOM!
"Bluey and Bingo:" Hooray!
"Rad:" Princess. i have rescued you. Now we shall marry.
"Frisky:" And the Princess replied, No thanks!
"Rad:" What?
Bingo giggles and Bluey starts to laugh.
"Frisky:" She didn't like the look of him.
"Rad:" Why not?
"Frisky:" Well, his hair was a bit messy, and he was a bit too muscly,
you know what i mean, kids?
Bluey and Bingo starts to giggle while in the part.
"Rad:" Hang on, I prince-punch the dragon, take you back to the castle and we get married. That's business.
"Frisky:" Hey, i didn't ask to be rescued.
"Rad:" You'd rather stay with the stinky dragon?
"Frisky:" I'm getting used to him.
Bluey and Bingo are still giggling after the part.
"Rad:" Ok, i will wake him up.
"Frisky:" Wait. No!
"Rad:" Yeah. Didn't think so.
Bluey and Bingo started laughing at the part when he was gonna wake the dragon up.
"Frisky:" Ugh, Princes are all the same, she thought.
"Rad:" No we're not. There's good princes and bad princes, m'lady.
Everyone knows that.
"Bluey:" Which one was the prince?
"Rad": He's good. He rescued the princess.
"Frisky:" Only because he like prince-punching dragons.
Tomorrow he'll be off in search of another princess.
"Rad:" Man, this princess is hard to rescue.
Both giggled and laughed in the story
"Frisky:" Well, while the prince figures it all out, she grabs a nice book and lives happily ever after. The end.
"Bluey:" What?!
"Bingo:" That is not the end.
"Bluey:" In Mum and Dad Stories they get married in the end!
"Rad:" Er, princess?
"Frisky:" Ok, fine. For the sake of children they get married. The end.
"Both:" Hooray!
"Rad:" I'll take it. Night-night, Bingo. did you have a good...
Bingo snores while sleeping
"Bluey:" Frisky, you won't watch TV after i fall asleep, will you?
"Frisky:" Oh, ah, no, we don't have to.
"Bluey:" You promise?
"Rad:" Oh, hang on. Was your last babysitter putdown with Nana?
"Bluey:" Yes.
"Rad:" And let me guess, you woke up, and the TV was too loud.
"Bluey:" Yes.
"Rad:" Mum can't hear very well so she turns it up loud.
"Bluey:" She was watching something scary.
"Frisky:" That's why you don't like babysitter putdowns, isn't it?
"Bluey:" Yes.
"Rad:" Look, you had a bad one, kid. This one will be different.
"Frisky:" We promise.
"Bluey:" But how can I know for sure it won't happen again?
"Frisky:" You can't. But you have to give it a go anyway, or you'll be stuck in the tower with a stinky dragon forever.
"Bluey:" Ok. I'll give it a go.
"Frisky:" That's my girl.
Bluey is sleeping while with Frisky and Rad 
"Frisky:" Absolutely.
"Rad:" Yeah, that's right.
"Frisky:" No, i never thought of it the way.
"Rad:" It's the only shampoo i like.
"Frisky:" The shampoo is great, but the conditioner, i didn't rate the conditioner.
"Rad:" Nah, me either. But you know, you can't get around with open follicles.
