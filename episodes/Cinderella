The short opens with an establishing shot of the Heeler house in the night-time. In the kids' bedroom, Bandit lies down on Bluey's bed with Bluey and Bingo. He holds a fairytale book with the front cover art resembling Jack and the Beanstalk.
Bandit: Okay, "Cinderella". Good choice.
Bingo: Can you make it funny?
Bandit: Yeah, okay. You help me.
Bandit opens the book and reads the page.
Bandit: "Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Cinderella."
Bluey: No, no, her name is Cheryl.
Bingo: Yeah, Cheryl! (giggles)
Bandit: (continues reading) "And Cheryl lived with her stepsisters, who made her do all the washing and ironing and cleaning up, and they never lifted a finger to help." Oh well, that's sound familiar. 
Bandit playfully nudges Bluey. Both girls giggle quietly.
Bandit: "One day the king announced a royal ball, where his son, the prince--"
Bluey: Call him Leroy!
Bandit: "Where his son, Leroy, would find a wife. (in a high-pitched accent) 'Oh, I would so like to go to that ball!'"
Bluey: No, no, do your funny voice.
Bandit: (in a Cockney accent) "Oh, I would so like to go to that ball!" That's terrible.
Bluey and Bingo giggle again as Bandit turns the next page.
Bandit: "Suddenly, the fairy godmother appeared. POOF!"
Bingo: Her name is Madge.
Bandit: "Madge appeared and said: (in a gruff hardboiled accent) 'G'day, Darlin'. Let's get you ready for the big dance.'"
Bluey and Bingo giggle again. Bandit skims through the story.
Bandit: "So she--" Uh, look, I'll skip all this stuff, it's getting late. "She did a bunch of magic stuff, and soon enough, Cinderella was--"
Bluey & Bingo: Cheryl!
Bandit: "Cheryl was at the ball, when suddenly she saw Leroy, cutting it up on the dance floor." (starts scatting and moving his arms) Oh yeah, oh yeah! "So Cheryl busts a few moves of her own--" (humming) "--and Leroy goes, 'What's cookin', good lookin'?', and Cinderella's all like--"
Bluey & Bingo: Cheryl!
Bandit: I mean, Cheryl! "Cheryl's all like, 'Not much, dude. How good's this music?'"
Bluey and Bingo giggle again. Bandit turns back a few pages.
Bandit: Ah, hang on. I missed a bit where Madge said something about midnight.
Bandit then closes the book and puts it under Bluey's pillow.
Bandit: Ah, I'll just wing it from here. "Anyway, they had a great time, Leroy did his moonwalk and Cheryl did a few party tricks 'cause she could pop a shoulder out of its socket, and it was all going well. But it was getting late, so Leroy said to Cheryl, 'Thanks, Cheryl! I've had a great time.' And Cheryl's all like, 'Yeah, you got alright.' So then Leroy asked Cheryl if she wants to do some circle work in his new ute, but Cheryl remembers something about a pumpkin, so she legs it out of there. 'Oi!' says Leroy, 'where you goin'?!' But she was off into the night on a dirt bike!"
Bluey and Bingo squeal gleefully as Bandit imitates a dirt bike's engine. Chilli walks by the bedroom door.
Chilli: Calm. Bedtime, remember.
Chilli walks away as Bandit continues making up the story.
Bandit: "But she left behind a glass slipper."
Bingo: No, make it something funny.
Bandit: Uhh, any ideas?
Bluey: Roller skate!
Bandit: Okay. "So she left behind her roller skate! So the prince--"
Bluey & Bingo: Leroy!
Bandit: "So Leroy went from house to house trying the roller skate on all the ladies, until he found Cheryl. And she put 'em on and they fit and he was like, 'Yeah!' And she was like, 'Choice!' And then they had a big wedding in Bali and the stepsisters accidentally wore the same dress and Leroy's dad fell in the pool. The end."
Bluey & Bingo: Again!
Bandit: No!
