This episode opens on the remains of a meal - a single crinkle-cut chip on a plate, surrounded by ketchup. The shot pulls back to show the whole table: the Heelers have just finished a meal. Bluey and Bingo are coloring with crayons. Bandit is sitting quietly; Chilli raises a hand to get a server's attention.
Chilli: Excuse me? Yes, over here.
Bingo: Ooh, I need brown.
Bingo reaches for her crayons, and knocks the box off the table.
Bingo: Oops.
Bingo ducks under the table. She bumps the table, knocking over the table number. Chilli picks it up and straightens the card.
Chilli: Oh, yes. Can we get the bill, please?
Bluey: (singing loudly and shrilly) OH, CAN WE GET THE BILL?!
Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.
Bluey: (singing quietly) Oh, can we get the bill?
Bandit: Is Bingo gonna eat that chip?
Chilli: Uh, no. I think she's finished.
Bandit: SCAB!
Bandit snatches the ship and eats it. Bingo climbs back into her seat and sets her crayon box on the table.
Bingo: There! Hey, where's my chip?
Bandit: Ee!
Bluey: Dad ate it.
Bandit swallows guiltily.
Bingo: (betrayed) What?!
The Heeler family is standing outside at a crosswalk. Bingo looks very upset.
Bingo: I was saving that chippy.
Bandit: I know. I said I was sorry, kid.
Chilli: It's my fault. I thought you'd finished.
Bingo: I was still very hungry.
Chilli: How can we make it up to you, Bingo?
Bandit: Yeah. Name your price.
Bluey: Ah! I know.
Bluey whispers something in Bingo's ear. She perks up, and both Bingo and Bluey start to wag their tails.
Bingo: Eee! Dance mode!
Bandit and Chilli: Aw, not dance mode. 
Bingo and Bluey giggle.
TITLE CARD - Dance Mode
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Dance Mode.
Chilli pushes the crossing button repeatedly.
Bluey: Eee, I'm so excited!
Bingo: Me too!
Bandit: Right. You get three dance modes, Bingo, and then that's it.
Bluey and Bingo: Okay.
The crossing signal changes from a red sitting dog to a green walking dog.
Chilli: Green dog. Come on.
The Heelers cross the street. One of the cars is playing loud music.
Bluey: (gasps) Bingo, music! Shall we put Mum in dance mode?
Bingo: Um, yes, okay.
Bluey: I'll do it.
Bluey flips Chilli's tail like a switch. Chilli immediately starts to dance as she continues through the crosswalk.
Bluey and Bingo: (laugh)
As Chilli continues to dance, drivers stare, laugh, and honk their horns.
Bandit: Quick, let's bail kids! She's not with us!
Chilli: Bandit!
Bandit hurries away, taking Bluey and Bingo with him. Chilli has one more car to cross in front of - and Wendy is driving it; Pat is in the car behind Wendy. Wendy doesn't notice Chilli - she's rummaging in the glove box, and then she recognizes Bandit and watches him leave the crosswalk. As Chilli shimmies in front of Wendy's car, Pat leans out the window.
Pat: Whoo! Shake it Chilli!
Wendy glares at Pat and shakes her head.
Chilli: (waves) Morning, Wendy!
Wendy finally notices Chilli, looking shocked. The shot cuts to the other side of the crosswalk. As Chilli exits the street, Bluey and Bingo giggle. Chilli leans on the crosswalk button and wipes sweat from her brow.
Chilli: Phew.
Bluey: That was so funny.
Chilli is sweating a lot.
Bandit: You still got it, babe.
Chilli: You'll get yours.
Bingo: Bluey, the next dance mode is going to be mine to choose when, okay? Not you.
Bluey: Okay.
A few dogs are standing around outside a post office. Inside, Bandit is second in line at the counter. Bluey is holding his hand, Bingo is reading a book, and Chilli is browsing a display of greeting cards.
Bluey: Are you gonna use your dance mode in here, Bingo?
Bingo: No. I wanna save it for somewhere special. Plus there's no music here.
Bluey: Oh, yeah.
Bandit: Aw, what a shame.
Postie: Next, please.
Bandit and Bluey walk up to the counter.
Postie: How can I help?
Bandit: I just need to change the address on this.
Bandit hands Postie his driver's license.
Postie: Okay. I'll need to see two forms of I.D., please.
Bandit: Two? Uh, hang on. Let me have a look.
Chilli opens up a card - it plays a chiptune version of Oh! Susannah.
Chilli: Ooh, music! Bingo, can I please use dance mode on your dad?
Bingo: Uh, well, it's just --
Chilli: Pretty please.
Chilli makes her Please Face.
Bingo: (hesistantly) Uh, okay, yes.
Chilli: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
The scene cuts back to Bandit, who is holding out another card for Postie to see.
Bandit: Well, I've got my gym card. It's sorta got my picture on it.
Postie: Uh, no. I can't use a gym card, mate.
Oh! Susannah begins to play from offscreen.
Bandit: Oh no!
Chilli flips Bandit's tail down, activating Dance Mode.
Chilli: Dance mode!
Bandit spins around, then starts shaking his bum. Chilli, Bingo and Bluey laugh. Bandit keeps holding up his gym card as he dances.
Postie: Uh, are you okay?
Bandit does some kicks.
Bandit: I'm fine. Just ignore this. 
Bandit does The Twist. He gets out his library card
Bandit: Now, um, what about my library card?
Postie: Uh, I'm sorry, we can only accept...
Bandit does The Running Man.
Postie: Look, if you could just stop dancing for a moment.
Bandit does a Cossack dance.
Bandit: I would if I could, mate.
Bandit starts doing a jig. Chilli, Bingo, and Bluey are laughing at him. The customer at the end of the line heckles him.
Customer: Hey, Twinkle-toes! Hurry up!
The scene cuts to the Heeler family walking down the sidewalk. Bingo and Bluey are still laughing.
Chilli: That was glorious.
Bandit: Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bluey: When are you gonna use your last dance mode, Bingo?
Bingo: Last one? But I haven't even used my first one yet.
Music starts to play.
Bluey: What's that noise?
Bandit starts to herd his family back the way they came.;;
Bandit: Uh, let's, um, go this way instead. Come on, come on, come on!
Bluey: Ooh, here. Hang on.
Bandit tries to block Bluey's view with his body.
Bandit: Nothing to see up there.
Bluey: Ooh, look!
Bingo points past Bandit. Cut to Busker, who is playing on a Thongophone - an instrument consisting of a tangle of PVC pipes, played by slapping the pipe openings with thongs. He is surrounded by a crowd of several dozen people, and has set out a hat to accept tips.
Busker: Whoo! Shake it! (howls)
The Heelers approach.
Busker: Shake your tails!
Bluey: He's playing music with thongs!
Bingo: Wow!
Bluey: Is this a good place for you dance mode?
Bingo: Ooh, yeah!
Bluey: Do it, Bingo.
Bingo: Dance mo--
Bingo tries to flip Bandit and Chilli's tails. They grab their tails and pull them out of the way before Bingo can reach them.
Bandit: Oh, hang on.
Chilli: Yeah, hang on.
Bingo: Hey.
Bandit: Look, uh, you seem like you're cheered up, Bingo. Maybe we can forget about that last dance mode.
Bingo: Aw, what?
Bluey: No fair!
Bandit pulls out his wallet and rummages for bills.
Bandit: Okay, look, I'm gonna buy your last dance mode off you for, uh, ten -- no, no, no, twenty bucks.
Chilli: Bandit, no!
Bluey: Whoa, twenty dollar bucks! You could buy a Yes/No button!
Bandit: Yeah, yeah. Yes/No button -- that thing sounds good.
Bluey makes her Please Face.
Bluey: Please, Bingo?
Bandit makes his Please Face, holding out a 20 dollar bill. Chilli glares at him and shakes her head.
Bandit: Pretty please?
Bingo: Uh. Okay.
Bingo takes the 20 dollar bill, but looks conflicted about it.
Bluey: Hooray! Let's go!
Bluey runs off happily. Bingo follows. Bandit pantomimes wiping his brow.
Bandit: Phew!
Chilli: This is not good parenting.
The scene cuts to a very small store that mainly sells backpacks - it also sells plushies, water bottles, keychains, and headphones. And, of course, Yes/No buttons - a yellow keychain with a green "Y" button and a red "N" button. Bandit and Chilli are standing at the register, looking bored. Bingo and Bluey are over by the Yes/No buttons.
Bluey: Oh, here it is. Look, Bingo. You push this.
Yes/No Button: YES
Bluey laughs. Bingo looks at her blankly.
Bluey: And if you push this one...
Yes/No Button: NO
Bluey laughs. 
Bluey: What do you think? Do you want it, yeah? Should we get it?
Bingo: Uh, okay.
Bluey: Hooray!
The scene cuts to a parking garage. The family is walking together; Bluey is playing with the Yes/No Button.
Yes/No Button: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
Bandit: Well that all worked out, didn't it, kids?
Yes/No Button: YES
Bluey giggles. Bingo looks sad.
The scene changes to the back seat of the Heeler's car. Bluey is still playing with the Yes/No Button, Bingo is still sad.
Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
Bandit: Aw, Bingo, what's up?
Chilli: You wanna tell us what's the matter, honey?
Bingo shakes her head.
Bluey: Do you not like your Yes/No Button?
Bingo takes the Yes/No Button and presses "N."
Yes/No Button: NO
Bluey: (yelling) BUT YOU SAID YOU WANTED IT!
Bandit: Bluey, inside voice.
Bluey: (stage-whispering) But she said she wanted it, so why is she upset?
Chilli: Is it because people keep taking things from you without asking?
Bingo presses "Y."
Yes/No Button: YES
Chilli: I thought so.
Bandit: Like when I took your last chip?
Bingo presses "Y."
Yes/No Button: YES
Chilli: And I took one of your dance modes.
Bingo presses "Y."
Yes/No Button: YES
Bluey: Well, I took one, too, but I asked. We all asked, and she said "yes." Didn't you Bingo?
Bingo hesitates, then presses "Y."
Yes/No Button: YES
Bluey: See? So what are we meant to do then?
Bandit: This is confusing.
Chilli: Bingo, sometimes does your outside voice say "yes" when your inside voice really means "no"?
Bluey: Oh, yeah, like this.
Bluey mashes the Yes and No button at the same time.
Yes/No Button: YES NO NO Y-NO YES
Bingo smiles. Bluey, Bingo, and Bandit laugh.
Bluey: I'm sorry Bingo.
Chilli: Me too.
Bandit: Yeah, me too.
Bandit rubs Bingo's head and she giggles.
Bluey: (leadingly) Can you think of a way that we can make it up to you?
Bandit and Chilli: Whoa, hang on.
Thongophone music begins to play, and Bingo smiles evilly. She presses the "Y" button.
Yes/No Button: YES
The scene cuts back to Busker playing the thongophone. Bluey's Tooth Fairy money is in his hat.
Busker: Hey! Hey, hey!
The Heelers are standing at the front of the crowd. Bingo's tail is wagging hard.
Bluey: This is gonna be fun!
Bandit: Oh, boy.
Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey all put their tails together.
Bluey: We're ready, Bingo!
Bingo squeals and moves into position.
Bandit: This seems to happen to us a lot.
Chilli: (laughing) Just dance like no one's watching.
Bingo stands behind them with her hand in the air.
Bingo: Ready?
Bandit closes his eyes in embarrassment and addresses the crowd.
Bandit: Ladies and gentlemen: I'm doing this for my kid!
Bingo slaps her hand down, flipping down all of their tails.
Bingo: Dance Moooode!
Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey leap into the open space in the center of the plaza, and start dancing like crazy.
Busker: Whoo! Yeah! Here we go!
As the Heelers dance, each of them gets a solo shot: Bluey is fist pumping and jumping around; Chilli is windmilling her arms; Bandit is doing the robot. Bingo is bouncing from side to side and hitting the "Y" button.
Yes/No Button: YES YES YES YES
Busker: Whoo! Yeah!
Bandit, Chilli, and Bluey are still dancing.
Bandit: Let's take this to the mat!
Bandit flops down on the ground and starts doing the Worm.
Busker: Who likes to daaaance?!
Bluey dances to the Busker's song, which continues through the end credits.
