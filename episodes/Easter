The episode starts at the Heeler household, in the late evening.
Bandit: "Big sleep tonight, kids! The Easter Bunny's coming!"
Chilli: "I wonder how many eggs he'll leave you in your Easter pouches!"
Bingo: "How do we know he won't forget us again?"
Bluey: "Yeah, like he did last year!"
Chilli: "Look, we've been through this. He didn't forget you! He was just late. He explained it all in his letter, remember?"
The shot moves to Bandit, who reads a note left on the wall from last Easter.
Bandit: "Dear Bluey and Bingo, so sorry I was late with your Easter eggs. I had some family stuff on. I won't go into it. Big love, Easter Bunny. See? He was just busy!"
The Pups: "Okay."
Chilli: "We promise he won't forget this time."
Bandit and Chilli exit. Before she does however, she knocks over a bottle of confetti.
Chilli: "Oh goodness!"
Bandit: "Eh, we'll clean it up in the morning."
Chilli: "Night kids!"
Chilli and Bandit leave.
Bingo: "Bluey!"
Bluey: "Yeah, Bingo?"
Bingo: "Why did the Easter Bunny only forget us?"
Bluey: "I don't know!"
Bingo: "Do you think he'll remember us this time?"
Bluey: "Yeah, I do! Night, Bingo."
Bluey goes to sleep and Bingo stares up at the ceiling.
EPISODE TITLE: Easter
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called Easter."
The shot cuts to Bluey waking up in the morning. She suddenly sits up.
Bluey: "It's Easter! Bingo, wake up!"
Bingo is startled and falls out of bed.
Bingo: "Did he come!?" 
Bluey checks her Easter pouch on her bed.
Bluey: "I'm not sure. I can't see any eggs!"
Bingo goes to check hers as well.
Bingo: "Mine's empty too! He forgot us again!"
Bluey: "Wait!"
Bingo: "What is it?"
Bingo runs over to Bluey, who pulls out a rainbow box out of her Easter pouch, the only item in there.
Bluey: "It's a box!"
Bingo: "Eeee, the egg must be inside!"
Bluey opens the box and turns it over, only to find it empty.
Bluey: "It's empty!"
Bingo: "Awwww...."
Bluey: "Let's check yours again!"
Bluey & Bingo run over to the latter's bed, as Bingo reaches into her Easter pouch and pulls out the letter B.
Bingo: "There is something! Oh, it's just a buh. He doesn't care about us!"
Discouraged, Bingo sits down with a saddened expression.
Bluey: "He does, Bingo! I think these are clues to where he's hidden our Easter eggs!"
Bluey examines the items and tries to think of what it could mean.
Bluey: "Ooh, I know! Letter, box!
The Pups: "Letterbox!"
The shot cuts to Bluey and Bingo, who are speeding down the hallways with the Easter pouches around their backs. They run down the stairs and outside to the letterbox.
Bingo: "Are the eggs in there?"
Bluey: "No, just a chatterbox."
Bingo: "Is it from the Easter Bunny!?"
Bluey: "It is! Look!"
Bingo squeals and Bluey tries solving it.
Bluey: "Ea-ster...egg! Hmmm...what's your favorite color?"
Bingo: "Blue, like you!"
Bluey lifts up the blue colored flap on the chatterbox, and shows a picture of the Easter egg and a chef hat.
Bluey: "It's a cook's hat, with an egg!"
Bingo: "What does it mean?"
Bluey: "Well, cooks work in the kitchen...maybe the Easter eggs are in the kitchen!"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
The two laugh and run back inside the house.
Bingo: "The Easter Bunny knows my favorite color!"
Bluey: "I told you he cares about you!"
The pups run into the kitchen, where Bandit and Chilli are.
Bandit: "Happy Easter-- hey!"
Chilli: "Hey!"
Bluey and Bingo scramble to find the easter eggs, pushing Bandit and Chilli out of the way.
Bluey: "Sorry mum, we're looking for the Easter eggs! They could be anywhere..."
Bingo: "Bluey look, it's an egg!"
Bingo points at the front of the refrigerator, where various fridge magnets and letters are shaped to form an easter egg.
The Pups: "Whoa..."
Bingo opens the fridge, and Bluey squeals excitedly, believing their hunt to be over. However, they find nothing.
Bluey: "Ah, they're not in here."
Bingo: "Awww..."
Bluey: "Wait, look at the normal eggs!"
Bingo: "Oh? The Easter Bunny doesn't bring normal eggs. He brings chocolate eggs!"
Bluey: "I know, but look at the end one!"
The camera zooms in on the "egg" that stands out from the rest, at the end of the carton.
Bingo: "Huh? One egg is a kiwi! Maybe there's chocolate inside!"
The shot cuts to Bandit, as Bluey and Bingo run to him.
Bluey: "Dad, is there chocolate in this?"
Bandit: "Let's see!"
Bluey gives Bandit the kiwi, who promptly cuts in half. However, its only a normal kiwi.
Bandit: "No, no chocolate."
Bingo: "Aww..."
Bluey thinks hard on what it could mean, being a potential clue for the Easter eggs' true location.
Bluey: "I think I know where the eggs are!"
The pups run to the living room, where the kiwi rug resides.
Bluey: "The kiwi rug!"
Bingo: "I'll look under it!"
Bluey: "Hmm...I can't see them."
Bingo: "Aww...Maybe the Easter Bunny just likes other children more than me."
Bluey: "No, Bingo, he likes you! It's just that..-"
Bingo: "Ah, look!"
Bingo points to the kiwi rug, where they spot an arrow.
Bluey: "It's an arrow!"
Bingo: "It's pointing to the backyard!"
Bluey: "Come on!"
The pups run outside into the backyard, where they split up to find it.
Bluey: "You look over there!"
Bingo checks the sand castle, and Bluey runs to examine another area.
Bingo: "I don't remember that sand castle."
Bluey: "Hey, Bingo. Are the poinsettia flowers normally in a straight line?
Bingo: "Hmm...Usually they're more higgledy-piggledy."
Bluey: "I think it's a picture."
Bingo: "A picture of what?"
Bluey: "I don't know! But I know how to find out, come on!"
The pups run up the stairs onto the top of the second floor deck. They go to check the poinsettia petals.
Bluey: "Wow." 
Bingo: "It's a castle! Our eggs must be in the castle!"
Bluey: "There's a castle in London! We've gotta get to the airport!"
Bingo: "No, Bluey! I think it's a different castle!"
The shot cuts back to the sand castle in the backyard.
Bingo: "I think it's this one!"
Bluey bashes straight into the castle, destroying it. Afterwards, she begins digging a hole into the sand, squealing in excitement.
Bluey: "I hit something!"
Bingo: "Is it chocolate!?"
Bluey: "It is, it is!"
Bingo squeals. Have they finally found the easter eggs?
Bluey: "Wait...it isn't. It's toilet paper."
Bingo: "Aaaargh!"
Bluey: "Hang on, look! Eggs! It's another clue! Come on!"
Bluey runs off, with Bingo following. She falls into the hole Bluey dug, and giggles. The shot cuts to the bathroom, where they begin looking again.
Bluey: "You look over there!"
Bingo: "There's no eggs in here!"
Bluey: "There must be! Toilet paper belongs in the toilet! Unless...Oh, no!"
Bingo: "What?"
Bluey: "They might be in Dad's toilet!"
The pups gasp, with the camera zooming in on their fearful faces. The shot then cuts to Bandit on the toilet. Bluey and Bingo peek in.
Bandit: "Ugh...Bandit!"
Bluey: "Augh, it stinks!"
Bingo: "How are we gonna find the next clue?"
Bluey: "Someone has to go in there!"
Bingo: "But it stinks so much, we'll die!"
Bluey: "I know!"
Bingo: "Aww...there will be no Easter."
Bluey: "Yes there will be, Bingo. I'm going in!"
Bluey enters the bathroom, holding her breath.
Bluey: "Ugh, it stinks. I can't...do it..."
She falls to the ground, before she suddenly pops back up.
Bluey: "Wait!"
She looks at the mirror, where a drawing of Bluey and Bingo's bedroom window is present. The shot then cuts back to Bluey exiting the bathroom, coughing and catching a breath of fresh air.
Bingo: "Did you find it?"
Bluey gives Bingo a small note with a drawing of the window.
Bingo: "Oh, I know what this is!"
The shot cuts to the pups running into their bedroom. Bingo runs up to the window and holds the note over it.
Bingo: "It's our window! They must be in here!"
Bluey: "But we've already looked here! I don't understand!"
Bingo: "I do. He forgot us again."
Bingo sits down, discouraged. Bluey accepts defeat and sits down with her.
Bluey: "Maybe you're right, Bingo."
Bingo: "It's my fault, Bluey. I'm just a small, forgettable child."
Bluey: "No you're not, Bingo! You're a great child!"
Bingo: "Really?" 
Bluey: "Yes, you're smart! You figured out the castle clue all by yourself!"
Bingo: "Yeah, I did!"
Bluey: "It's me who's forgettable."
Bingo: "You are not! You're brave! You went into Dad's stinky toilet!"
Bluey: "Oh yeah, I did!"
Bluey stands back up.
Bluey: "We're not forgettable!"
Bingo: "Yeah, we're rememberable! 
The pups hug each other.
Bingo: "Happy Easter, Bluey."
Bluey: "Happy Easter, Bing-oooh! Look!"
Bluey points to the Easter decorations on the carpet. They're formed to resemble footprints.
Bingo: "Footprints! Bunny footprints!"
The Pups: "Easter Bunny footprints!"
The two squeal excitedly, running to follow the path. The path leads them to Bandit's workroom, where a lamp is set up right above the yoga ball. As Bluey moves the ball aside, they have finally found the Easter basket, full of chocolates and other goodies.
Bingo: "He remembered us!"
