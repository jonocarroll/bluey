The episode opens with a distant view of the Heeler house.
Bandit: (offscreen) "Oh, man."
Cut to the living room. Bandit lies on the couch. He stretches.
Yes/No Button: "Y-Yes!"
He reaches under his back and digs out the Yes/No button.
Bandit: "Peace and quiet..." 
He throws the button out of frame.
Yes/No Button: "No!"
He closes his eyes, and for a moment, all is silent.
Bluey: (off screen) "He-ey!"
Bandit's eyes snap open. Cut to a wider shot. Bluey walks slowly, holding a beanbag chair to her back. Bingo follows her.
Bluey: "Here comes my big bum!"
Bingo giggles. Bluey turns around, knocking Bingo down with her beanbag bum.
Bingo: "Ah!"
From the floor, Bingo squeals with laughter.
Bluey: "Oh, sorry Love. It wasn't me. It was my big beanbag bum."
She howls and waves the beanbag around, while Bingo continues squealing and laughing.
Bandit: (annoyed) "Girls, it was nice and quiet in here."
Bingo: "Not anymore!"
Bluey: "Oop!"
Bluey "accidentally" falls down, pinning Bingo to the floor with her beanbag bum.
Bandit: "Kids."
Bluey: "Okay, we'll go somewhere else."
She gets up and tries to run out of the room, but her beanbag bum gets stuck between the couch and a chair.
Bluey: "Ah! Hey, my big bum's stuck!"
Bingo laughs and tries to shove Bluey through the gap. Bluey starts howling again.
Bandit: "Kids!"
Bluey and Bingo stop and go silent.
Bandit: "Come on. You're too noisy!"
Bluey: "We're just playing."
Bandit: "Well, can't you play a quieter game?"
Bingo: "Like what?"
Bluey climbs over the beanbag and stands next to Bingo
Bandit: "Ooh, I know the best game ever!"
Bluey, Bingo: "What?"
Bandit: "You have to see how long you can go without making a single noise."
Bluey: "Ooh, okay!"
Bandit: "You ready?"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bandit "Okay... go!"
Bluey and Bingo stare ahead blankly, not moving or making a sound.
Bandit: "I think you've got the hang of it. See if you can make it 'til your thirteenth birthdays."
Bluey pats her sister to get her attention. When Bingo turns to her, she points at Bingo, then makes a stacking motion with her hands, and gestures invitingly. Bingo smiles and nods. They sit down next to a pile of blocks and begin to build a tower.
Bandit: "Bandit, you're a genius."
Bandit closes his eyes and relaxes. Suddenly, Chilli hurries in. She kicks the beanbag out of the way, and starts packing a backpack. She removes a couple of plush toys, and starts packing a laptop, tablet, and stationery.
Chilli: "Honey, Madge just rang in sick. I have to get to work."
Bandit: "I'll be on the couch."
Chilli: "No, I need you to go and buy a birthday present for Muffin."
Bandit: "Oh, Madge!"
Chilli: "Trixie said to get a Moonlight Unicorn. She collects them. But don't get one she's already got, okay, or she'll go bananas."
Bandit: "Well, how do I know which one she's already got?"
Chilli: "The kids know, don't you, girls?"
Bluey and Bingo nod in agreement
Chilli: "See? They'll tell you. Gotta go."
She closes the backpack and slings it on her back.
Chilli: "Hmm, it's quiet in here."
Chilli walks out.
Bandit: "Oh, biscuits."
TITLE CARD - The Quiet Game
Bluey: (whispering) "This episode of Bluey is called: The Quiet Game."
Cut to an intersection in the Brisbane central business district. In the foreground is a bookshop, a copy of Fruitbat displayed in a window. In the background, Cornelius holds hands with a woman; they both have ice cream cones. Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo walk out from behind the bookshop and continue down the sidewalk.
Bandit: "Oh, well, at least it's still nice and quiet."
In the background, Cornelius puts ten dollars in a panhandler's hat. Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo approach an ice cream cart.
Bandit: "Hey, you kids want some ice cream?"
Bluey nods happily, Bingo jumps for joy. Bandit pointedly doesn't look in their direction. He cups a hand to his ear.
Bandit: "Kids?"
Bluey and Bingo run in front of him and wave to get his attention. Bandit looks the other direction."
Bandit: "No?"
Bluey slouches, Bingo clasps her hands worriedly. Bandit shrugs.
Bandit: "Can't hear anything."
They follow after him - Bluey with folded arms, Bingo with hands on her hips. They both look annoyed. Behind them, the Busker stops at the ice cream stand.
Bandit: "Alright. Well, if you change your mind, just speak up."
They start up an escalator, entering a shopping centre. Bandit chuckles.
Bandit: "Oh, this is awesome."
As ascend the escalator and exit the scene, a car pulls up to the curb. A teenage dingo wearing a blue polo shirt gets out of the passenger side. His mum rolls down the window.
Alfie's Mum: "Good luck on your first day at work, Alfie! You're gonna do great! Trust me."
Alfie fidgets with his name tag.
Alfie: "How do you know I won't mess it all up?"
Alfie's Mum: "You won't. Just do your best and be as helpful as you can."
Alfie: "Okay, Mum." 
He puts on his badge and gets on the elevator as his mum drives off.
Cut to the interior of the department store. This section of the shop is dominated by stuffed toys. In the background, Jack Russell's Mum and Lulu discuss a pair of dress-up fairy wings. Bandit walks in, followed by Bluey and Bingo.
Bandit: "Alright, toy section. Uh, what's thing called again, kids?"
He examines a display of plush toys.
Bandit: "Moonbeam... something? Kids?"
He turns around. Bluey and Bingo smile at him, hands held behind their backs. They don't respond.
Bandit: "Oh, yeah, you're still playing the quiet game."
They nod.
Bandit: "Okay. Boop!"
Bandit pretends to press a button.
Bandit: "I paused the game so you can tell what toy Muffin wants."
Bluey and Bingo each waggle their index fingers at Bandit in admonition.
Bandit "Ugh! Look, at least nod if I get it right."
He picks up a plush ostrich.
Bandit: "What about this?"
They shake their heads. He puts it back and picks up a plush wombat.
Bandit: "How about this one?"
Bluey and Bingo shake their heads again.
Bandit: "Aw, give me a clue, come on!"
Bluey and Bingo look at each other excitedly, then run a bit further away from Bandit to make room for their performance. Bingo moves her arms, outlining a large circle.
Bandit: "Uh, okay, yeah, moon. Yes, I knew that one."
Bingo nods. Bluey and Bingo both point upward.
Bandit: "Uh, Moon... roof?"
Cut to a view of the ceiling. A sprinkler is centered in the frame, next to some pot lights.
Bandit: "No, Moon ceiling! Moon sprinkler?"
Cut back to a view of floor level. Bluey and Bingo pantomime a gut laugh. Bandit stops Alfie, who was walking past them.
Bandit: "Hey, mate, have you got a toy called a 'Moon Sprinkler?'"
Alfie: "Uhh... I don't know, sorry. It's my first day today. I can check out the back."
Bandit: "Thanks, mate."
Alfie walks off. Bandit turns back to Bluey and Bingo.
Bandit: "Okay, where was I?"
Bluey spreads her arms, directing attention to Bingo. Bingo repeats her circle-outline.
Bandit: "Moon."
Bluey then points to the headlights on a toy cement mixer truck.
Bandit: "Moon truck?"
Bluey rolls her eyes, and points at it more emphatically.
Bandit: "Moon headlight? Moon... light? Moonlight!"
Bluey and Bingo both give him a double thumbs-up.
Bandit: "Ous!"
Bandit pumps his arms in celebration. Bluey gestures to Bingo, who holds an index finger pointing out from her forehead as a horn, and trots back and forth.
Bandit: "Um... HORSE!"
Bingo pauses. Bluey shakes her head..
Bandit: "No, not horse."
Bluey points at Bingo's horn gesture.
Bandit: "That's a horn... horses don't have horns. Wait... UNICORN! MOONLIGHT UNICORN! Boom! Hahaha!"
Bandit pumps his arms in celebration, and the girls throw their hands up. Bandit looks around.
Bandit: "Okay, where are the Moonlight Unicorns?"
Smash cut to a shot of Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo, dwarfed by a huge wall of Moonlight Unicorn boxes.
Bandit: "There's thousands of them... and they're all different!"
He examines a few boxes.
Bandit: "Appledate, Pebbledasher... d'you know which one Muffin wants?"
Bluey and Bingo both nod.
Bandit: "Can you tell me?"
They both shake their heads.
Bandit: (muttering)"No, you can't tell me." (normally) "Can you point at it?"
They both shake their heads again.
Bandit: "Errgh! Look, kids, you win the Quiet Game, okay?! Hooray! Gold medal, gold medal."
He pretends to hang medals around Bluey and Bingo's necks, which they bow their heads to accept.
Bandit: "You can talk now."
They stare at him, silently smiling.
Bandit: "Errgh! Look, the Quiet Game isn't actually a real game. I made it up 'cause you kids were too noisy."
Bluey and Bingo throw their arms out, mouthing "What?!".
Bandit: "I'm sorry, I'm a dodgy dad..."
Bluey and Bingo nod their heads sternly.
Bandit: "So... that means you can talk now?"
Bluey and Bingo shake their heads.
Bandit: "Errgh! Forget this."
He grabs the nearest box. He reads the name.
Bandit: "Bramblehop. He'll do."
He walks off. Cut to the checkout. Bandit is second in line.
Bandit: "Sooo, Muffin gets a unicorn she's already got. What's the worst that can happen?"
Bluey pokes Bandit, getting his attention.
Bandit: Huh? 
Bluey takes the Moonlight Unicorn box. She and Bingo walk a few steps away, making room for a performance. Bluey picks up a party hat from a nearby display and puts it on Bingo. Bluey runs out of frame.
Bandit: "Okay."
He points at Bingo.
Bandit: "You're Muffin, got it."
Bluey returns, and offers the Moonlight Unicorn to Bingo. Bingo puts her hands to her cheeks in surprise.
Bandit: "It's your birthday. You get your present."
Bingo sits down cross-legged and pretends to tear wrapping paper off the box.
Bandit: "You unwrap it. It's Bramblehop."
Bingo looks at the package, and her look of excitement turns to a snarl of rage. She stands up and shakes both her fists in the air.
Bandit: "Oh. Boy."
Bingo throws the present to the ground and points accusingly at Bluey, who raises her arms defensively.
Bandit: "Oh."
Bingo chases Bluey in a circle, still shaking her fists.
Bandit: "Oh, well, that's not good."
Bingo throws herself on the ground, kicking and pounding her fists as Bluey looks on in faint concern. Bluey looks meaningfully at Bandit. Finished, Bingo stands up, and they both take a bow.
Bandit: "...Wow."
Cashier: "Can I help you?"
Bandit: "I'll be right back." 
He picks up the Moonlight Unicorn package and walks off.
Cut back to the wall of Moonlight Unicorns. Bandit puts the package back.
Bandit: "Alright, act out the name of the one Muffin wants and I'll guess it."
Bluey and Bingo look at each other excitedly, tails wagging. Bluey pantomimes writing on her palm. A moment later, Bingo begins flapping her arms.
Bandit: "Uh... writing... Writing bird... book. Book bird! Book chicken! Yes!"
Bandit turns to the wall of unicorns. Bluey stops him.
Bandit: "No, not book chicken."
Bluey and Bingo resume their acts with greater emphasis.
Bandit: "Hand, finger, finger chicken, chicken hands... Is it chicken hands?!"
Bluey and Bingo look at him with concern over his increasingly frantic guessing. Bandit drops to his knees, and Bluey and Bingo stop acting.
Bandit: Bandit: "Oh, Madge, why can't you take better care of yourself?"
Alfie walks up behind them.
Alfie: "Sorry sir, we don't have any 'Moon Sprinklers?' I'm not actually sure they exist."
Bandit stands back up.
Bandit: "Forget the sprinklers, I got a new problem. Muffin wants a unicorn thing, these kids know which one - I need you to figure it out."
Alfie: "Why don't you just ask them?"
Bandit: "Look..."
Bandit glances at Alfie's name tag.
Bandit: "...Alfie, you'll understand one day. Can you help me?"
A look of determination comes across Alfie's face.
Alfie: "Yes, I can help you."
Bandit puts his arm around Alfie's shoulder and pats his chest approvingly.
Bandit: "Good man, Alfie! Alright, action!"
Bluey and Bingo resume their pantomime; with Bluey writing on her palm, and Bingo flapping her arms. Bandit points at Bluey.
Bandit: "See, that one's writing. I think it's 'book', but I can't see any starting with book."
Bandit turns and examines the unicorns. Alfie crouches down and approaches Bluey.
Alfie: "You're definitely writing something, but not a book."
An adult and three kids come up behind Alfie, watching the game of charades with interest.
Alfie: "It's not what you're wri-ting, It's what you're writing with."
Alfie gasps, and points to Bluey's hands.
Alfie: "PEN!"
Bluey gives him a thumbs up, and Bingo raises her arms. Alfie pumps his arm, while the audience applauds.
Alfie, Bandit, Audience dogs: "Yeah!"
Bandit: "Good one, Alfie!"
Alfie taps his chin pensively. Bingo resumes flapping her arms.
Bandit: "Now, what about you?"
Bandit: "See, I thought it was a chicken or some sort of pheasant, maybe a partridge... is there a pen partridge?"
Alfie turns and shushes him.
Alfie: "Shh!"
Bandit (whispering) "Oh, yeah, sorry."
Alfie: "You've got wings like a bird... but they're big wings. C'mon, Alfie. You have to be helpful."
Bingo opens her mouth and silently pretends to yell.
Alfie: "Oh, you're squawking. No.. no, that's not squawking, that's... breathing... fire!"
Alfie stands up and grabs a Moonlight Unicorn.
Alfie: "Pendragon!"
Bingo: "Yes!"
The crowd, which has grown even larger, cheers.
Bandit: "Yes! You got it!"
Bluey: "Bingo! You spoke!"
Bingo: "So did you!"
Bluey: "Ah! I did!"
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: "Alfie, you ROCKSTAR!"
Bandit grabs Alfie from behind and lifts him up. Alfie smiles proudly.
Bluey, Bingo, Audience Dogs: "Alfie! Alfie! Alfie!"
A dog in a red polo shirt walks up. Bandit puts Alfie down.
Bandit: "Hey, mate, are you his boss?"
Alfie's Boss: "Yes?"
Bandit puts his arm around Alfie's shoulder and pulls him close.
Bandit: "Well, he's a legend!"
Bluey, Bingo, and the crowd cheer as the camera focuses on Alfie's satisfied, smiling face.
Cut back to the living room. Bingo and Bluey are wrapping the present on the floor, while Bandit, laying on the couch, fidgets with a tape dispenser.
Bluey: (shrilly) ♫ "Woo! Wrapping Muffin's present!!" ♫
Bingo: (shrilly) ♫ "Woo, we need some more sticky tapppeee!" ♫
Bandit: ♫ "Oh, here's some more!" ♫
Bandit hands the tape dispenser to Bingo."
Bingo: (shrilly) ♫ "Thank youuuuuuu!" ♫
Chilli walks in.
Chilli: "I'm back!"
Bandit, Bingo, Bluey: ♫ "Oooh, mother is bacckk!" ♫ 
Bandit: ♫ "How's Maddggge?" ♫ 
Chilli: "Wow, it's loud in here!"
Bluey: ♫ "We like it louddddd!" ♫ 
Chilli: "Well, maybe just a little quieter for your poor dad?"
Bandit: "Ah, I'm fine."
He rubs Bingo's head affectionately. Bluey and Bingo's tails wag.
Bandit: "It's music to my ears."
The "Beanbag Bum" music plays over the end credits. Bluey shakes her beanbag bum back and forth.
