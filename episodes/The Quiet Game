The episode opens with a distant view of the Heeler house, then cuts to Bandit on the living room couch as he is about to lie down.
Bandit: "Oh, man." He feels a Yes/No button, which makes a sound as he lies on it: "Y-Y-Y-Yes" "Peace and quiet." Throws the button; the button says "No". He proceeds to lie down. Suddenly, he is awakened by...
Bluey: "Hey! Check out my big bum!"
Scene shows Bluey and Bingo playing around with Bluey's "big bum", which is really a beanbag she holds behind her
Bingo: She giggles, as she gets knocked down by Bluey's "bum" "Ah!"
Bluey: "Oh, sorry Love. Wasn't me. It was my big beanbag bum." She howls
Bingo squeals
Bandit, annoyed: "Girls, it was nice and quiet in here!"
Bingo: "Not anymore!"
Bluey: "Oop!" Sits on Bingo as she giggles
Bandit: "Kids!"
Bluey: "Ok, we'll go somewhere else." She tries to go between the couch and a chair, only to have her "bum" stuck "Ah! Hey, my big bum's stuck!"
Bingo laughs as she tries to help Bluey. Bluey howls again.
Bandit: "Kids! Come on. You're too noisy!"
Bluey: "We're just playing."
Bandit: "Well, can't you play a quieter game?"
Bingo "Like what?"
Bluey climbs over the beanbag and stands next to Bingo
Bandit: "Ooh, I know the best game ever!"
Bluey and Bingo: "What?"
Bandit: "You have to see how long you can go without making a single noise."
Bluey, enthusiastically: "Ooh, OK!"
Bandit: "You ready?"
Bluey and Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bandit "OK, go!"
The "Quiet Game" begins; the girls just blankly stare and not making a sound.
Bandit: "I think you've got the hang of it. See if you can make it till your 13th birthdays."
Bluey pats her sister to get her attention, then makes a sign to ask whether she would like to make a block tower. Bingo nods. The two head to a pile of blocks in the middle of the living room.
Bandit: "Bandit, you're a genius." He lies down.
Chilli: "Honey, Madge just rang in sick. I have to get to work." While she is talking to Bandit, she is packing her bag, which involves removing a couple of stuffed toys
Bandit: "I'll be on the couch."
Chilli: "No, I need you to go and buy a birthday present for Muffin."
Bandit: "Oh, Madge!"
Chilli: "Trixie said to get a Moonlight Unicorn. She collects them. But don't get one she's already got, OK? Or she'll go bananas."
Bandit: "Well, how do I know which one she's already got?"
Chilli: "The kids know, don't you, girls?"
The girls nod in agreement
Chilli: "See? They'll tell you. Gotta go." She picks up bag and leaves "Hmm, it's quiet in here."
Bandit, feeling doomed: "Oh, biscuits."
TITLE CARD: THE QUIET GAME
Bluey, whispering: "This episode of Bluey is called "The Quiet Game"."
END TITLE CARD
It cuts to the city, with several people being seen during the scene.
Bandit: "Oh, well, at least it's still nice and quiet." He looks at an ice cream cart "Hey, you kids want some ice cream?"
The girls jump in excitement and agreement, but Bandit ignores them because he doesn't hear anything
Bandit: "Kids?"
The girls run in front of the cart to get his attention. Again, Bandit ignores them.
Bandit: "No? Can't hear anything."
The girls give up and walk back behind their dad, disappointed
Bandit: "Alright. Well, if you change your mind, just speak up." He chuckled "Oh, this is awesome."
The three ascend an escalator. Meanwhile, a car is parked just near the escalator the Heelers took. A young dog gets out of the car driven by his Mum.
Alfie's Mum: "Good luck on your first day at work, Alfie! You're gonna do great! Trust me."
Alfie: "How do you know I won't mess it all up?"
Alfie's Mum: "You won't. Just do your best and be as helpful as you can."
Alfie: "Okay, Mum." He gets up the elevator as his mum drives off.
Inside the department store.
Bandit: "Alright, toy section. Ah, what's thing called again, kids? Moonbeam, something? Kids?"
The kids don't respond.
Bandit: "Oh, yeah, you're still playing the quiet game."
The kids nod.
Bandit: "Okay. Boop! Un-paused the game so you can tell what to Muffin wants."
The kids wag their fingers.
Bandit, annoyed: "Ugh! Look, at least nod when I get it right. He picks up a toy. "What about this?"
The kids shake their heads
Bandit: He picks up another. "How about this one?"
The kids shake their heads again
Bandit: "Ah, give me a clue, come on!"
The kids look at each other excitedly, then run a bit further away from Bandit so he can see them acting it out. Bingo makes her first move by making what looks like a circle
Bandit: "Moon. Yes, I need that one."
Bingo nods, then Bingo and Bluey point to the ceiling, trying to depict light.
Bandit: "Uh.. Moon roof? No, Moon ceiling! Moon sprinkler?"
Bingo and Bluey act out laughing. Bandit proceeds to ask Alfie.
Bandit: "Hey mate, Do you have a toy called Moon Sprinkler?"
Alfie: "Uhh, I don't know, sorry. It's my first day today, I can check out the back."
Bandit: "Thanks mate." He turns back to Bluey and Bingo "Now where were we?"
Bluey depicts her arms horizontally, one going up and the other going down, while Bingo is depicting something that looks like a circle. Both using gestures.
Bandit: "Moon."
Bluey then points to a trucks headlamp.
Bandit: "Moon truck?"
Bluey rolls her eyes, and points at it harder.
Bandit: "Moon headlight? Moon light? Moonlight!"
Bluey and Bingo both do a thumbs up.
Bandit says something inaudible.
Bluey shows as Bingo depicts herself as a unicorn, galloping with her finger pointed up of her head as a horn.
Bandit: "Uhm.. HORSE!"
Bluey shakes her head, Bingo stops, but still depicting herself being a unicorn.
Bandit: "No, not horse, that one has a horn, horses don't have horns. Wait. UNICORN! MOONLIGHT UNICORN! Boom! Hahaha!" He looks around "Ok, now where are the Moonlight Unicorns."
It cuts to shelves filled with Moonlight Unicorns. All what looks like it being different from each and every one.
Bandit: "There's thousands of them, and they're all different! Appledale, Pebbledasher, y'do you know what Muffin wants?"
They both nod.
Bandit: "Can you tell me?"
They both shake their heads.
Bandit: "Oh you can't tell me. Can you point at it?"
They both shake their heads again.
Bandit: "Errgh! Look kids, you and the Quiet Game ok. You win, Hurray!! Gold Medal Gold Medal" He pretends to put gold medals on the girls. "You can talk now."
No response from either from them.
Bandit: "Errgh! The Quiet Game isn't actually a real game, I made it up because you kids were too noisy."
Bluey and Bingo depict themselves in a shocked manner.
Bandit: "I'm sorry, I'm a dodgy dad."
Bluey and Bingo do something uh, I cannot describe, like a bowing movement?
Bandit: "So that means you can talk now?"
Bluey and Bingo shake their heads.
Bandit: "Errgh! Forget this." He reads the Moonlight Unicorn's name on the box "Bramblehop, eh that'll do."
It cuts to a registration area.
Bandit: "So Muffin gets a unicorn that she's already got, what's the worst that can happen?"
Bluey pokes Bandit a few times, grabbing his attention before grabbing the package, Bluey puts on a party hat for Bingo before Bluey runs.
Bandit: "Ok your Muffin, got it, it's your birthday. You get your present and unwrap it. It's Bramblehop."
During the entire sequence Bandit saying that, Bluey is depicted as the party guest, giving the present to unwrap it for Bingo, pretending to be Muffin. She pretends to unwrap the present, looks at the box, and then proceeding to get angry.
Bandit: "Oh, boy."
The next sequence is that Bingo pretending to be Muffin throws the present to the ground, and proceeding to chase the "party guest".
Bandit: "Oh that's not good."
The final sequence is still chasing, and then throwing into a temper tantrum, before Bingo getting up, and both of them bowing.
Bandit: "Wow."
Cashier: "Can I help you?"
Bandit: "I'll be right back." He picks up the Moonlight Unicorn package and puts it back, cutting there within shots in the process.
Bandit: "Alright, act out the name Muffin wants and I'll guess it."
Again, as I'll mention but in a similar manner, The kids look at each other excitedly, and then begin acting, Bluey is writing something, then Bingo acts like a type of flying bird animal.
Bandit: "Writing.. Writing bird.. book, Book bird! Book chicken! Yes!"
Bluey stops Bandit from grabbing a Moonlight Unicorn package. The acting Bluey and Bingo do intensifies.
Bandit: "No, not Book Chicken. Hand, finger, finger chicken, chicken head, Is it chicken heads?! Oh Madge, Why can't you take better care of yourselves?!"
Alfie walks in, and Bluey and Bingo stop acting.
Alfie: "Sorry sir, but we don't have any "Moon Sprinklers?" I'm not actually sure they exist."
Bandit: "Forget the sprinklers, I got a new problem. Muffin wants a unicorn thing, these kids know which one, I need you to figure it out."
Alfie: "Why don't you just ask them?
Bandit: "Look.." He takes a glance at the name tag "Alfie, You'll understand what, Can you help me."
Alfie: "Yes, I can help you."
Bandit: "Good man Alfie! Alright, Action!"
Bluey and Bingo act like what they did earlier; Bluey writing something and Bingo acting like a flying bird thing.
Bandit: "See, that one is writing, I think it's book, but I can't find any starting with book." He looked through the shelves.
Alfie approaches Bluey, observing what she is acting out.
Alfie: "You're definitely writing something, but not a book, It's not what you're wri-TING, It's what you're writing with.." He gasps "Pen!"
At this point, a crowd formed, they cheer Alfie and applause.
Bandit: "Yea! Good one Alfie!"
Alfie: He then observes what Bingo is acting out. "Now what about you?"
Bandit: "See I thought it was a chicken or some sort of pheasant, maybe a partridge, is there a pen partridge"
Alfie: "Shh!"
Bandit, whispering: "Oh, yea sorry."
Alfie: Still observing Bingo on what she's acting "You've got wings like a bird, But their big wings. C'mon Alfie, you have to be helpful."
Bingo then starts to "squawk", which is supposed to mean breathing fire.
Alfie: "Oh, you're squawking, No.. no that's not squawking, That's.. breathing.. Fire!"
Alfie looks through the shelves and pulls out the Pendragon Moonlight Unicorn package.
Alfie: "Pendragon!"
Bingo: "Yes!"
Bandit, along with the crowd: "Yes!"
Bandit: "We got em!"
(It appears Bingo spoke.)"
Bluey: "Bingo! You spoke!"
(It appears Bluey spoke too.)"
Bingo: "So did you!"
Bluey: "Ah! I did!"
Both of them laugh.
Bandit: "Alfie you rockstar!" Proceeding to carry Alfie up
Bluey, Bingo and the crowd: "Alfie! Alfie! Alfie!"
Bandit: He puts down Alfie "Hey man are you his boss?"
Alfie's Boss: "Yes?"
Bandit: "Well he's a legend!"
Bluey, Bingo and the whole crowd cheer on to Alfie's success, as Alfie's face turns into a smile.
It then cuts to the distant view of the Heeler Home, but fore cutting back to the living room.
Bluey, in an opera sounding voice: "Woo! Wrapping Muffin's present!!"
Bingo, in an opera sounding voice: "Woo we need some more sticky tapppeee!"
Bandit, in an opera sounding voice: "Oh here's some more!" He gives the tape to Bingo
Chilli: "I'm back!"
Bandit, Bingo, and Bluey in unison: "Oooh mother is bacckk!"
Bandit: "How Maddggge?"
Chilli: "Wow, it's loud in here!"
Bluey: "We like it loudd!"
Chilli: "Maybe just a little quieter for your poor dad?"
Bandit: "Ah, I'm fine, It's music to my ears." Rubbing Bingo's head while he is lying on the couch.
The credits roll out, with Bluey having dancing with her big beanbag bum, with the same "motif" playing in the beginning where Bluey and Bingo pretending that Bluey had a big bum.
