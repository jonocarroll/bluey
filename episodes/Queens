Chilli is scrubbing the deck. Bandit is holding a rake.
Bluey: Mum, can you play with me? 
Chilli: No, I have to clean the lorikeet poo off the deck. 
Bluey: Ew! 
Chilli: Well, it's gotta be done. 
Bluey: Wouldn't you rather play? It looks like hard work. 
Chilli: Your mum's not afraid of a bit of hard work. 
Bluey: Hmm. 
Bingo runs in, holding a plastic crown.
Bingo: Bluey, let's play queens! 
Bluey: Yeah, queens!
