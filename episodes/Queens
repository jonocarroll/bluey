The episode opens with a wide shot of the house.
Cut to the play room. Chilli is on her hands and knees outside on the verandah, wearing a pair of rubber gloves. She scrubs the deck with a brush. Bandit walks by in the background, carrying a rake. Bluey runs up to Chilli.
Bluey: "Mum, can you play with me?"
Chilli: "No, I have to clean the lorikeet poo off the deck."
Bluey takes a step back.
Bluey: "Ew."
Chilli: "Well, it's gotta be done."
Bluey: "Wouldn't you rather play? It looks like hard work."
Chilli: "Your mum's not afraid of a bit of hard work."
Bluey: (thoughtful) "Mm."
Bingo runs up with a toy crown.
Bingo: "Bluey, let's play Queens."
Bluey: "Yeah, Queens!"
TITLE CARD: Queens
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Queens."
Bluey steps into the entrance of the playroom, holding a recorder. She plays three notes.
Bluey: "Everyone, the Queen is coming in."
Bluey giggles and goes back into the hall. A moment later, Bingo enters, walking slowly. She is wearing the toy crown, carrying a magnifying glass as a scepter, and wearing the rainbow cloth from the roof of the play house as a mantle. Bluey follows behind her, carrying the end of the tower so it does not drag on the floor.
Chilli: (British accent) "Oh, it's the Queen."
She pauses her cleaning and waves to Bingo.
Chilli: (British accent) "Your Majesty, over here."
Bingo: (poshly) "Oh, hello."
Chilli: (British accent) "Oh, I love you, Your Majesty."
Bingo: (poshly) "Carry on."
They walk up to a throne in the center of the room, constructed from cushions.
Bingo: (poshly) "Stop. Butler, the royal bottom is itchy. I demand you scratch it."
Bingo leans forward. Bluey laughs and scratches Bingo's bottom.
Bingo: (poshly) "Oh, yes, that's the spot. Very good. Now, I demand to sit on the throne."
Bluey giggles.
Bluey: "Yes, my queen."
Bluey unties the cloth from Bingo's shoulders, and lays it on the floor as a carpet leading to the throne. Bingo walks down it, then climbs onto the chair. She kicks over one of the cushions.
Bingo: (poshly) "Oopsie."
Bluey: "Oh, let me get that, Your Majesty."
Bluey sets the cushion back in position. Bingo, still trying to climb onto the seat, knocks over another cushion. Bluey runs over and sets it upright.
Bingo: (giggling) "The queen's having some trouble."
Bluey gives Bingo a boost onto the throne.
Bingo: (poshly) "Splendid."
Bingo claps twice, and Bluey stands to attention, tail wagging.
Bingo: (poshly) "Now, go away."
Bluey bows.
Bluey: "Yes, my queen."
Bluey runs over to the corner, and sits down on a stool. She giggles. Bingo claps twice.
Bingo: (poshly) "Come here."
Bluey runs up to Bingo.
Bluey: "Yes, Your Ma—"
Bingo: (poshly) "Oh, excuse me. You may not stand on the royal rainbow thing."
Bluey takes a step back, off the rainbow cloth.
Bluey: "Ooh, I'm terribly sorry, Your Majesty."
Bingo: (poshly) "Cheeky butler."
Bluey grabs a pair of wooden blocks, and places them on the rainbow cloth, then stands on the blocks.
Bluey: "Is this okay, Your Majesty?"
Bingo inspects Bluey's feet with the magnifying glass.
Bingo: (poshly) "Yes."
Bluey: "How can I serve you, my queen?"
Bingo: (poshly) "Oh, I'm going to sing a song. You will write it down."
Bluey: "Ooh, okay."
Bingo clears her throat. Bluey pretends to write on a notepad.
Bingo: (poshly) ♫ "I am so beautiful" ♫
Bingo: (poshly) ♫ "I am so lovely" ♫
Bingo: (poshly) ♫ "Ooh, and sparkly" ♫
Bingo: (poshly) "Now, sing it back to me."
Bluey clears her throat.
Bluey: ♫ "I am so beautiful" ♫
Bingo: (poshly) "Louder."
Bluey: (higher pitched) ♫ "I am so—" ♫
Bingo: (poshly) "Louder."
Bluey: (louder) ♫ "Lovely and sparkly" ♫
Bingo: (poshly) "Very good."
Chilli appllauds.
Chilli: (British accent) "Oh, our queen is so lovely and sparkly."
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bingo: (poshly) "Bring me the royal carriage."
Cut to the kitchen. Plush toys have been arranged to form an adoring crowd. Bluey and Bingo enter, with Bingo riding on a car seat, which Bluey is pulling by a safety strap. Bingo waves to the crowd.
Bingo: (poshly) "Hello."
Cut to the verandah. Bingo and a plush dog with a crown are having a tea party. Bluey pretends to pour tea for them.
Bingo: (poshly) "More. More. That's too much!"
Bluey laughs.
Cut to Bandit's office. More plush toys have been arranged in a line for a meet-and-greet. Some of them have been bandaged. Bingo shakes the hand of Polly Puppy, who is wearing Bluey's hat with the brim pinned up, army style.
Bingo: (poshly) "That must be very interesting."
She moves on to the next toy, a frog with a bandaged arm.
Bluey: (stage whispering) "This is Sir Frog Dog. He's half frog."
Bingo shakes his hand.
Bingo: (poshly) "Ah, that must be very interesting."
Cut to the hallway. They are playing polo - Bluey gives Bingo a piggyback ride, as she swings a field hockey stick at a tennis ball.
Bingo: (poshly) "Faster, butler!"
She swings the hockey stick and they both fall down. Bluey squeals, and they both laugh.
Bluey: "Hey, Bingo, can I have a turn at being queen?"
Bingo: "Okay."
Cut back to Chilli scrubbing the verandah outside the playroom.
Bingo arrives at the door and blows a single note on the recorder.
Bingo: "Here comes the queen!"
Bluey enters in the royal regalia.
Chilli: (British accent) "Oh, a new queen. We love you, Your Majesty."
Bluey: (poshly) "Yes, yes."
Bingo takes the cloth from Bluey's shoulders and lays it out as a carpet. Bluey walks to the throne and sits down. Bingo puts the blocks on the rainbow cloth and stands on them unsteadily
Bingo: "How can I serve you, Your Maj... whoa, uh—"
Bingo falls off and lands on her bottom. Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bluey jumps down from the throne and offers the crown to Bingo.
Bluey: "Actually, you can be queen again, Bingo. I like being the butler better."
Bingo: "Aw, but I like being the butler. You get to walk on the butler blocks."
Bluey: "Uh, maybe we can both be butlers?"
Bingo: "Okay."
Cut to a close-up shot of the rainbow cloth. Bluey's hands place two more blocks on it. Her feet stand on the blocks.
Cut back to the regular shot. Both Bluey and Bingo stand on blocks on the rainbow cloth. The music stops.
Bluey: "This isn't working."
Bingo: "Yeah, butlers need someone to boss them around."
Offscreen, Bandit can be heard grunting.
Cut to a view of the back yard through the play room doors. Bandit drags a bin bag full of palm fronds up to the back porch.
Bandit: "I swear. If Lucky's Dad's palm tree drops one more branch in my yard..."
Bandit strikes the ground with his rake and looks back at Lucky's Dad's palm tree angrily. Bluey and Bingo turn to each other, excited.
Bluey and Bingo: "Yes."
Cut to the center of the play room. Bandit lounges on the throne, wearing the crown over one ear, and carrying his rake as a staff. He rests his feet on Bingo, who is on all fours on the butler blocks, serving as an ottoman.
Bandit: (falsetto) "Butler."
Bluey: (laughing) "Yes, Your Majesty?"
Bandit rattles a tumbler with a few ice cubes in it.
Bandit: (falsetto) "The Queen's ginger beer is empty."
Bluey runs up, takes the tumbler, and runs out of the room.
Bandit: (gruffly) "Hurry!"
Chilli: "The royal poo scrubber could use a ginger beer."
Bandit: (falsetto) "Back to work, peasant."
Chilli gives Bandit her signature glare.
Bandit: (weakly) "I mean... carry on?"
Chilli, unimpressed, returns to scrubbing the deck.
Cut to a view of the back yard over Bandit's shoulder. Pat trims the hedges with an electric trimmer. A palm frond falls off his tree into the Heelers' yard, landing with a thump.
Pat: "Ah, another one for your collection, Bandit!"
Cut back to a close-up of Bandit's face. He glares, as off screen, Pat laughs at his own joke.
Bandit: "For too long, Lucky's Dad's palm tree has been dropping leaves into my kingdom."
Bandit stands and brandishes his rake.
Bandit: "Well, NO MORE, by Toutatis!"
He charges off, into the back yard.
Bandit: "Yaaaa-haha!"
Bingo watches from the porch as wooden thumping noises and Pat's yells and laughs come from off screen. Bluey walks up with the refilled tumbler of ginger beer.
Bluey: "Where's the queen?"
Bingo points out into the yard.
Bingo: "She went crazy."
Bluey: "Oh."
Bingo: "Can you be the queen, Bluey? I really want a turn being butler."
Bluey: "Well, it's just... I don't like being the queen."
Bingo: (sadly) "Aw, but I was queen for you for ages."
Bluey: (reluctantly) "Um, okay."
Bluey climbs back onto the throne.
Bluey: (unenthusiastically) "Go and get the queen a pillow."
Bingo: (sadly) "Aw, you're not doing it properly."
Bingo runs off. Bluey sighs and rests her head on her hand.
Chilli walks up
Chilli: (British accent)(hesitantly) "Uh, Your Majesty. May I have that ginger beer if Your Grace isn't drinking it?"
Bluey: (flatly) "Yes."
She takes the ginger beer, bowing over it.
Chilli: (British accent) "Oh, bless you, Your Majesty, bless you! And thank you for looking after us all!"
Bluey: (flatly) "You're welcome."
Chilli: (British accent) "Oh, it must be nice being the queen."
Bluey: "Actually, it's not."
Chilli: (British accent) "Really?"
Bluey: "No, I'd rather be the butler."
Chilli: (British accent) "Guess you do have a lot of royal subjects to take care of. And you're always having to do things you don't want to. That must be hard work."
Bluey: "Yes, it's a big job."
The camera zooms in on Chilli's face.
Chilli: "Don't you ever feel like running off to play?"
Bluey's eyes open wide.
Bluey: "A queen does not just 'run off to play.'"
Chilli: "Oh, no, Your Majesty, I-I didn't mean—"
Bluey waves her finger in the air angrily.
Bluey: "The Queen is not afraid of a bit of hard work."
Bluey: "In fact..."
Bluey claps twice.
Bluey: (poshly) "Butler!"
Bingo stands up from where she had been leaning against a bean bag chair that forms part of the throne.
Bingo: "Yes, Your Majesty."
Bluey: "Bring me that ginger beer."
Bingo: "Okay!"
Laughing, Bingo leaps over the rainbow cloth. She takes the ginger beer from Chilli and gives it to Bluey.
Bluey: (poshly) "And one has a new song. Ready?"
Bingo: "Ready, Your Majesty."
Bingo pretends to write in a notebook.
Bluey: (poshly) ♫ "One is the queen" ♫
Bluey: (poshly) ♫ "One doesn't like being the queen" ♫
Bluey: (poshly) ♫ "But one does it anyway" ♫
Cut to the kitchen. Bingo drags Bluey past the crowd of stuffed animals on the car seat. Bluey waves.
Bluey: (poshly) "Oh, hello."
Cut to the back yard. Bluey stands atop Bandit, who looks annoyed. Pat kneels as Bluey taps his shoulders, knighting him. Bingo watches.
Cut to the verandah. Bluey has tea with the crowned plush dog, while Bingo pours their tea.
Cut to Bandit's office. Bluey shakes Sir Frog Dog's hand.
Cut back to the play room. Bluey walks over to the throne while Bingo carries the end of her mantle.
Bluey: "Have you had a good turn as butler now, Bingo?"
Bingo: "Yeah. Thanks, Bluey."
Bluey sets the crown and magnifying glass on the floor, then unties the mantle.
Bingo: "Do you want to be butler again?"
Bluey: "Yes, please."
Chilli: (off screen) "Finished."
Cut to Chilli standing on the back porch, wiping sweat from her brow. The sun is behind her, surrounding her with an aureole.
Chilli: (British accent) "Finally."
Chilli stretches.
Bluey: "Ooh, wait. I know how we can both be butlers."
Cut to the playroom entrance. Bluey and Bingo both come in, and blow a few notes on their recorders.
Bluey: "Please welcome your new queen."
Bluey and Bingo laugh and run back out through the door. A moment later, Chilli enters, dressed up as the queen. Bluey and Bingo carry the end of her mantle. Bandit cheers from the verandah.
Bandit: "We love you, Your Majesty!"
Chilli smiles excitedly as Bluey takes off the rainbow cloth and lays it out as a carpet. Chilli sits on the throne. Bluey bows as Bingo brings Chilli a ginger beer.
Bluey: "We are your butlers, Your Majesty."
Bingo: "We will bring you anything you want."
Chilli: (British accent) "You mean, I can have anything I want?"
Bingo: "Anything you want."
Bluey: "Because we are not afraid of a bit of hard work."
Chilli relaxes, lounging in the throne.
Chilli: "Ahhh. Very good."
Bluey dances as a recorder and harpsichord arrangement of the episode theme plays over the end credits.
