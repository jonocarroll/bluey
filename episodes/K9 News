TITLE CARD: K9 News
An establishing shot shows Glasshouse Primary School. A chicken runs across the yard.
Snickers sits behind a stump, as though it were a news desk.
Snickers: "Welcome back to K9 News. I'm your news anchor, Snickers."
He pauses for a beat, and then turns as though facing another camera. The scene cuts to the new camera angle.
Snickers: "Tonight's top story: how deep can one hole go."
He turns back to the original camera.
Snickers: "Our fuzzy dog on the street, Snickers, has the story.
Snickers puts on his hat and runs out of frame, laughing.
The scene cuts to the sand pit. Mackenzie's tail can be seen poking out of a hole, which he continues to throw sand out of. Snickers runs into the shot a moment later, panting. He takes a moment to catch his breath.
Snickers: (panting heavily) "Huh... huh... Ughhh."
Snickers snaps into his news anchor persona, pretending to hold a microphone in one hand, and touch an earpiece with the other.
Snickers: "That's right, Snickers. The dig continues."
Snickers turns to face the hole.
Snickers: "How much deeper will you go, Mackenzie?"
A plastic thump sounds out.
Mackenzie (off screen) "Aah! I hit the bottom!"
Snickers: "Incredible. Back to you, Snickers."
He runs out of frame.
Back at the stump, he runs in panting. He sits down, takes off the hat, and brushes himself off.
Snickers: "Thanks for that, Snickers. Onto the traffic report. How's it looking out there today, Snickers?"
He runs off screen.
The scene cuts to Bluey, playing helicopter on another stump. Snickers sits in the passenger position.
Snickers: "Well, Snickers, it's pretty wild out here."
The camera pulls back. The Terriers are jumping in a circle going "Boing!" Jack and Rusty watch.
Snickers: "There's a bunch of kangaroos on the freeway!"
Rusty: "Ugh! They're everywhere!"
The scene cuts back to Snickers at the news desk.
Snickers: "Oh-ho, no. I'd hate to be in their shoes. Now, to Snickers, with the weather."
The scene cuts to Snickers, standing near the tree fort. The wind is blowing heavily.
Snickers: "IT'S WINDY!"
His hat blows off.
Snickers: "Aah! No!"
He chases after it.
The scene cuts back to the news desk. A few leaves drift through the air, as Snickers brushes himself off.
Snickers: "Well, that's it for K9 News. Good night, and keep those tails waggin'."
The camera cuts to a side shot, showing that Winton has been sitting on the ground, serving as the audience. He claps.
The Bluey and Ludo Studio logs are shown.
