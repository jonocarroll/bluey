The episode opens with a view of the Heeler house. In the dining room, Bingo is acting out a song with her breakfast as she sings.
Bingo: ♫ "I'm a digger, strong and tough. Beep, beep, beep, get out of my way! I need to dig the ground today." ♫
Bandit, who is sitting at the table with Bingo, yawns.
Bandit: "What's today, kiddo?"
Bingo: "It's the weekend?"
Bandit: "That's right! How many games should we play?"
Bingo extends her arms all the way.
Bingo: "This many!"
Bandit: "Whoa, okay. That's doable."
Bluey walks in, holding an envelope with a claw toy.
Bluey: "I've got a letter for you."
Bandit: "Ah, thanks Bluey. What have we got here?"
Bandit opens the envelope to find a toy drumstick.
Bluey: "It's a drumstick."
Bandit: "Oh, you beauty!"
Bandit drums on the table, beatboxing. Bluey in Bingo join in, dancing.
TITLE CARD - The Weekend
Bingo : This episode of Bluey is called: The Weekend."
In the living room, the TV is showing a cricket match.
Commentator: "Seventh for two-hundred seventy-nine..."
In the sunroom, Bluey and Bingo are laughing while holding down Bandit.
Bluey: "Don't let him get up!"
Bingo: "You're not getting up, ever!"
Bluey: "Stay on him! You're not going anywhere you wild beast!"
Chilli walks through with a phone strapped to her arm.
Chilli: "I'm just going for a run! I'll see you later."
Chilli walks off.
Bingo: "Bye, Mum!"
Bluey: "See ya, Mum!"
Bandit: "Let me up!"
Bingo: "No, you're not getting up!"
Bandit: "I've got to give your mum a kiss. Oof!"
Bluey: "No smoochy kiss for you."
Bandit: "Oh, no! Hang on, hang on! Shh, shh!"
The kids stop for a moment as Bandit listens to the TV.
Commentator: "Boyd is out, the first ball after..."
Bandit: "Okay, I've... I've actually gotta watch this."
Bingo: "Get his legs! Get his legs!"
Bluey: "Noooo! Get his legs, Bingo!"
Bandit: "I just want to see this wicket."
Bandit carries his kids over to the living room, where he stands in front of the TV.
Bluey: "Hey Bingo, you wanna play statues?"
Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bluey and Bingo get themselves free of Bandit and run off.
Bandit: "How is that LBW?"
Cut to the stairs, where Bluey has set up a statue shop. Bingo is acting as a statue.
Bluey: "Dad!"
Bandit: (off screen) "Coming!"
Bluey: "Dad!"
Bandit: (off screen) "Yeah, I'm coming!"
Bluey: "DAAAD!!!!"
Bandit arrives.
Bandit: "Okay, okay. Bonjour!"
Bluey: "Oh, hello, would you like to buy a statue?"
Bingo wobbles.
Bandit: "Ah, yes. I definitely would like to buy a statue. I— wait a minute. These aren't magic statues, are they?"
Bluey: "Oh, no. These aren't magic. These are just normal statues."
Bandit: "Oh, good, 'cause I've been down that road before."
Bandit realises something.
Bandit: "Whoop, pause the game."
He mimes pressing a button.
Bandit: "Beep!"
Cut to the bathroom. Bandit sits on the toilet, fiddling with his phone. Bluey leans on the wall, reading a book. Bingo sings as she unrolls the toilet paper.
Bingo: ♫ "Bilby's digging, bilby's digging, cockatoo, cockatoo..." ♫
Bluey: "Phwoar, it stinks!"
Bandit: "Well, you're welcome to wait outside, kiddo."
Cut back to the stairs. Bandit mimes pressing the button again.
Bandit: "Boop! Unpause. Okay, I'd like that one please."
Bluey: "400 dollarydoos."
Bandit pretends to hand her some money.
Bandit: "Thank you."
Bluey: "Enjoy your statue!"
Bluey laughs.
Bandit carries Bingo (who is still acting as a statue) to the entryway.
Bandit: "Now, where am I gonna put this statue? Ah, yes, just here."
Bandit puts Bingo down near a table.
Bandit: "Oh, I forgot my change."
Bandit walks off.
Bluey: (off screen) "Hi!"
Bandit: (off screen) "I think I forgot my change. "
Meanwhile, Bingo moves from near the table to on top of a chair, giggling.
Bluey: (off screen) "Oh yes, sir, here you go."
Bandit: (off screen) "Thank you, shopkeeper. I'll just get back to my statue..."
Bandit walks over to where Bingo was.
Bandit: "...which I'm sure is right over here— What? What's it doing over here? I could've sworn I left it over there. Oh well. I guess I'll just put it back."
Bandit hums as he puts Bingo back. Bluey enters.
Bluey: "Is everything okay?"
Bandit: "I think so. I could've sworn I left the statue here, but I found it over there."
Bluey: "Well... you're probably just going crazy or something."
Bandit: "Oh yes, probably."
Bingo runs out the door, which slams, getting Bandit's attention.
Bandit: "Huh?"
Outside, Bingo walks down the front steps and resumes her statue pose next to the birdbath.
Bandit: (from inside) "What's going on here? Where's my statue?"
Bandit walks out towards Bingo, Bluey following.
Bandit: "Hey, how did you get out here? There's definitely something weird going on."
Bingo blows a raspberry and freezes again.
Bandit: "What?! Grrr! This is a magic statue! I knew it! You sold me magic statues!"
Bluey runs off and Bandit begins chasing her around the house to the playroom, which Bluey runs into.
Bandit: "You get back here! Grrr!"
Bandit re-enters the entryway, looking for Bluey.
Bandit: "Where are you, you little reprobates?"
The doorbell rings.
Bandit: "Oh, someone's at the door!"
Outside, Bluey and Bingo stand on either side of the door, hiding. Bandit opens the door.
Bandit: "Hello! Oh, what?"
Bluey and Bingo begin giggling.
Bandit: "That's strange... I thought someone rang the doorbell. Oh well, I'll just go back inside and carry on with my current tasks."
Bandit closes the door. Bluey and Bingo laugh as Bluey rushes over to where Bingo is to ring the doorbell again. She then rushes back before Bandit can open the door.
Bandit: "Hello. Huh? What? That's twice, now, and there's no one here!"
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "Certainly a very strange occurrence."
Bandit closes the door again. Bluey and Bingo laugh some more.
Bingo: "I want to do it!"
Bluey: "Okay, I'll help you."
Bluey goes over to Bingo to boost her up.
Bingo: "Almost!"
Bingo rings the doorbell, but falls on Bluey, stopping both from hiding before Bandit opens the door again.
Bandit: "Hello! Yah!"
Bluey and Bingo scream. Bandit chases them down the front steps.
Bandit: "It was you kids all along! Where's my 400 dollarydoos??"
Bandit chases Bluey off while Bingo runs to the side of the house.
Bluey: (off screen) "Run, Bingo!"
Bandit: (off screen) "Heel! Heel!"
Bingo trills as she runs by a mulberry bush, but stops when she sees something.
Bingo: "Huh?"
Bingo looks at the thing - a leaf insect on a branch.
Bingo: "Is that a leaf? Are you a leaf? You look like a leaf..."
The insect hops onto Bingo's nose.
Bingo: "...but you're walking! Are you a walking leaf? But... I don't understand. Why would a leaf want to walk? You should be in a tree, leaf. 
Bingo: (urgent whisper) "Daddy, come and see! Where are you going, walking leaf? Come here, Daddy, quickly!"
In front of the house, Bandit is swinging Bluey around by her feet as she laughs.
Bandit: "Give me back my dollarydoos!"
Back by the bush, Bingo still has the insect on her nose.
Bingo: (urgent whisper) "Daddy, come and see!"
The leaf insect flies off.
Bingo: (whispering) "Oh! Goodbye. Have fun... I'll miss you..."
Back in front of the house, Chilli is back from her run.
Bluey: "Mum!"
Chilli: "Where's my Bluey?"
Bandit holds Bluey back as she tries to run to Chilli.
Bandit: "Well, go on. Give your mum a hug. What are you waiting for?"
Chilli: "Oh, Dad."
Bandit releases Bluey.
Bandit: "Oh, sorry."
Chilli: "Where's your sister?"
Bluey points to Bingo, who is waving goodbye to the insect.
Bluey: "There she is."
A montage follows, showing lots of rainbow lorikeets sitting in a tree, Chilli removing prawn heads for dinner and talking while Bandit listens and Bluey and Bingo read the same book, Bluey in the bath washing Bandit's head while Bingo plays with a cup, Bluey and Bingo cleaning their teeth, and finally Bandit relaxing on the floor of the sunroom.
Bandit: "Ahhh..."
In the kids' bedroom, Chilli puts Bluey to bed.
Bluey: "Is there more weekend tomorrow?"
Chilli: "There sure is."
Bluey: "Hooray!"
Chilli: "Night, sweetie."
Chilli crosses to Bingo.
Chilli: "Already tucked in, Bingo, you little star?"
Bingo sniffs. Bluey hears this and sits up.
Chilli: (concerned): "Oh... what's up?"
In the sunroom, Bandit is still relaxing.
Bandit: "Ahhh..."
Chilli: (whispering from off screen) "Psst. Honey, come up here."
Bandit: "Yep, coming."
Back in the kids' room, Bluey is showing Bingo a doll to try and cheer her up.
Bluey: "Oh, and she's got sushi shoes, and there's rice at the bottom to help the shoes stand up."
The doll promptly falls over. Bandit enters and kneels down to Bingo's bedside. Chilli walks off to the door.
Bandit: "Hey, Bingo."
Bingo: "Daddy, you didn't come and see the walking leaf."
Bandit: "Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you."
Bingo: (voice cracks]) "That's okay."
Bandit: "The thing is, I don't know if you know this, but I bought this statue today, from a shop, and it turned out to be magic."
Bluey: "Yeah! Every time he would put it somewhere, it would just keep running away."
Bandit: "Yeah, and then I went to see the shopkeeper and tried to get my money back, but she kept running away."
Bluey: "And he chased me all around the yard. I kept running away."
Bluey laughs.
Bandit: "Yeah, and I didn't even get my 400 dollarydoos back. So I'm sorry."
Bingo: "Daddy?"
Bingo gestures for Bandit to come closer. He leans in.
Bandit: "Yeah?"
Bingo: "It was me!"
Bandit: "What?!"
Bingo: "I was the statue."
Bandit: "What?"
Bingo giggles.
Bandit: "You know what, I did think you looked a little bit familiar. "
Bingo giggles again.
Bingo: "Night."
Bandit: "Night, Bingo."
Bluey: "Night-night, Bingo!"
Bandit walks over to Chilli, who leaves. Bandit is about to leave as well, but Bingo stops him.
Bingo: (whispers) "Daddy?"
Bandit: "Yes, mate?"
Bingo holds her hands a small distance apart.
Bingo: "Just leaves the door open this much, so the leaf can come in."
Bandit: "No worries, kiddo."
Bandit exits, closing the door most of the way, revealing a pattern of glowing stars on the wall.
The credits music is the music heard when Bingo was with the leaf insect. Instead of Bluey dancing, the leaf insect hops into frame and walks around a bit.
