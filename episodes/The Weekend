Bingo: Yeah!
Bandit: How is that LBW?
Bluey: Dad!
Bandit : Coming!
Bluey: Dad!
Bandit : Yeah, I'm coming!
Bluey: DAAAD!!!!
Bandit: Okay, okay. Bonjour!
Bluey: Oh, hello. Would you like to buy a statue?
Bandit: Ah, yes. I definitely would like to buy a statue. I- wait a minute. These aren't magic statues are they?
Bluey: Oh, no. These aren't magic. These are just normal statues.
Bandit: Oh, good, cause I've been down that road before. Whoop, pause the game. Beep!
Bingo : Bilby's digging, bilby's digging, cockatoo, cockatoo...
Bluey: Jeejee Stinky! (Alternatively: Pleugh, it stinks!)
Bandit: Well, you're welcome to wait outside, kiddo.
Bandit: Boop! Unpause. Okay, I'd like that one please.
Bluey: 400 dollareedoos.
Bandit: Thank you.
Bluey: Enjoy your statue! Ha ha ha!
Bandit: Now, where am I gonna put this statue. Ah, yes, just here. Uh, I forgot my change.
Bluey: Hi!
Bandit: I think I forgot my change. 
Bluey: Oh yes sir, here you go.
Bandit: Thank you, shopkeeper. I'll just get back to my statue, which I'm sure is right over here. What? What's it doing over here? I could've sworn I left it over there. Oh well. I guess I'll just put it back. 
Bluey: Is everything okay?
Bandit: I think so. I could've sworn I left the statue over here, but I found it over there.
Bluey: Well, you're probably just going crazy or something.
Bandit: Oh yes, probably. Huh?
Bandit: What's going on here? Where's my statue?
Bandit: Hey, how did you get out here. There's definitely something weird going on. 
Bandit: What?! (growls) This IS a magic statue! I knew it! You sold me magic statues! You get back here! (growls)
Bandit: Where are you, you little reprobates? Oh, someone's at the door!
Bandit: Hello! Oh, what? That's strange… I thought someone rang the doorbell. Oh well, I'll just go back inside and carry on with my current tasks. 
Bandit: Hello. Huh? What? That's twice, now, and there's no one here! Certainly a very strange occurrence. 
Bingo: I want to do it!
Bluey: Okay, I'll help you. 
Bingo: Arf! Almost! 
Bandit: Hello! Yah! It was you kids all along, where's my 400 dollareedoos?
Bluey: Help Bingo!
Bingo: Huh? Is that a leaf? Are you a leaf? You look like a leaf? But you're walking! Are you a walking leaf? But… I don't understand? Why would a leaf want to walk? You should be in a tree, leaf. Daddy, come and see! Where are you going, walking leaf? Come here, Daddy, quickly!
Bandit: Give me back my dollareedoos!
Bingo: Daddy, come and see. Oh! Goodbye. Have fun. I'll miss you.
Bluey: Mum!
Chilli: There's my Bluey.
Bandit: Well go on, give your mom a hug, what are you waiting for?
Chilli: Oh, Dad. 
Bandit: Oh, sorry.
Chilli: Where's your sister?
Bluey: There she is.
Bluey: Is there more weekend tomorrow?
Chilli: There sure is.
Bluey: Hooray.
Chilli: Good night sweetie. Already tucked in, Bingo, you little star.
Chilli: Oh…. What's up?
Bandit: Ahh...
Chilli: Psst. honey come up here.
Bandit: Yep, coming. 
Bluey: Oh, and she's got sushi shoes, and there's rice at the bottom to help the shoes stand up.
Bandit: Hi, Bingo!
Bingo: Daddy, you didn't come and see the walking leaf.
Bandit: Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
Bingo: That's okay.
Bandit: The thing is, I don't know if you know this, but I bought this statue today, from a shop, and it turned out to be magic.
Bluey: Yeah! Every time he would put it somewhere, it would just keep running away.
Bandit: Yeah, and then I went to see the shopkeeper and tried to get my money back, but she kept running away.
'Bluey: And he chased me all around the yard. I kept running away. Ha ha ha!
Bandit: Yeah, and I didn't even get my 400 dollareedoos back! So, I'm sorry.
Bingo: Daddy?
Bandit: Yeah?
Bingo: It was me!
Bandit: What?!
Bingo: I was the statue.
Bandit: What? 
 
Bandit: You know what, I did think you looked a little bit familiar. 
Bingo: Night.
Bandit: Night, Bingo.
Bluey: Night-night Bingo!
Bingo: Daddy!
Bandit: Yes, mate?
Bingo: Just leaves the door open this much , so the leaf can come in.
Bandit: No worries, kiddo.
