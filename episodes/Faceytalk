(The episode opens with Chilli and Bandit doing their usual stuff in the kitchen, then Bluey and Bingo enter with the tablet.)
Bluey: Mum, can we do FaceyTalk with Muffin and Socks?
Chilli: Uhh...
Bingo: Please?
Chilli: Yeah, that's fine.
Bluey and Bingo: Uss!
Chilli: But no hogging that little Facey-Face thing, okay? Bluey, I'm talking to you.
Bluey: Yes, mum. No hogging.
Chilli: Cause you know what happens when you hog, don't you?
Bluey and Bingo: Yes, we know what happens when you hog.
Bluey: ...wait, do we?
(The call connects. Muffin is on the other end.)
Muffin: Hi!
Bluey and Bingo: Hi, Muffin!
(Socks pops in.)
Socks: Hi!
Muffin: Ah! Socks, stop hogging!
TITLE CARD: Faceytalk
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called "Faceytalk".
(We cut back to the Faceytalk. The kids start to draw as bouncy ambient music plays in the background.)
Bingo: Can I have a turn doing the drawing yet, Bluey?
Bluey: Um, yes, but can I just finish this?
Bingo: Sure!
Socks: Muffin, is it my turn?
Muffin: Not yet.
Socks: Muffin!
(Trixie pops in, waving at her nieces)
Trixie: Hi, girls!
Bluey and Bingo: Hi, Aunt Trixie!
Trixie: Muffles, make sure you give Socks a go drawing the silly stuff, okay?
Muffin: But I'm not finished!
Socks: Muffin!
(Socks tries to forcefully nuzzle Muffin off the tablet.)
Muffin: Socks, get off!
Socks: Ahh!
Trixie: Girls, I can't do this right now, I have somewhere I need to be.
(Muffin shrieks and bangs her feet on the floor.)
Stripe: Ugh! I can handle it.
Trixie: Uhh, are you sure?
Stripe: Yeah, I got it covered. Kids, you better share that thing or I'm switching it off!
Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, & Socks: What?!
Stripe: Woah! Ok, maybe not off. But…
Trixie: Look, I'll handle it.
Stripe: No, I can handle it! You do your thing.
Trixie: Well, okay... if you're sure.
(Trixie leaves as Stripe goes on his phone.)
Stripe: Right, I'm setting a timer on my phone, when it goes off, it's Socks' turn. Okay, Muffy?
Muffin: Buh.
Stripe: I'll take that as a yes.
(Later...)
Bluey: I'll just draw some clouds...
Bingo: Ooh... Nice clouds!
(The timer jingles.)
Stripe: Okay, Muffy, there’s the timer. It's Socks' turn now.
Socks: Yay!
Muffin: I have to finish my cowboy hat!
Socks: Oh...
Stripe: No, you don't have to finish your cowboy hat. You have to give Socks a turn.
Muffin: But I want to finish my cowboy hat.
Stripe: Muffy... Muffin Heeler! Give your sister a turn now!
Muffin: (loudly) But I want to draw a cowboy hat!
Bingo: Just give her a turn, Muffin!
Muffin: NO!
Stripe: Muffin Cupcake Heeler!
Muffin: Cowboy hat!
Stripe: If you say 'cowboy hat' one more time, you'll be in time out.
Muffin: Cow. Boy. Hat!
Stripe: Okay, that's it. You're going in time out!
(Muffin screams as she's taken away.)
Bluey: Oh, boy!
Bingo: Bye, Muffin.
Stripe: Come on! Muffin, stop wriggling!
(Socks moves the camera to herself.)
Stripe: Now you have a good think about it, young lady!
Muffin: (off-screen) No! I don't want to!
Stripe: (Pops head in) I'm sorry girls, but Muffin was hogging, so she can't do your Faceycall thing anymore.
Bluey and Bingo: Okay, Uncle Stripe!
Stripe: She needs to learn that other people have- What the?
(Muffin uses Stripe's phone to join in the call!)
Bluey and Bingo: Argh! Muffin!
Stripe: Gah! She's got my phone! Muffin, you get off my phone this instant! Argh!
Bluey: He's coming, Muffin!
Muffin: Argh!
(The chase begins.)
Stripe: Muffin! Running aw-(screen glitches) ay will only make it worse! Gah!
(Stripe trips on the Cat Squad bike in the hallway. Watching this, Muffin laughs.)
Stripe: Agh, my knees! Muffin, COME BACK!
Bluey: Muffin, you can’t steal your dad’s phone!
Muffin: Yes, I can! Now where do I hide?
Bingo: Under a bed!
Muffin: Okay!
Bluey: Don’t help her, Bingo!
Bingo: Why not?
Bluey: 'Cause she’s not meant to be running away, she’s meant to be in time out for hogging. 
(Muffin hides under her bed and starts drawing again.)
Bluey: Hey, that’s my ukulele!
Muffin: You lended it to me!
Bluey: Yeah, but that was ages ago!
Muffin: I’m still playing with it!
Stripe: (Pops head in on Socks' screen) Muffin, you hang that phone up now, young lady!
Muffin: No!
Stripe: Okay, well, I’m ending the whole FaceyTalk!
Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, & Socks: No!!!'
Stripe: Okay! Okay! Muffin, this is your last chance; you hang that up and march down here now!
(Muffin changes Stripe’s face to a gorilla on the FaceyTalk.)
Muffin: Gorilla man!
Bluey and Bingo: (laughing)
Stripe: What? What did you- Get this thing off me! That’s it! Where are you? (looking at Muffin's FaceyTalk screen) Oh, okay, you’re under a bed. Can’t see whose. Well, there are only so many beds in this house, kid. I’m comin'!
Bingo: Oh, no!
Bluey: He’s gonna find you, Muffin!
(Muffin exits her hiding place and is soon back on the run.)
Bingo: Just give him back his phone.
Muffin: No! Tell me if he’s out there.
(Muffin positions the camera in view of the hallway.)
Bluey: It’s clear, but, Muffin, I don’t think I should help you.
Muffin: What about now?
(Muffin positions the camera to show Stripe looking for her under a couch)
Bluey and Bingo: Ahh! Not clear! Not clear!
Stripe: Aha! Got you!
(Muffin screams loud enough, startling Stripe, Bluey, Bingo and Socks. This diversion allows her to run away.)
Bandit: (Walks in) Good gravy! What’s going on?
Bluey: Uncle Stripe is chasing Muffin!
Bandit: (laughs) Classic Stripe.
(Stripe is chasing Muffin down another hallway while she’s screaming.)
Stripe: Get back here, Muffin!
Bandit: Run, Muffin!
Bluey: Dad!
(Muffin runs into the bathroom... right as Trixie is in the toilet.)
Trixie: Ahh! Muffin!
Bluey and Bingo: (laugh)
Bandit: Whoa! Okay, there we go.
(Suddenly, chaos unfolds from Muffin's screen as the young girl wrestles with her parents for the phone, ultimately dropping it amidst the commotion. Muffin picks it up and draws again as her parents start to argue behind her. Their dialogue fades into the background.)
Trixie: What’s going on?!
Stripe: I’m handling it!
Trixie: It doesn’t look like you’re handling it!
Bandit: Uh, guys...?
Stripe: She escaped from time out!
Trixie: We don’t do time out anymore!
Stripe: What? Since when?
Trixie: I read a blog!
Stripe: You didn’t tell me!
Trixie: Cause you’re never here!
Bandit: Hey, uh, guys?
Trixie: Just let me handle it, Stripe.
Stripe: No, Trix, let me handle it. I get to parent too!
Trixie: Yeah, but…you have to do it right.
Stripe: This is how I do it.
Bandit: Guys? 
(Cut to the Heelers' kitchen. Stripe's dialogue here is inaudible.)
Bandit: Kids, can you switch this off?
Bluey: Ahh! But we’re doing drawing things!
Bandit: Alright, well, can you mute it?
Bluey: Yeah, we can.
(Cut to the screen view.)
Stripe: ...I feel like…you hog all the parenting.
Trixie: Oh…
Bandit: Is it this one?
(Bandit starts to switch the backgrounds on Muffin's view.)
Trixie: I don’t mean to.
Bluey: No, try this one.
Trixie: If you say one thing and I say another…
Bandit: Uh, no, that’s not it.
Trixie: …the kids get confused.
Bingo: Oh! I know!
(The FaceyTalk is muted.)
Bandit: You can turn the sound back on once Stripe and Trix have finished chatting. Okay?
Bluey and Bingo: Yes, dad.
(The scene shows Stripe and Trix talking (on mute) and later making up with a handshake and hugging each other. Afterward, Bluey unmutes.)
Bluey: Uh, Muffin... Better look behind you.
(Stripe and Trixie has appeared behind her.)
Muffin: Why?!
(She looks behind her and realises the situation! She screams and runs after again as the backgrounds continually change.)
Bingo: Stop running away, Muffin!
Bluey: Stop it!
Stripe: Muffin, I would urgently advise you to stop right NOW!!!!
Trixie: Listen to your father!
Stripe: Let's split up!
Trixie: Good idea!
(Trixie runs off to the sofa, meanwhile Stripe continues chasing Muffin)
Bluey: Ah! They're working together!
Stripe: Muffin, get back here now!
Muffin: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
(Muffin continues to run.)
Muffin: Where are they?
Bingo: Your mum's hiding behind the couch!
Muffin: What couch?!
Bingo: The couch!
Muffin: We've got lots of couches!
(Bluey and Bingo deadpan. The layout switches once again; full focus on Socks, with Bluey, Bingo and Muffin to the left.)
Bingo: It's that couch right there!
(Muffin runs to the couch... that Trixie is hiding behind.)
Trixie: Gotcha! Muffin!
(Suddenly, a calamity occurs; Muffin hops on Trixie's head; Muffin falls, Stripe trips over Trixie. Finally...)
Muffin: I'M FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!
Stripe and Trixie: Muffin!
(Muffin, trying to run away again, trips on a bone toy and flings the phone up in the air from the verandah.)
Stripe: NO! My phone!
(Muffin, Trixie, Stripe, Bluey, and Bingo - the latter two clasping each others' hands - watch as the phone flies up into the air... then into the pool.)
Bluey: Oh boy...
Muffin: Sowwy, dad.
Stripe: Muffin?
Muffin: Yes?
Stripe and Trixie: TIMEOUT.
Muffin: Okay.
(Defeated, Muffin walks to timeout. The call glitches and ends on Stripe's device, and Socks finishes her drawing.)
Socks: Finished!
Bluey: Oh, wow, that's great, Socks!
Socks: Thanks.
Bingo: Can I have a turn now, Bluey?
Bluey: Oh, yeah, sure.
(She scoots back for Bingo to take her turn.)
Bingo: Thanks.
Bluey: No problem, because we know what happens when you hog!
(Carmen Suite No. 1 plays in the end credits while flowers from the FaceyTalk are drawn in it.)
