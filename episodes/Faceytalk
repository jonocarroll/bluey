Bluey: Mum, can we do FaceyTalk with Muffin and Socks?
Chilli: Uhh...
Bingo: Please?
Chilli: Yeah, that's fine.
Bluey and Bingo: Uss!
Chilli: But no hogging that little Facey-Face thing, okay? Bluey, I'm talking to you.
Bluey: Yes, mum. No hogging.
Chilli: Cause you know what happens when you hog, don't you?
Bluey and Bingo: Yes, we know what happens when you hog.
Bluey: Wait, do we?
Muffin: Hi!
Bluey and Bingo: Hi, Muffin!
Socks: Hi!
Muffin: Ah! Socks, stop hogging!

Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called: Faceytalk.
(Title card ends)
Bingo: Can I have a turn doing the drawing yet, Bluey?
Bluey: Um, yes, but can I just finish this?
Bingo: Sure!
Socks: Muffin, is my turn?
Muffin: Not yet.
Socks: Muffin!
Trixie: Hi, girls!
Bluey and Bingo: Hi, Aunt Trixie!
Trixie: Muffles, make sure you give Socks a go drawing the silly stuff, okay?
Muffin: But I'm not finished!
Socks: Muffin!
Muffin: Socks, get off!
Socks: Ahh!
Trixie: Girls, I can't do this right now, I have somewhere I need to be.
Muffin: Ahh!
Stripe: Ugh! I can handle it.
Trixie: Uhh, are you sure?
Stripe: Yeah, I got it covered. Kids, you better share that thing or I'm switching it off!
Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, & Socks: What?!
Stripe: Woah! Ok, maybe not off. But…
Trixie: Look, I'll handle it.
Stripe: No, I can handle it! You do your thing.
Trixie: Well, okay... if you're sure.
Stripe: Right, I'm setting a timer on my phone, when it goes off, it's Socks' turn. Okay, Muffy?
Muffin: Buh!
Stripe: I'll take that as a yes.
Later...
Bluey: I'll just draw some clouds...
Bingo: Ooh... Nice clouds!
The timer jingles.
Stripe: Okay, Muffy, there’s the timer. Socks' turn now.
Socks: Yay!
Muffin: I have to finish my cowboy hat!
Socks: Oh..
Stripe: No, you don't have to finish your cowboy hat. You have to give Socks a turn.
Muffin: But I want to finish my cowboy hat.
Stripe: Muffy... Muffin Heeler! Give your sister a turn now!
Muffin(loudly): But I want to draw a cowboy hat!
Bingo: Just give her a turn, Muffin!
Muffin: No!
Stripe: Muffin Cupcake Heeler!
Muffin: Cowboy hat!
Stripe: If you say 'cowboy hat' one more time, you'll be in time out.
Muffin: Cow...boy... Hat!
Stripe: Okay, that's it. You're going in time out!
Muffin screams.
Bluey: Oh, boy!
Bingo: Bye, Muffin.
Stripe: Come on! Muffin, stop wriggling!
Socks moves the camera to herself.
Stripe: Now you have a good think about it, young lady!
Muffin: No! I don't want to!
Stripe: (Pops head in) I'm sorry girls, but Muffin was hogging, so she can't do your Faceycall thing anymore.
Bluey and bingo: Ok, Uncle Stripe!
Stripe: She needs to learn that other people have- What the?
Muffin uses Stripe's phone to join in the call!
Bluey and Bingo: Argh! Muffin!
Stripe: Gah! She's got my phone! Muffin, you get off my phone this instant! Argh!
Bluey: He's coming, Muffin!
Muffin: Argh!
The chase begins.
Stripe: Muffin! Running aw-(screen glitches) ay will only make it worse! Gah!
Stripe trips in bike in the hallway
Muffin: laughs 
Stripe: Agh, my knees! Muffin, Come back!
Bluey: Muffin, you can’t steal your dad’s phone!
Muffin: Yes, I can! Now where do I hide?
Bingo: Under a bed!
Muffin: Okay!
Bluey: Don’t help her, Bingo!
Bingo: Why not?
Bluey: Cause she’s not meant to be running away, she’s meant to be in time out for hogging. Hey, that’s my ukulele!
Muffin: You lended it to me!
Bluey: Yeah, but that was ages ago!
Muffin: I’m still playing with it!
Stripe: (Pops head in on Sock's screen) Muffin, you hang that phone up now, young lady!
Muffin: No!
Stripe: Okay, well, I’m ending the whole FaceyTalk!
Bluey, Bingo, Muffin, & Socks: No!
Stripe: Okay! Okay! Muffin, this is your last chance; you hang that up and march down here now!
Muffin changes Stripe’s face to a monkey on the FaceyTalk 
Muffin: says gibberish 
Bluey and Bingo: laugh
Stripe: What? What did you- Get this thing off me! That’s it! Where are you? Oh, okay, you’re under a bed. Can’t see whose. Well, there are only so many beds in this house, kid. I’m coming!
Bingo: Oh, no!
Bluey: He’s gonna find you, Muffin!
Bingo: Just give him back his phone.
Muffin: No! Tell me if he’s out there.
Muffin positions the camera in view of the hallway
Bluey: It’s clear, but, Muffin, I don’t think I should help you.
Muffin: What about now?
Muffin positions the camera to show Stripe looking for her under a couch
Bluey and Bingo: Ahh! Not clear! Not clear!
Stripe: Aha! Got you!
Muffin screams and it irritates Stripe, Bluey, Bingo and Socks while running away.
Bandit: (Walks in) Good gravy! What’s going on?
Bluey: Uncle Stripe is chasing Muffin!
Bandit: (laughs) Classic Stripe.
Stripe is chasing Muffin down a hallway while she’s screaming
Stripe: Get back here, Muffin!
Bandit: Run, Muffin!
Bluey: Dad!
Muffin runs into the bathroom right as Trixie is in the toilet
Trixie: Ahh! Muffin!
Bluey and Bingo: laugh
Bandit: Whoa! Okay, there we go.
Screen glitches
Trixie: What’s going on?!
Stripe: I’m handling it!
Trixie: It doesn’t look like you’re handling it!
Bandit: Uh, guys?
Stripe: She escaped from time out!
Trixie: We don’t do time out anymore!
Stripe: What? Since when?
Trixie: I read a blog!
Stripe: You didn’t tell me!
Trixie: Cause you’re never here!
Bandit: Hey, uh, guys?
Trixie: Just let me handle it, Stripe.
Stripe: No, Trix, let me handle it. I get to parent too!
Trixie: Yeah, but…you have to do it right.
Stripe: This is how I do it.
Bandit: Guys? Kids, can you switch this off?
Bluey: Ahh! But we’re doing drawing things!
Bandit: Alright, well, can you mute it?
Bluey: Yeah, we can.
Stripe: I feel like…you hog all the parenting.
Trixie: Oh…
Bandit: Is it this one?
Trixie: I don’t mean to.
Bluey: No, try this one.
Trixie: If you say one thing and I say another…
Bandit: Uh, no, that’s not it.
Trixie: …the kids get confused.
Bingo: Oh! I know!
The FaceyTalk is muted 
Bandit: You can turn the sound back on once Stripe and Trix have finished chatting. Okay?
Bluey and Bingo: Yes, dad.
The scene shows Stripe and Trix talking (on mute) and later making up with a handshake and hug eachother.
Bluey: Uh, Muffin.. Better look behind you.
Muffin: Why?!
The scene later shows both Trixie and Stripe chasing after a screaming Muffin
Bingo: Stop running away, Muffin!
Bluey: Stop it!
Stripe: Muffin, I would urgently advise you to stop right now!
Trixie: Listen to your father!
Stripe: Let's split up!
Trixie: Good idea!
Trixie runs off to the sofa, meanwhile Stripe continues chasing Muffin
Bluey: Ah! They're working together!
Stripe: Muffin, get back here now!
Muffin: No!
Muffin: Where are they?
Bingo: Your mum's hiding behind the couch!
Muffin: What couch?
Bingo: The couch!
Muffin: We've got lots of couches!
Bingo: It's that couch right there!
Muffin runs to the couch Trixie is hiding behind
Trixie: Got you! Muffin!
Muffin falls, Stripe trips over Trixie
Muffin: I'm free!!!
Stripe and Trixie: Muffin!
Muffin trips on a bone toy and flings the phone up in the air from the verandah.
Stripe: Ahh! My phone!
Muffin, Trixie, Stripe, Bluey, and Bingo watch as the phone falls and lands into the pool.
Bluey: Oh boy..
Muffin: Sorry, dad.
Stripe: Muffin?
Muffin: Yes?
Stripe and Trixie: Timeout.
Muffin: Okay.
Muffin walks to timeout, the call ends on Stripe's device, and Socks finishes her drawing.
Socks: Finish!
Bluey: Oh, wow, that's great, Socks!
Socks: Thanks.
Bingo: Can I have a turn now, Bluey?
Bluey: Oh, yeah, sure.
Bingo: Thanks.
Bluey: No problem, because we know what happens when you hog.
