We open on the Heeler household.At the veranda, Bluey and Chilli are wrapping up a Chutney Chimp gift, while Bingo is playing with red cellophane.
Bingo: Cellophane! Ooh, everything's red.
Bluey: I chose Chutney Chimp wrapping paper 'cause Chloe's birthday party is a Chutney Chimp party.
Chilli: Nice one. Present done, now go get ready!
Bluey, Bingo: Yay!
Bluey runs off, trailed by her sister, as...
Chilli: Oh, uh - Bingo, not you.
Bingo frowns.
Chilli: I'm sorry, honey, but you're not invited to Chloe's party, remember? Only Bluey is.
Bingo: You mean... I miss out?
Chilli: I'm afraid so, honey.
Enter Bluey from right.
Bluey: It's 'cause Chloe's turning seven, and she's only inviting seven people.
Bingo: Aww...
Cue a set of singing. In comes Bandit.
Chilli: You'll stay here with Dad, okay honey?
Bingo: Aww, okay...
Chilli: That's the girl. Dad, can you make us breakfast while we get ready?
Bandit: Si. Don't worry, Bingo, we'll make our own fun.
Bandit sings again as the others follow him out of the veranda. Now downcast, along with the music, Bingo leans sadly against the couch.
Bingo: Why is it always me that misses out?
Somber pause. Cue an off-screen bird squawk that brings a loose feather into the scene. Bingo curiously watches it fall to the ground...
Bingo: Ooh!
She goes under the table and picks it up, holding it like a wand. She then picks up the tape on the table and puts it on the ground, pointing the feather at it...
Bingo: Sticky-tape... heavy!
She then tries to pick it up; indeed it now weighs, like, a thousand tons. Bingo giggles, then realises what her dad meant earlier about making her own fun...
Bingo: Featherwand!
Title Card - A feather then falls down from the top of the screen and lands gently on the word "Featherwand".
Bingo: This episode of Bluey is called "Featherwand"!
Bandit scours the cupboard for Bluey's breakfast.
Bandit: Bluey, do you want cereal? ... Yeah you want cereal.
He exits, cereal in hand, into the kitchen, and as he walks in...
Bingo: Cereal, heavy!
Bandit: Huh?
Bingo: I said "cereal, heavy!"
The cereal box begins to weigh itself down, flinging the spoon Bandit was holding off his hand. Bandit struggles to pick up the box.
Bandit: What's going on?!
Cue further attempts to take the box off the ground.
Bandit: This is some... heavy... cereal! Must have a lot of... fibre!
Bingo giggles as Bandit lets go of the box.
Bandit: Oh, forget this...
He instead scoops the cereal with his hand into the bowl-
Bingo: Heavy.
Plop! Now the bowl is heavy too, throwing Bandit to the ground. For further effect, as she goes...
Bingo: Heavy.
As she leaves the scene. Now the spoon is heavy.
Bandit: What's going on...?
In the bathroom, Bluey sings a little ditty as Bingo silently enters the room and into the tub. Bluey notices the sound, letting out an audible "huh?", but doesn't notice-
Bingo: Heavy. 
-That her toothbrush is now cast with the "heavy spell"! Bluey, putting toothpaste into the sink and picking the toothbrush up, finds the toothbrush on the ground with a LOT of weight on it. Trying to pick it up, Bluey yelps...
Bluey: Uh, that's weird! Oof, it's heavy! Mum, do I definitely need to clean my teeth?!
Chilli: Yes!
Bluey shrugs.
Bluey: Oh well.
She instead brushes her teeth with the toothbrush on the floor.Meanwhile, in Bluey's room, Chilli is looking for something...
Chilli: Bluey, what did you do with the party invitation? I need the address!
Bingo slides the party invitation in from the verandah.
Bingo: Mup!
Chilli: Oh, there it is. I'll just pick it-
Bingo: Heavy!
Chilli: up...!
She then falls to the ground with the invitation in hand, an action that elicits a giggle off Bingo.
Chilli: What?
She gets up and tries to lift the invitation again, but fails to.
Chilli: Can't pick it up! Oh, well. I'll just have to write it on my hand...
She picks up a pen...
Bingo: Heavy!
And Chilli is now weighed down by the very heavy weight of the pen. She yelps.
Chilli: Huh?! Now this pen is heavy! Okay... Twenty... six... Nudgee.... Road!
Bingo giggles as she runs off again.
In the kitchen, Bandit, broom in hand, is struggling to pry the spoon off the ground.
Bandit: What's wrong Bandit? You used to be able to.. lift.. spoons!
Bluey enters the kitchen from the right of the screen, with toothpaste all over her mouth.
Bluey: What are you doin'?!
Bandit: Nothing! Eat your floor cereal! 
Bluey: Okay! 
She starts to eat the cereal loudly, like a dog, while Bandit is still struggling to get the spoon off the floor. Bluey pauses for a beat.
Bluey: This is the best morning ever! 
Chilli then enters the kitchen from the right with green drawing over her.
Chilli: Something weird is going on...
Bandit: Yeah, tell me about it-
Bingo, hiding behind the counter, appears in frame-
Bingo: Heavy!
-And Bandit then falls gracefully with a broom, pinning him down on the ground! Bluey stops eating her cereal, and looks at Bingo behind the counter.
Bluey: Aah! It's Bingo! She's got a featherwand!
Chilli: Get her!
Bingo, Chilli, and Bluey run out off screen and into the living room. Bandit is now completely pinned down; helpless, unable to move, trapped.
Bandit: Help!
Cuts to the living room. Giggling, Bingo is seen running up the stairs with the featherwand in hand, as Bluey and Chilli are seen chasing her.
Bluey: She's trying to stop us from going to Chloe's party!
Bluey and Chilli are seen going up the stairs. Meanwhile, the frame cuts to Bingo, who's laughing, rolling a yoga ball towards the stairs.
Bingo: HEAVYYYYYY!
Bingo then pushes the heavy yoga ball down the stairs. The frame cuts to Chilli and Bluey, having stopped halfway down the stairs while the yoga ball flies down from above!
Bluey: Aah!
Chilli: Look out!
Chilli and Bluey turn around and run down the stairs, screaming! The frame cuts to a living room view of Bluey and Chilli hiding behind a couch, while Bingo is at the top of the stairs.
Bingo: 
The frame then cuts back to the kitchen while Bandit still struggling to get the broom off of him.
Bandit: I didn't think it would end like this...
The frame zooms out to Chilli and Bluey standing right next to Bandit.
Chilli: We need a new plan!
Bluey: You and me, we get the present and head to the car.
Chilli: Yeah, while Bugalugs here distracts Bingo.
Bluey: Good plan! 
Bandit: Aah!
The frame cuts to the front patio of the house. In the centre of the frame, is the front door. The door swings open and out comes Bandit.
Bandit: Go, go, go!
Chilli and Bluey run out the door and towards the car yelling. Bluey has Chloe's present in hand.
Chilli: Don't look back!
Frame cuts to Bandit sitting in the middle of the door frame. Bingo then comes into frame from the right with the featherwand in hand, while laughing...
Bandit: Aah!
Frame cuts to Bingo's perspective. Bingo is running up to Bandit-
Bandit: Uhhh, you shall not pass?
-she then jumps into Bandit's arms.
Bandit: Oof. That was easy!
Bingo: Me. Heavy.
Bandit: Aah!
Bandit then falls to the ground. The frame cuts back to the front patio as Bingo slides over him while laughing. Bingo then goes down the patio stairs. The frame then cuts to Chilli and Bluey next to the car.
Bluey: Hurry, Mum!
Chilli: I'm hurrying!
Frame cuts back to Bingo running down the patio walkway.
Bingo: HEAVY!
Chilli: Ooh! Oh, no!
Bluey: 
Frame cuts to Pat walking down the footpath, while Chilli is still attempting to pick up her keys.
Pat: ♪ Walkin' down the footpath ♪
Bluey sprints over to Pat, tail wagging.
Bluey: Hey, Lucky's dad! You have to stop Bingo!
Pat: Oh, yeah, righto!
Frame cuts to Pat and Bingo running at each other yelling. Pat then gets into a Naruto pose, charging in with the bravador of a Labrador-
Bingo: Hat, heavy!
-oh.
Pat: Whoa!
Pat falls gracefully to the floor.
Pat: Oh, aah, aah!
Bingo: 
Pat: This hat's heavy!
Frame cuts to Bluey and Chilli trying to get the keys off the ground to unlock the car.
Bluey: Almost there!
Frame cuts to Bingo running toward the camera yelling with the featherwand in hand. Bandit is sprinting right behind Bingo. Bandit then picks up Bingo.
Bandit: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Bingo: Aah!
Frame cuts to the whole front yard, with Bingo trying her absolute BEST to heavy everything in her sight!
Bandit: Gotcha!
Bingo: Aah!
Frame cuts back to Bluey and Chilli. They finally get the car unlocked.
Chilli: We're in!
Frame cuts back to Bingo and Bandit. Bingo is trying to make Bandit heavy.
Bingo: HEAVY! HEAVYYYYY! HEAVY!
Bandit: Aah!
Bandit falls on his bottom.
Bandit: SHE'S GOT MY BUMCHEEK!
Bingo: 
Frame cuts to Chilli in the driver seat buckling her seat belt.
Chilli: Okay, let's go!
Bingo: Heavy!
Chilli: Bluey, come on!
Frame cuts to the outside of the car.
Bluey: Bingo heavied Chloe's present!
Chilli: Oh, NO.
Chilli unbuckles her seat belt and gets out of the car.
Chilli: That's it. We give up. You win, Bingo.
Bingo: Hooray! Unheavy, Unheavy. Off you go.
Bluey: Huh?
Chilli: What? You mean we can go?
Bingo: Yeah.
Chilli This isn't a trick?
Bandit: You don't mind missing out on the party?
Bingo: No. I made my own fun!
Pat: You sure did!
Chilli: Okay, let's go!
Bluey: Do we have to?
Chilli: Huh?
Bluey: I think I wanna stay.
Chilli: Don't you wanna go to Chloe's party?
Bluey: I do, but i just don't wanna miss out on playing featherwand either. 
Bandit and Chilli: 
Chilli: Well, this is a pickle..
Bandit: Yeah, Bingo. When you make your own fun, you certainly make your own fun!
Chilli: What are we gonna do?
Bingo walks up to Bluey as calm music plays in the background.
Bingo It's okay, Bluey. You won't miss out. When you get back, we can.. 
Bluey: Ooh, okay! Let's go, Mum! 
Chilli: Oh, oh, okay. 
Frame cuts to the roof of the house, then back down to Bandit and Bingo.
Bandit and Bingo: Bye!
'Bluey: See you soooon! 
Bandit: Uh, what did you whisper to Bluey? 
Bingo: You'll find out.
Pat: Hey, little help!
Frame cuts to Bingo building a thing out of blocks.
Bingo: ♪ There's a house with a wall, with a wall, with a wall, there's a house with a- ♪
Front door swings open with Chilli standing in the doorway with Bluey running toward Bingo with a party bag in her hand.
Bluey: Bingo, look! I got a party bag!
Bingo: Ooh! Is there one for me? 
Bluey; Oh, no. Sorry. You missed out.
Bingo: Oh. Uh, that's okay.
Chilli: Good girl, Bingo.
'Bluey: Can we play featherwand now?
Bingo: Yeah.
Bluey: Should we still...! 
Bingo: Yeah! 
Frame cuts to bathroom, where Bandit walks to the toilet.
Bandit: Just going to the toilet, boss!
Out of nowhere-
Bluey: Heavy!
-The toilet seat falls down from Bandit's fingers!
Bandit: Aah! Hey!
Bluey and Bingo: 
Bandit struggles to get the toilet lid to open, while Bluey and Bingo laugh in the background.
Bandit: I gotta go to the toilet! Come on!
Bluey and Bingo: 
Bandit: Aah! Gotta pee! 
Bandit comes flying through the front door.
Bandit: MAKE WAAAAAAAAAAY!
Bluey and Bingo: 
Bandit: 
Wendy: Bandit! What are you doing?!
Bluey and Bingo: 
Bandit: Aw, yeah. Morning, Wendy!
