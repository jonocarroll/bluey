The episode opens with an establishing shot of the Heelers' house in daytime. In the entryway, Chilli sits in the armchair while Bingo naps in her lap. Bluey is perched on the arm of the chair, working on a square of magenta crochet.
Chilli: "You're doing well! Okay, now, let's change colour."
Chilli hands Bluey a ball of purple yarn.
Bluey: "Changing color is tricky. I wish there was a rainbow-coloured yarn."
Chilli takes a string from the purple yarn and attaches it to the yarn that Bluey is using.
Chilli: "Oh, tell me about it. I'm on a quest for rainbow yarn!"
Bluey: "What's a quest?"
Chilli: "A quest is like a journey a hero goes on."
Bluey: "Oh. How does a quest start?"
Bluey starts working with the purple yarn.
Chilli: "Well usually the hero starts at home. They're nice and comfortable. But then adventure calls."
Bandit walks in, carrying a plastic container of curry in a plastic bag.
Bandit: "Alright! Who's coming with me to Mackenzie's house? "
Bluey: "No thanks, Dad. Mum's teaching me how to crochet!"
Bandit: "Well, just you and me Bingo."
He tickles Bingo's ribs, waking her up.
Bandit: "Come on, let's go!"
Bingo: "I am not interesting in that!"
She closes her eyes again.
Bluey: "Why are you going to Mackenzie's house?"
He pats the container of curry.
Bandit: "Curry swap."
Bluey: "What's curry swap?"
Bandit: "It's where you swap curry. I made a rogan josh and Mackenzie's Dad made a beef rendang. I swap a bit of mine for a bit of his, then we have two curries."
Bluey: "Oh."
Bandit: (singsong) "But I need Bingo to carry the peshwari naan!"
Bandit tugs on Bingo's foot. Bingo squeals and giggles, trying to hang on to Chilli.
Bluey: "Oh, Mum! It's a quest!"
Chilli: "Yeah, a curry quest!"
Bandit lets go of Bingo's foot suddenly.
Bingo: "Aah!"
The title card appears with the episode's title: Curry Quest. A ball of yarn is shown over the title.
Bingo: "This episode of Bluey is called: Curry Quest."
On the front porch, Bingo holds onto the door frame with both hands while Bandit pulls on her legs.
Bandit: "Eeeergh! Come on Bingo!"
Bingo: "Noooo!"
The scene cuts to Chilli and Bluey in the entryway. Bluey has completed a couple of lines of the purple yarn.
Bandit: (offscreen) "Eeergh!"
Chilli: "Usually the hero finds a reason not to go on the quest."
We cut back to the front porch. Bingo is still holding on to the door frame.
Bingo: "I want to stay with my mum!"
Bandit: "Eeeagh!"
Bandit stops pulling and lets her down. Bingo clutches the door frame.
Chilli: "But something always changes their mind."
Bandit puts his paws up.
Bandit: "Okay. Fine. Stay. But you know what Mackenzie's mum has? Face paints!"
Bingo looks up. The scene cuts to her running down the front steps onto the front path.
Bingo: "FACE PAINTS!"
Bandit leans out, holding a plastic bag of naan.
Bandit: "Hey, Bingo! Peshwari naan!"
She giggles and jogs back for the naan. We cut back to Chilli and Bluey.
Chilli: "And so the quest begins."
The scene cuts to Bingo and Bandit, walking down the footpath, having just descended a steep hill. Bandit is carrying the curry. Bingo has the naan balanced on her head. A willie wagtail perched on a fence post takes flight as they approach.
Bluey: "And what happens on the quest?"
Chilli: "Well the hero's out in the wide world, now. All sorts of challenges pop up."
Bandit and Bingo stop walking.
Bandit: "Hey, I didn't say you could use both legs."
Bingo: "What?"
Bandit: "You heard me. You only get to use one leg."
Bingo giggles and starts hopping on one leg.
Bingo: "I can't hop the whole way."
Bandit: "Toughen up kid. This is a curry swap."
Bingo: "Heehee, okay."
Bandit: "And who said you could walk forwards?"
Bingo stops.
Bingo: "What?!"
We cut to a bus stop, where Doreen is waiting for the bus. The bus stop sign has a poster on it, warning of magpie swooping season. Bandit enters as Bingo enters as well, still hopping.
Chilli: "Sometimes the hero meets friends along the way."
Bandit: "G'day Doreen."
Doreen: "Hi Bandit, Hi Bingo! Oh, something smells good."
Bingo holds up the naan.
Bingo: "It's the peshmari naan."
Bandit: "Doin' a curry swap."
Doreen: "Lucky you!"
Doreen: "You lookin' forward to tomorrow Bandit?"
Bandit quickly makes a gesture by waving his hand across his throat to get Doreen to change the subject. We cut back to Bluey and Chilli.
Chilli: "The friends often warns the hero of the danger ahead."
Bluey: "Danger?!"
We cut back to Bandit and Bingo with Doreen, still at the bus stop.
Doreen: "You're not going through the park, are you?"
Bandit: "Yeah, why?"
Doreen: "Oh, there's a magpie protecting his nest. He swooped me earlier, look!"
Doreen tilts her head and points at a hole in her hat.
Bingo: "Ooh."
Doreen: "The trick is, not to take your eyes off him. If he thinks you're looking at him he won't swoop."
Bingo: "Okay."
Doreen: "Ooh! My bus is here."
Doreen hops up as the bus arrives. The bus has a prominent advertisement for the Chunky Chimp movie.
Chilli: "There's always danger in a quest. Otherwise it's not a quest."
We cut to a close up of a swooping magpie sign. It pulls back to show Bandit and Bingo entering the park.
Bandit: "Oh. There he is."
The camera changes to show the view over Bandit's shoulder. A magpie stands on the edge of its nest in a tall tree, in the middle of an open field. A ball lies at the foot of the tree, and Winton approaches to retrieve it.
Bingo: "Why does he want to swoop us?"
The magpie swoops very close to Winton's head, causing him to run away screaming.
Bandit: "He's just trying to be a good dad."
We cut to a close-up of the magpie landing on his nest, and sitting on his eggs. He looks around, alert for more danger.
Bandit: "He thinks we're trying to hurt his eggs."
Bingo: "But we're not."
Bandit: "I know, but he doesn't know that. Just walk with me, and remember what Doreen said."
Bandit holds out his hand, and Bingo takes it.
Bingo: "Don't take your eyes off him."
They walk towards the tree, carefully maintaining eye contact with the magpie.
Bandit: "Keep looking. Keep looking."
They pass the tree, turning their heads to keep the magpie in view.
Bingo: "I can't turn my neck any further!"
Bandit: "Walk backwards."
Bandit walks backwards.
Bingo: "But I can't walk backwards, remember?"
Bingo takes a few steps backwards, and then falls on her bum.
Bingo: "Oof!"
Bandit stoops down to pick her up.
Bandit: "Come on. Come on!"
Both of them having broken eye contact, the magpie swoops at them. They run away but luckily make it to the edge of the park.
Bandit: "Phew, that was close."
Bingo: "Look Dad, we're here."
The camera pulls out to show they're at the edge of the Border-Collies' yard. Mackenzie's Dad is watering the lawn.
Mackenzie's Dad: "Curry swap! Whoo!"
We cut back to Bluey and Chilli.
Chilli: "After facing the grave danger..."
We cut back to Bandit and Bingo at the Border-Collies' house.
Chilli: "...the hero arrives at where they were going."
Bandit and Mackenzie's Dad swap containers of curry. They both hold the others' curry up and smell it appreciatively.
Bingo: "Here you go, the naan peshmami!"
Bingo presents the naan to Mackenzie's dad. He takes it with an eye wink.
Mackenzie's Dad: "Cheers Bingo!"
Mackenzie's Mum walks up, holding a brush and a container of face paint.
Mackenzie's Mum: "Would you like your face painted Bingo?"
Bingo: "Yes, please!"
A moment later, Bingo sits on a stool next to a table covered in face paint supplies. Mackenzie's mum takes a seat and loads the brush with orange paint.
Mackenzie's Mum: "I'm glad you're here Bingo. I'm on the face painting stall at the school fair so I need to practise. I'm not very good I'm afraid."
Mackenzie runs up, wearing some rather blotchy face paint.
Mackenzie: "Hi, Bingo!"
Bingo: "Aah!"
We cut back to Bluey and Chilli.
Bluey: "Is that the end of the quest?"
Chilli: "Not yet. Usually, here, some secret is revealed and the quest takes a turn."
We cut back to Bingo and Mackenzie.
Mackenzie: "Bingo! You get to go the airport tomorrow!"
Bingo: "Airport? I'm not going to the airport."
Mackenzie: "Yeah, you are! Your dad just told my dad he has to fly to work and he's gonna be gone for ages!"
Bingo: "What?!"
Mackenzie's Mum: "Mackenzie!"
Mackenzie flinches. On the Border-Collies' front porch, Bandit and Mackenzie's Dad are discussing curry.
Bandit: "So you wait until the end to put the curry leaves in."
Bingo walks up behind Bandit and pats his side to get his attention.
Bingo: "Dad, are you flying away to the airport tomorrow?"
Mackenzie's Dad slowly backs into the front door, excusing himself from this awkward conversation.
Bandit: "Oh... yeah. I am."
Bingo: "How long are you gone for?"
Bandit kneels down.
Bandit: "Just six weeks."
Bingo: "How long is six weeks?"
Bandit: "It's six... weekends?"
Bingo: "Aw, that's forever!"
We cut back to Bluey and Chilli. Bluey has completed a few more rows.
Chilli: "It's here that the true challenge of the quest is revealed."
We cut back to Bingo, sitting sadly on the curb. Bandit walks up and sits down next to her.
Bandit: "We have to head back now Bingo."
Bingo: "We can't. I don't want to go past the magpie. And I don't want you to leave."
Bandit: "I'm sorry mate. I don't want to go away, but I have to."
Chilli: "But just when things seem the saddest..."
Mackenzie's Mum: "Bingo! I've got the perfect face paint for you!"
A little bit later, Bingo sits on the stool, still looking sad. Mackenzie's Mum has painted Bingo's face orange, and is now painting some off-white around the eyes.
Mackenzie's Mum: "You want to know a secret Bingo?"
Mackenzie's Mum changes to yellow paint.
Bingo: "Yes."
Mackenzies Mum: "I'm thinking of not doing the face painting stall this weekend."
Bingo: "Why?"
Mackenzie's Mum: "Because I'm not very good at it am I? Mackenzie's meant to be a Cheetah!"
The camera shows Mackenzie, playing with a toy dump truck. He looks up, confused."
Mackenzie: "Am I?"
Bingo: "But then no-one will get to have their faces painted."
Mackenzie's Mum: "No, I guess not."
Mackenzie's Mum changes to black paint, and starts drawing stripes on Bingo's face.
Bingo: "Well, I think you have to do it."
Mackenzie's Mum: "Even though I don't want to?"
Bingo: "Yes, even though that."
Mackenzie's Mum: "Yeah, you're probably right."
Mackenzie's Mum holds up a hand mirror to show Bingo her face paint. Bingo now has makeup resembling a tiger.
Mackenzie's Mum: "What do you think?"
Bingo smiles, then gets into character, snarling and forming her hands into claws.
Bingo: Graaaaar!"
Mackenzie's Mum: "I think I'm getting better!"
Bandit: "See ya Border-Collies! Enjoy the curry!"
Mackenzie's Dad, Mackenzie's Mum, Mackenzie: "See ya!"
Mackenzie's Dad: "Good luck with the magpie!"
Bingo stops and thinks.
Chilli: "Now every good hero learns a thing or two on their quest."
Bingo runs up to Mackenzie's Mum.
Bingo: "Mackenzie's Mum, can you face paint one more thing?"
The scene cuts to the magpie, sitting on his nest. He spots Bandit and Bingo. They stand, determined, at the edge of the park.
Bandit: "Ready?"
Bandit holds out his hand to Bingo.
Bingo: Rawrr!
She takes his hand. As they walk towards the magpie, the music swells. They pass the nest, and turn their heads to keep the magpie in view.
Chilli: "Armed with everything they've learned along the way, the hero faces their ultimate test."
The magpie hops onto a branch and caws. Bandit and Bingo turn away - revealing that Mackenzie's Mum has painted smiling faces on the back of their heads. The magpie, who had just taken flight to swoop them, hurriedly flaps its wings and returns to the branch.
Chilli: "The End."
Bandit: "You're my hero, Bingo."
Bingo giggles.
The episode proceeds into a montage, with no words heard over the music which swells. That evening, Bingo and Bandit retell the story over dinner with dramatic hand gestures. We then cut to the airport. Bingo hugs Bandit goodbye. As he leaves with his luggage, saying "Bye all", waving to Bluey and Chilli, he points to Bingo and says "One foot", causing her to hurriedly stand on one foot. Cut to Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo having steak for dinner, followed by a cut to Chilli and Bingo walking through the park. Winton's ball is still at the base of the tree, now deflated. The magpie lands in its nest, carrying a worm, which it prepares to feed to their chicks.
At the school fair, Mackenzie's Mum paints a lizard on Buddy's face. Indy, Honey, and Winton wait in line. Buddy's Mum helps run the stand. Indy's mum runs a neighboring stand selling plants, while talking to Cornelius. Pretzel eats an ice cream, while Captain and Mia are having a conversation. Jack and Rusty run by in camouflage face paint. In the background, Bentley approaches the pony lady (with Buttermilk and Biscuits) to ask for a pony ride. As Mackenzie's mum applies face paint on Buddy, she smiles contently. We then cut to Bandit, appearing on a video call on a tablet. He waves to the camera, looking cheerful. Behind him is the village of Wae Rebo on Flores island, Indonesia. He has a brush tucked behind one ear, and is covered in dirt.
Bluey: "Why do heroes want to go on quests, anyway? They seem dangerous."
We cut to the reverse shot, showing Chilli sitting in the armchair, holding the tablet. Bingo sits on one arm, and waves to Bandit. Bluey sits on the other arm, and shows off her crochet project. We then cut to the airport. A jet lands in the background. We cut to arrivals, where many people are seen waiting for people. Cornelius can be seen jumping a bit to try and get someone's attention. Bingo waits right at the barrier until she spots Bandit.
Chilli: "Well they usually don't remember?"
Bingo's tail begins to wag. The camera pulls back, showing Bandit walk through the gate. Chilli and Bingo are beside her. Bluey wears her completed scarf.
Bluey: "Oh yeah."
Bingo runs under the barrier and runs to Bandit, embracing.
Chilli: "But that's what makes them heroes."
Chilli: "They go anyway."
The episode music continues into the credits. Chloe fades in - she has a sunflower painted on her face, with one of her spots forming the seed-head. Chloe fades away, replaced with Winnie. Her face has been painted with stripes of pink and white, making her look like a Neapolitan ice cream. Winnie fades away, replaced with Buddy. A lizard has been painted down his cheek, with its mouth overlapping his. Buddy fades away, replaced with Pom-pom. She has a Ulysses butterfly painted across her face, like a domino mask.
