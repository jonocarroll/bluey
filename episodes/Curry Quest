(Bluey and Chilli are sitting down, crocheting)
Chilli: Doing well! Okay, now, letâ€™s change color.
Bluey: Changing color is tricky. I wish there was a rainbow colored yarn.
Chilli: Oh, tell me about it. Iâ€™m on a quest for rainbow yarn!
Bluey: Whatâ€™s a quest?
Chilli: A quest is like a journey a hero goes on.
Bluey: Oh. How does a Quest start?
Chilli: Well usually the hero starts at home. Theyâ€™re nice and comfortable. But then adventure calls. 
(Bandit walks in)
Bandit: Alright! Whoâ€™s coming with me to Mackenzieâ€™s house? 
Bluey: No thanks dad. Mums teaching me how to crochet!
Bandit: Well just you and me Bingo. Come on letâ€™s go!
Bingo: I am not interested in that!
Bluey: Why are you going to Mackenzieâ€™s house?
Bandit: Curry swap.
Bluey: Whatâ€™s curry swap?
Bandit: Itâ€™s where you swap curry. I made a Rogan josh and Mackenzieâ€™s dad made a beef rendang. I swap a bit of mine for a bit of his, then we have two curries. 
Bluey: Oh.
Bandit: But I need Bingo to carry the peshwari naan!
(Bingo screams)
Bluey: Itâ€™s a quest!
Chilli: Yeah a curry quest!
(Title card plays)
Bandit: Eeeergh! Come on Bingo!
â€”â€”â€”â€”-
Chilli: Usually the hero finds a reason not to go on the quest.
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-
Bingo :(still holding onto door frame) I want to stay with my Mum!
Chilli: But something always changes their mind.
Bandit (letâ€™s go): Okay. Fine. Stay. But you know what Mackenzieâ€™s Mum hasâ€¦face paints!
(Bingo looks up)
(Bingo runs out)
Bingo: FACE PAINTS!
Bandit: Hey Bingo! Peshwari Naan!
(Bingo giggles and runs back)
â€”â€”â€”â€”
Chilli: And so the quest begins 
Bluey: And what happens on the quest?
Chilli: Well the heroâ€™s out in the wide world, now. All sorts of challenges pop up.
â€”â€”â€”â€”-
Bandit: Hey I didnâ€™t say you could use both legs.
Bingo: whatâ€”
Bandit: You heard me. You only get to use one leg.
Bingo: I canâ€™t hop the whole way.
Bandit: Toughen up kid. This is a Curry Swap.
Bingo: Heehee, okay.
(Bingo hops around on one foot)
Bandit: And who said you could walk forwards?
Bingo: What?!
â€”â€”-
Chilli: Sometimes the hero meets friends along the way.
â€”â€”â€”
Bandit: Gâ€™day Doreen.
Doreen: Hi Bandit, Hi Bingo! Something smells good.
(Bingo lifts up peshwari) Itâ€™s the peshwari naan!
Bandit: Doing a Curry Swap.
Doreen: Lucky you!
Doreen: You lookinâ€™ forward to tomorrow Bandit?
(Bandit cuts off subject)
______
Chilli: The friend often warns the hero of the danger ahead.
Bluey: Danger?
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
Doreen: Youâ€™re not going through the park are you?
Bandit: Yeah, why?
Doreen: Oh. Thereâ€™s a magpie protecting its nest. He swooped me earlier, look!
(Doreen shows them the tear in her hat from the magpie)
Bingo and Bandit: Ooh.
Doreen: The trick is not to take your eyes off him. If he thinks youâ€™re looking at him he wonâ€™t swoop.
Bingo: Okay!
Doreen: Oh. My bus is here!
Chilli: Thereâ€™s always danger in a quest.
(Bus pulls up) Otherwise itâ€™s not a quest.
Bandit: Oh. There he is.
(Magpie caws as Winton gets swooped)
Bingo: Why does he want to swoop us? 
Bandit: Heâ€™s just trying to be a good dad. He thinks weâ€™re trying to hurt his eggs.
Bingo: But weâ€™re not.
Bandit: Yeah but he doesnâ€™t know that. Just walk with me, and remember what Doreen said.
Bingo: Donâ€™t take your eyes off him.
(They approach the Magpie, making sure they keep an eye on him.)
Bandit: Keep looking. Keep looking.
(The Magpie stares at them)
Bingo: I canâ€™t turn my neck any further!
Bandit: Walk backwards.
Bingo: But I canâ€™t walk backwards remember!
(Bingo stumbles and falls, they both take their eyes off him)
Bandit: Come on. Come on. 
(They start running as the Magpie screeches and dives toward them)
(They avoid the Magpie, arriving at Mackenzieâ€™s house)
Bandit: Phew, that was close.
Bingo: Look dad weâ€™re here.
Mackenzieâ€™s Dad: Curry Swap! Whoo!
Chilli: After facing the grave danger, the hero arrives at where they were going. 
Bingo: Here you go, the naan peshwari!
Mackenzieâ€™s Dad: Cheers Bingo!
Mackenzieâ€™s Mum: Would you like your face painted Bingo?
Bingo: Yes, please!
Mackenzieâ€™s Mum: Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here Bingo. Iâ€™m on the face painting stall at the school fair and I need to practice. Iâ€™m not very good Iâ€™m afraid.
(Mackenzie runs in with a poorly done face paint)
Mackenzie: Hi Bingo!
Bingo: Aah!
Bluey: Is that the end of the quest?
Chilli: Not yet. Usually here some secret is revealed and the quest takes a turn.
Mackenzie: Bingo! You get to go the Airport tomorrow!
Bingo: Airport? Iâ€™m not going to the airport.
Mackenzie: Yeah, you are. Your dad just told my dad he has to fly to work and heâ€™ll be gone for ages!
Bingo: What?!
Mackenzieâ€™s Mum: Mackenzie!
(Bandit is talking to Mackenzieâ€™s Dad)
Bandit: So you wait until the end to put the curry leaves in.
Bingo: Dad, are you flying away to the airport tomorrow?
(Mackenzieâ€™s Dad slowly inches away to avoid the tight subject)
Bandit: Oh yeah. I am. 
Bingo: How long are you gone for?
Bandit: Just six weeks.
Bingo: How long is six weeks?
Bandit: Six weekends?
Bingo: Aw thatâ€™s forever!
Chilli: Itâ€™s here that the true challenge of the quest is revealed.
(Bingo is sitting on the sidewalk looking devastated)
Bandit: We have to head back now bingo.
(Bandit sits down with her)
Bingo: We canâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to go past the magpie. And I donâ€™t want you to leave.
Bandit: Iâ€™m sorry mate. I donâ€™t want to go but I have to.
Chilli: But just when things seem the saddestâ€¦
Mackenzieâ€™s Mum: Bingo! Iâ€™ve got the perfect face paint for you!
(Mackenzieâ€™s Mum is painting Bingoâ€™s face)
Mackenzieâ€™s Mum: You want to know a secret Bingo?
Bingo: Yes.
Mackenzies Mum: Iâ€™m thinking of not doing the face painting stall this weekend.
Bingo: Why?
Mackenzieâ€™s Mum: Because Iâ€™m not very good at it am I? Mackenzieâ€™s meant to be a Cheetah!
Mackenzie: Am I?
Bingo: But then no one will get to have their faces painted. 
Mackenzieâ€™s Mum: No I guess not.
Bingo: I think you have to do it.
Mackenzieâ€™s Mum: Even though I donâ€™t want to?
Bingo: Yes, even though that.
Mackenzieâ€™s Mum: Yeah youâ€™re probably right. What do you think? 
Bingo: (Growls)
Mackenzieâ€™s Mum: I think Iâ€™m getting better!
Bandit: See ya Border Collies! Enjoy the curry!
Mackenzieâ€™s Dad: Good luck with the magpie!
Chilli: Now every good hero learns a thing or two on their quest 
Bingo: Mackenzieâ€™s Mum can you face paint one more thing?
(They walk to the edge of the park ) 
Bandit: Ready?
Bingo: (Growls)
(They approach the magpie as the music playsðŸŽµ)
Chilli: Armed with everything theyâ€™ve learned along the way, the hero faces their ultimate test.
(The magpie hops onto a branch and caws.)
(Bandit and Bingo turn around to reveal a face painted onto the back of their heads, which causes the magpie to get startled.)
Chilli: The end
Bandit: Youâ€™re my hero Bingo
(The pair retells the story during dinner)
(They arrive at the airport the next day, as Bandit leaves, he reminds Bingo to only hop on one foot)
( The heelers eat dinner and walk past the tree with the magpie and his chicks) 
(Bingo, Chilli, and Bluey FaceTime Bandit who is covered in dirt) 
(At the school fair Mackenzieâ€™s Mum is doing face paints) 
Bluey: Why do heroes want to go on quests, anyway? They seem dangerous.
(The family arrives at the airport and Bingo is eagerly awaiting Banditâ€™s arrival) 
Chilli: Weâ€™ll they usually donâ€™t remember?
Bluey: Oh yeah. 
Chilli: But thatâ€™s what makes them heroes.
(Bandit comes out of the airport door) 
Chilli: They go anyway.
(Bingo runs to him as Bandit pulls her into a hug)
