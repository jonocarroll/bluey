The episode opens on a view of Bluey's bed from above. Bluey and Bingo are under the covers, and Bandit has rolled onto Bingo. Bluey and Bingo giggle, as Bandit rolls back to the middle.
Bluey: "Can we have a story, Dad?"
Bandit: "Okay. How about 'The Three Little Pigs?'"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah!"
Bingo shakes Bandit's arm.
Bingo: "Can you make it funny?"
Bandit: "Okay. One day, there were these three little pigs, called Jingo, Gruey, and uh... Jimmy or something. But Jimmy was on a team-building course for work, so we won't see him much."
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "So, the first pig, Jingo..."
Bandit nudges Bingo with his elbow.
Bandit: "...built her house out of straw. And one day, the Big Bad Wolf rocks up and says:"
Bandit pantomimes striding angrily.
Bandit: (as Wolf) "'Little pig, little pig, let me in!'"
Bandit: "But Jingo says:"
Bandit: (as Jingo) "'No way, mate, I'm making nachos.'"
Bandit folds his arms and looks away, dismissively. Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: "So the Wolf's like:"
Bandit: (as Wolf, politely) "'Oh, I just wanna talk to you about your electricity provider.'"
Bandit: "Jingo's like:"
Bandit: (as Jingo) "'Aw, that sounds good.'"
Bandit: "And she's about to open the door, and then she remembers:"
Bandit: (as Jingo) "'Hang on, I've got solar!'"
Bandit puts his hands on his hips.
Bandit: (as Jingo, sassily) "'Jog on, chief!'"
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: So the Big Bad Wolf huffed and puffed and blew the house in!"
Bingo taps Bandit on the shoulder.
Bingo: "Dad."
She whispers in Bandit's ear. Bandit repeats what she says.
Bandit: "So Jingo... called the police... and the police came!"
Bingo stops whispering, and Bandit resumes telling the story on his own.
Bandit: "And the little pig Jingo is cackin' herself and filming it all on a phone..."
Bandit pantomimes recording a video on a cell phone, then posting to social media.
Bandit: "...and posting it on the 'gram, and getting heaps of new followers, and the wolf's all like:"
Bandit puts his hands behind his back and struggles, pantomiming being handcuffed.
Bandit: (as Wolf) "'I didn't do nuffin'!'"
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "But the cops aren't buying that, and they're all like:"
Bandit: (as Cop, sternly) "'You got three priors, mate, and that Monaro's stolen, so tell it to the judge, buddy.'"
Bandit: "So they put the wolf in jail. Theeeeen, the other pig, Gruey..."
Bandit nudges Bluey with his elbow. She giggles.
Bandit: "... came and helped rebuild Jingo's house. But this time, she used Bessa blocks—"
Bluey grabs Bandit's shoulder.
Bluey: "Dad, wait."
Bandit: "Ah, yup."
Bluey whispers in his ear, and he starts repeating what she says.
Bandit: "And they build a rad pool shaped like an ice-cream cone, and filled it with lemonade."
Bluey stops whispering.
Bandit: "Wow, good idea!"
Bluey squeals happily.
Bandit: "Meanwhile, the Big Bad Wolf's got a softie judge, and was out of jail on good behaviour. The judge said:"
Bandit: (as Judge, sternly) "'You gotta go say 'sorry' to those pigs, or you're back in here, buddy!'"
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "So the wolf went 'round to Jingo's new joint, and Jingo and Gruy said:"
Bandit: (as Jingo and Gruey) "'Yeah, mate, it's all cool. Just don't try and eat us.'"
Bandit: "And the wolf's like:"
Bandit: (as Wolf) "'Yeah, fair enough. I'm going vegan anyway, I just eat tofu.'"
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "So they invited him in for a swim to try and make friends, but kept peeing in the pool!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Ewww!"
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: "So the pigs were like:"
Bandit: (as Jingo and Gruey, angrily) "'Stop peeing in our pool, mate! It's lemonade and we're trying to drink it! But really, even if it wasn't lemonade, you shouldn't do it anyway. It's full of nitrates and now we're gonna have to put heaps of algicide in.'"
Bandit: "Buuuut, but, the Big Bad Wolf kept sayin'"
Bandit: (as Wolf) "'Look, I didn't pee in the pool!'"
Bandit: "And the pigs are like:"
Bandit: (as Jingo and Gruey) "'Yeah, you did!'"
Bandit: "And he's like:"
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Bandit: (as Wolf) "'Nuh-uh, I don't do that sort of thing. It's against my religion.'"
Bandit: "So, the next day, they put this stuff in the pool that makes lemonade turn purple if you pee in it. They didn't tell this to the Big Bad Wolf, and he's there swimmin', and eatin' some cous-cous, talkin' about the Broncos, but then he goes all quiet and stares into space for a second with this sort've far-away look in his eyes, and the kids are like:"
Bandit nudges Bluey again.
Bandit: (as Jingo and Gruey) "'Here we go!'"
Bandit: "And suddenly the lemonade turns purple all around him, and the pigs are like:"
Bandit: (as Jingo and Gruey) "AAH! See?! You're a grub!"
Bluey and Bingo laugh.
Bandit: "So the Wolf is really embarassed, and he ran out crying, and they never saw him again. But apparently, he went on to become quite a successful tennis player. So, y'know, the system works. The End."
Bluey, Bingo: "Again!"
Bandit: "No."
