Script
(The episode opens with the view of Bluey's house. Three hot air balloons can be seen on the background. The scene cuts to the kid's bedroom. Bluey yawns as she wakes up and hops off the bed. She steps on an almost empty bag of balloons)
Bluey: Oh! Morning, balloons! (shakes bag to gets its contents out. There's only one balloon left.) I mean morning, last balloon. (blows up balloon)
(Scene cuts to the lounge/living room, Chilli has Bingo on her hands and over the couch.)
Chilli: You ready?
Bingo: Ready!
Chilli: Keep your arms up! (Bingo does so, and Chilli drops Bingo on the couch) Ah! 
Bingo: (giggles) Again! 
(Bluey walks in the room with her hand holding a fully blown balloon.)
Chilli: Morning, Bluey! Oh, what have you got there?
Bluey: This is my pet bird! (squeaks out some air out of the balloon)
Bingo: (giggles) He's saying "good morni-i-ing!"
Chilli" Oh, good morning, pet birdie. (waves at it)
Bluey: Go free, birdie!
(Bluey lets go of the untied balloon as it flies around the room wildly. Everyone laughs, although Chilli briefly ducks for cover. The deflated balloon eventually lands on Chilli's head. She looks a bit annoyed, but later calms down after seeing her daughters laugh.)
Chilli: Oh, that's funny, is it?
Bluey: (laughing) Yeah!
Bingo: (laughing) Yeah, it is!
Chilli: Well, I've got a game for you (proceeds on blowing the balloon)
Bluey: (excitedly) Is it "Keepy Uppy"?!
Chilli: Yeah, it's "Keepy Uppy".
Bluey: (does a small dance) It's "Keepy Uppy"! Whoo! (she does a short skip)
TITLE CARD: KEEPY UPPY (This is animated; a red balloon similar to Bluey's falls on the ground.)
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called, "Keepy Uppy"!
END TITLE CARD
(Both kids are in front of their mum, who is finishing tying up the balloon.)
Bingo: (curious) What's "Keepy Uppy?"
Bluey: You have to keep the balloon in the air and can't let it touch the ground. 
Bingo: (worriedly, as she holds Bluey) What happens if it touches the ground?
Chilli: Oh, nothing, Bingo. It's just a game. 
Bingo: Oh, okay.
Chilli: You ready?
Kids: Yeah!
(We get a view from below at the balloon as Chilli launches the balloon in the air)
Chilli: Okay... Go!
(Scene gradually returns to the overall view of the room as the game begins. The kids excitingly giggle.)
