The episode opens with a view of the Heeler home, three hot air balloons floating in the background. In the kids' bedroom, Bluey yawns as she wakes up and hops off the bed. She steps on an almost-empty bag of balloons.
Bluey: Ooh! Morning, balloons!
The final balloon falls out of the bag.
Bluey: I mean, morning, last balloon.
Bluey begins blowing up the balloon. In the living room, Chilli is holding Bingo over the couch.
Chilli: You ready?
Bingo: Ready!
Chilli: Keep your arms up!
Bingo does so, and Chilli drops her on the couch.
Chilli: Ah!
Bingo: (giggles) Again!
Bluey walks in, holding the now-inflated balloon.
Chilli: Morning, Bluey! Oh, what have you got there?
Bluey: This is my pet bird!
Bluey lets some air out of the balloon, making a squeaking sound. Bingo giggles.
Bingo: He's saying "Good morniiiiiing!"
Chilli: Oh, good morning, pet birdie.
Bluey: Go free, birdie!
Bluey lets go of the balloon, letting it fly wildly around the room. Everyone laughs, although Chilli briefly ducks for cover. When the air runs out, the deflated balloon lands on Chilli's head. She is a bit annoyed, but smiles seeing her daughters laughing.
Chilli: Oh, that's funny, is it?
Bluey: Yeah!
Bingo: Yeah, it is!
Chilli: Well, I've got a game for you.
She starts blowing up the balloon.
Bluey : Is it Keepy Uppy?!
Chilli: Yeah, it's Keepy Uppy.
Bluey does a little dance.
Bluey: It's Keepy Uppy! Woo!
TITLE CARD - a falling balloon and the episode title
Bluey : This episode of Bluey is called: Keepy Uppy.
Back in the lounge room, Bingo and Bluey are standing in front of Chilli, who is holding the fully inflated balloon.
Bingo: What's Keepy Uppy?
Bluey: You have to keep the balloon in the air and can't let it touch the ground.
Bingo worriedly holds Bluey.
Bingo: What happens if it touches the ground?
Chilli: Oh, nothing, Bingo. It's just a game.
Bingo: Oh, ok.
Chilli: You ready?
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah.
Chilli: Okay... go!
Chilli launches the balloon into the air and the game begins. The kids excitingly giggle and chase after it.
Bingo: Stop! Boot!
Bluey and Bingo keep giggling, "boot"ing the balloon to stop it from touching the ground.
Bluey: Boot!
Chilli runs over to the balloon.
Chilli: Boot!
Bluey: Aah, Bingo, quick!
Bingo chases the balloon across the living room.
Bingo: Yaa! Boot! (giggles)
Bluey: Boot! (giggles)
Bingo balks backwards into a pot plant to get the balloon.
Bingo: I got it, Bluey! Boot! Eee, get it!
Bluey: I got it, I got it!
Bingo: Bluey, get it!
Bluey: Yaah!
Bingo giggles. Chilli fixes up the pot plant as Bingo and Bluey continue playing.
Bluey: I got it!
Bingo: Oh, good.
Bluey: No, no, no, quick, quick!
Chilli "boot"s the balloon as it comes near her.
Chilli: Boot!
Bluey: Aah, Mum, you're making it harder!
Chilli: Ok, I'm going to cook brekkie, kids. Boot!
Bluey: Mum!
Chilli walks out, leaving Bluey and Bingo to continue playing and giggling.
Bluey: Look! What if we do small ones? Boot!
Bingo: Boot! This is so easy now.
Over in the kitchen, Chilli is making breakfast. Bluey and Bingo enter, still using small pushes to keep the balloon off the ground.
Bingo: Boot!
Bluey: Check it out, Mum! Boot!
Chilli: Hey, nice strategy, balloon girls!
Bingo: I'm a Keepy Uppy expert.
Bluey: Yep, but it's not as fun now. Can you make it hard again?
Chilli: Sorry, pickle, I've got my hands full.
Bandit enters the room with a basket full of washing.
Bandit : Oh good morning, everybody! Said good morning, everyone! Uh! Whaddup, party people?
Bluey: Dad, we're playing Keepy Uppy. Can you make it harder?
Bandit walks over to Bingo.
Bandit: Ah, my newspaper.
Bandit grabs Bingo and holds her upside-down like a newspaper, leaving Bluey to frantically skid all over the floor to get the balloon.
Bingo: Dad!
Bluey: Aah! Bingo, help!
Bingo: I can't! I'm a newspaper!
Bandit pretends to read the newspaper.
Bandit: Hmm, ah. Old so-and-so is at it again. Hmm, yes, yes...
Bluey gasps as the balloon flies out of her reach and over the counter, where it lands gently on top of a glass of orange juice.
Bluey: (gasps) Look! Wow.
Chilli turns around from the stove to see the balloon.
Chilli: Woah, look at that!
Bingo: Bluey, help!
Bluey: I'll save you, Bingo! Let her go!
Bluey tries to take Bingo out of Bandit's hands.
Bandit: Oh, you want to read the newspaper, Bluey? Ok, just don't do the sudoku.
Bandit lets Bluey have Bingo and walks over to the orange juice.
Bandit: Oh, look, lovely orange juice! Yes, please!
Bandit takes the juice, sending the balloon up and over towards the floor again. Bluey and Bingo scream.
Bluey: No, no, no! Boot!
Bingo : I'll get it!
Bluey: That's it, Bingo!
Bluey and Bingo run after the balloon, until Bandit grabs Bluey and embraces her Bluey screams and struggle, trying to get out of Bandit's grip.
Bandit: Oh, dear child. You grow up so fast.
Bluey: Ah, Dad, let go! Bingo, get it! Don't let it touch the ground!
Bingo is struggling all over the floor to stop the balloon from touching the ground.
Bingo: Bluey, help! I can't do it by myself!
Bandit: Dear child, embrace your father.
Bluey screams and pushes back against Bandit.
Bluey: Let go!
Bluey successfully gets out of Bandit's grip and starts helping Bingo.
Bluey: Boot!
Bingo: Aah, I'll get it!
Bandit : Oh, this heat is oppressive. I'll just turn on this fan...
Bandit activates a nearby pedestal fan, sending the balloon flying out of the kitchen. Bluey and Bingo scream.
Bluey and Bingo: Dad!
Over in the living room, Bluey and Bingo run in, chasing the balloon.
Bluey: Mine, mine!
Bandit: There's leaves everywhere!
Bandit is already there with a leaf blower. He blows the balloon out of the living room, Bluey and Bingo screaming as they run after it. In the playroom, Bluey and Bingo follow the balloon through lots of toys strewn around the room.
Bluey: There's too many toys on the ground! Boot!
Bingo: Who is responsible for this mess?
Bandit appears, lounging against the doorframe with a bowl of cereal and fruit.
Bandit: My, my, all these toys left lying around sure are making it difficult to keep the balloon up.
Bingo: We know!
Bandit: Can you imagine how easy this would be if you'd tidied them all away?
Bluey: That isn't helping!
Bingo: Oh no!
The balloon gently lands on top of a pile of blocks.
Bluey and Bingo: Ooh!
Bluey: Ha-ha, see, Dad? Our toys saved the balloon.
Bandit: Not for long!
Bandit turns on the ceiling fan, which blows the balloon off the block tower and towards the floor again.
Bluey and Bingo: No!
Bingo: You get it!
Bluey dives through the block pile to get the balloon, hitting it up.
Bluey: Yaa! (gasps)
Bluey: It's heading for the fan!
Bingo: Oh no!
The ceiling fan hits the balloon, sending it flying off. In the kitchen, Chilli is relaxing with a bowl of cereal and fruit - until she sees the balloon floating around outside.
Chilli: (gasps) Oh no!
Chilli runs off. Outside, she runs out after the balloon, Bluey and Bingo fast behind her.
Chilli: We can't let it touch the ground!
Bluey and Bingo: We know!
Bluey: Boot!
Chilli: No, I mean we really can't let it touch the ground. Balloons pop if they touch grass!
Bingo: What? You said nothing would happen!
Bluey: It's my last balloon!
Bingo: Catch it!
Bluey and bingo scream after the balloon. Bluey does a dive after it, hitting it up and over the fence to their neighbours'. Bluey and Chilli gasp, Bingo screams.
Bluey: It's going into Lucky's yard!
Over the fence, Lucky is kicking a rugby ball around. Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli poke their heads over the fence to see the balloon slowly falling towards the grass.
Bluey: Lucky, the balloon!
Chilli: Get it, Lucky!
Lucky: I'll get it! Boot!
Bluey: Aah! Lucky!
Lucky: I'm not going to make it!
Chilli: Oh no!
Bluey: No!
Pat enters the scene, running after the balloon with a mug of liquid.
Pat: Mine! Mine!
Pat hits the balloon up, grunting.
Pat: Yours, Lucky! Get onto it!
Lucky: Good one, Dad! I got it! I got it! (grunts)
Pat: That's it, boy! I got it! Mine!
Pat lunges after the ball, but collapses in pain.
Pat: Uh! (moans) Oh, I've done me hammy! You get it, Lucky.
Bluey: Lucky! Get it!
Lucky: Ok, Bluey!
Lucky runs past a groaning Pat and dives to hit the balloon back into Bluey's backyard.
Lucky: Yaa! There ya go, Bluey!
Bluey: Thanks, Lucky's dad!
Pat: No worries, Bluey.
Back in the Heeler backyard, Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli are running after the balloon again.
Chilli: We can catch it! I can catch it!
Bluey and Bingo: Catch it, Mum!
Suddenly, Bandit puts up an umbrella, hitting the balloon.
Bandit: Looks like rain!
Chilli gasps as the balloon floats down onto the grass. It lands, and pops. Bluey and Bingo scream, Chilli winces.
Bluey and Bingo: No!
Bingo runs over to the remains of the balloon, and sighs sadly.
Bluey: Oh, my balloon.
Bingo: It's popped.
Bandit: It's all good; we can blow up another one.
Bluey: But that was my last balloon.
Bandit : Oh. Did I make that a little too fun?
Bingo: Yes.
Bluey: Yeah, you did.
Bandit walks over and kneels next to his kids, putting an arm around Bingo.
Bandit: Sorry, squirts. It's a hard one to get right.
A moment of pause as they all stare at the popped balloon.
Bluey: It was pretty fun, though.
Bingo giggles.
Bingo: Yeah, it was definitely quite fun.
Cut to Lucky and Pat, looking over the fence.
Lucky: Yeah, it was really fun.
Back with the Heelers, Chilli kneels down next to the kids too.
Chilli: You know, I think we've got one last balloon left.
Bluey and Bingo: Really?
Bluey: For real life?
Chilli: Yeah, a big blue one.
Bandit anxiously gets up as Chilli looks at him.
Bandit: Uh-oh...
Cut to Bluey blowing on Bandit's tail, "inflating" him like a balloon. Bingo and Chilli stand nearby, watching and laughing as Bandit gets more inflated.
Bingo: Blow up the Daddy balloon! (giggles)
Chilli: Yeah! (laughs)
Soon, Bandit is fully inflated, Bluey holding onto his tail.
Bluey: Ready!
Chilli: Shall we play Keepy Uppy?
Bluey: Uh-uh!
Chilli : Oh...
Bandit: What? What?
Bluey: Go free, birdie!
Bluey releases Bandit's tail, letting him run around the whole yard, making raspberry sounds like a deflating balloon. Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli all laugh and giggle as Bandit flops all over the trampoline, before coming around and flying straight into them all.
Chilli: Oh no!
Bandit crashes into his family, grunting on impact. The Heelers lie in a pile, laughing.
The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a large band playing a fun groove - while the Heelers continue to laugh. Bluey is dancing.
