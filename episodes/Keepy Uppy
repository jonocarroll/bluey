The episode opens with a view of the Heeler home, three hot air balloons floating in the background. In the kids' bedroom, Bluey yawns as she wakes up and hops off the bed. She steps on an almost-empty bag of balloons.
Bluey: "Ooh! Morning, balloons!"
A single red balloon falls out of the bag.
Bluey: "I mean, morning, last balloon."
Bluey begins blowing up the balloon. In the living room, Chilli is holding Bingo over the couch.
Chilli: "You ready?"
Bingo: "Ready!"
Chilli: "Keep your arms up!"
Bingo raises her arms, and Chilli drops her on the couch.
Chilli: "Ah!"
Bingo giggles.
Bingo: "Again!"
Bluey walks in, holding the now-inflated balloon.
Chilli: "Morning, Bluey! Oh, what have you got there?"
Bluey: "This is my pet bird!"
Bluey lets some air out of the balloon, making a squeaking sound. Bingo giggles.
Bingo: "He's saying 'Good morniiiiiing!'"
Chilli: "Oh, good morning, pet birdie."
Bluey: "Go free, birdie!"
Bluey lets go of the balloon, letting it fly wildly around the room. Everyone laughs, although Chilli briefly ducks for cover. When the air runs out, the deflated balloon lands on Chilli's head. She is a bit annoyed, but smiles seeing her daughters laughing.
Chilli: "Oh, that's funny, is it?"
Bluey: "Yeah!"
Bingo: "Yeah, it is!"
Chilli: "Well, I've got a game for you."
She starts blowing up the balloon.
Bluey: (excitedly) "Is it Keepy Uppy?!"
Chilli: "Yeah, it's Keepy Uppy."
Bluey skips across the living room, excitedly.
Bluey: "It's Keepy Uppy! Woo!"
TITLE CARD - Keepy Uppy
The balloon that Chilli was blowing up falls from off-screen onto the title card.
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Keepy Uppy."
Back in the lounge room, Bingo and Bluey are standing in front of Chilli. Chilli ties a knot in the neck of the balloon.
Bingo: "What's Keepy Uppy?"
Bluey: "You have to keep the balloon in the air and can't let it touch the ground."
Bingo worriedly holds Bluey.
Bingo: "What happens if it touches the ground?"
Chilli: "Oh, nothing, Bingo. It's just a game."
Bingo: "Oh, okay."
Chilli: "You ready?"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah."
Chilli: "Okay... go!"
Chilli launches the balloon into the air and the game begins. The kids excitingly giggle and chase after it, making 'bwut!' sounds as they bat the balloon back into the air.
Bingo: "Yaah! Bwut!"
Bluey and Bingo keep giggling."
Bluey: "Bwut!"
Bluey knocks the ballon across the room. Bluey and Bingo run over to get it, but Chilli gets it first.
Chilli: "Bwut!"
Bluey: "Aah, Bingo, quick!"
Bingo chases the balloon across the living room.
Bingo: "Yaa! Bwut!"
She dives and knocks up the balloon. She lays on the floor, giggling. Bluey climbs on the couch.
Bluey: "Bwut!"
She jumps and knocks the balloon away. She lands sitting on the couch, giggling. Bingo walks backwards, bumping into a pot plant. A little dirt ends up on the floor.
Bingo: "I got it, Bluey! Bwut! Eee, get it!"
Bluey: "I got it, I got it!"
Bingo: "Bluey, get it!"
Bluey: "Whooo!"
Bluey climbs on a chair, hitting the balloon. In the background, Chilli scrapes up the dirt and puts it back in the pot.
Bingo giggles. Chilli fixes up the pot plant as Bingo and Bluey continue playing.
Bluey: "I got it!"
Bingo: "Oh, good."
Bluey: "No, no, no, quick, quick!"
The balloon drifts over to Chilli, who bats it away.
Chilli: "Bwut!"
Bluey: "Aah, Mum, you're making it harder!"
Chilli: "Okay, I'm gonna cook brekkie, kids."
Chilli walks towards the kitchen. She bats the balloon on the way.
Chilli: "Bwut!"
Bluey: "Mum!"
Chilli walks out, leaving Bluey and Bingo to continue playing and giggling.
Bluey: "Look! What if we do small ones? Bwut!"
They get close together, gently tapping the balloon.
Bingo: "Bwut! This is so easy now."
Over in the kitchen, Chilli is making breakfast. Bluey and Bingo enter, still using small pushes to keep the balloon off the ground.
Bingo: "Bwut!"
Bluey: "Check it out, Mum! Bwut!"
Chilli: "Hey, nice strategy, balloon girls!"
Bingo: "I'm a Keepy Uppy expert."
Bluey: "Yep, but it's not as fun now. Can you make it hard again?"
Chilli: "Sorry, pickle, I've got my hands full."
Bandit enters the room, dancing with a basket of folded laundry.
Bandit: ♫ "Oh good morning, everybody! Said good morning, everyone! Uh!" ♫ 
Bandit: "Whaddup, party people?"
Bluey: "Dad, we're playing Keepy Uppy. Can you make it harder?"
Bandit walks over to Bingo.
Bandit: "Ah, my newspaper."
Bandit grabs Bingo and holds her upside-down and pretends to read her like a newspaper. Bluey skids back and forth across the kitchen floor, trying to keep the balloon aloft by herself.
Bingo: "Dad!"
Bluey: "Aah! Bingo, help!"
Bingo: "I can't! I'm a newspaper!"
Bandit pretends to read the newspaper.
Bandit: "Hmm, ah. Old so-and-so is at it again. Hmm, yes, yes..."
Bluey gasps as the balloon flies out of her reach and over the counter, where it lands gently on top of a glass of orange juice.
Bluey: (gasps) "Look! Wow."
Chilli turns around from the stove to see the balloon.
Chilli: "Woah, look at that!"
Bingo: "Bluey, help!"
Bluey: "I'll save you, Bingo! Let her go!"
Bluey grabs Bingo's hands and tries to pull her out of Bandit's grasp.
Bandit: "Oh, you want to read the newspaper, Bluey? Okay, just don't do the suduku."
Bandit lets Bluey have Bingo and walks over to the counter.
Bandit: "Oh, look, lovely orange juice! Yes, please!"
Bandit takes the juice, sending the balloon up and over towards the floor again. Bluey and Bingo scream.
Bluey: "No, no, no! Bwut!"
Bluey dives to hit the balloon.
Bingo: (panting) "I'll get it!"
Bluey: "That's it, Bingo!"
Bluey and Bingo run after the balloon, until Bandit grabs Bluey and embraces her. Bluey screams and squirms, trying to get out of Bandit's grip.
Bandit: "Oh, dear child. You grow up so fast."
Bluey: "Ah, Dad, let go! Bingo, get it! Don't let it touch the ground!"
Bingo is struggling all over the floor to stop the balloon from touching the ground.
Bingo: "Bluey, help! I can't do it by myself!"
Bandit: "Dear child, embrace your father."
Bluey screams and pushes back against Bandit.
Bluey: "Let go!"
Bluey successfully gets out of Bandit's grip and starts helping Bingo.
Bluey: "Bwut!"
Bingo: "Aah, I'll get it!"
Bandit: (dramatically) "Oh, this heat is oppressive. I'll just turn on this fan..."
Bandit activates a nearby pedestal fan, sending the balloon flying out of the kitchen. Bluey and Bingo scream.
Bluey, Bingo: "Dad!"
Over in the living room, Bluey and Bingo run in, chasing the balloon.
Bluey: "Mine, mine!"
Bandit: "There's leaves everywhere!"
Bandit is already there with a leaf blower. He blows the balloon out of the living room, Bluey and Bingo screaming as they run after it. In the playroom, Bluey and Bingo follow the balloon through lots of toys strewn around the room.
Bluey: "There's too many toys on the ground! Bwut!"
Bluey and Bingo keep going after the balloon, tiptoeing and moving carefully around all the blocks on the floor.
Bingo: "Who is responsible for this mess?"
Bandit appears, lounging against the doorframe with a bowl of cereal and fruit.
Bandit: "My, my, all these toys left lying around sure are making it difficult to keep the balloon up."
Bingo: "We know!"
Bandit: "Can you imagine how easy this would be if you'd tidied them all away?"
Bluey hits the balloon, but falls on her bum in the process.
Bluey: "That isn't helping!"
Bingo: "Oh no!"
The balloon gently lands on top of a pile of blocks.
Bluey, Bingo: "Ooh!"
Bluey: "Ha-ha, see, Dad? Our toys saved the balloon."
Bandit: "Not for long!"
Bandit turns on the ceiling fan, which blows the balloon off the block tower and towards the floor again.
Bluey, Bingo: "No!"
Bingo: "You get it!"
Bluey dives through the block pile to get the balloon, hitting the balloon up while collapsing the block tower.
Bluey: "Yaa!"
Bluey: "It's heading for the fan!"
Bingo: "Oh no!"
The ceiling fan hits the balloon, sending it flying off. In the kitchen, Chilli is relaxing with a bowl of cereal and fruit - until she sees the balloon floating around outside. She gasps.
Chilli: "Oh no!"
Chilli runs off, leaving her cereal behind. Outside, she runs out after the balloon, Bluey and Bingo fast behind her.
Chilli: "We can't let it touch the ground!"
Chilli dives, saving the balloon.
Bluey, Bingo: "We know!"
Bluey: "Bwut!"
Chilli: "No, I mean we really can't let it touch the ground. Balloons pop if they touch grass!"
Bingo: "What? You said nothing would happen!"
Bluey: "It's my last balloon!"
Bingo: "Catch it!"
Bluey and Bingo scream and run after the balloon. Bluey dives to catch it, hitting it up and over the rear fence. Bluey and Chilli gasp, Bingo screams.
Bluey: "It's going into Lucky's yard!"
Over the fence, Lucky is kicking a rugby ball around. Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli poke their heads over the fence to see the balloon slowly falling towards the grass. Lucky looks over to see the Heelers poking their heads over the fence.
Bluey: "Lucky, the balloon!"
Lucky looks back and grins as he spots the red balloon slowly descending towards the grass.
Chilli: "Get it, Lucky!"
Lucky: "I'll get it! Bwut!"
Lucky runs after the balloon and manages to kick it up in the air.
Bluey: "Aah! Lucky!"
Lucky runs the opposite direction of the balloon for a second before stopping.
Lucky: "I'm not going to make it!"
He gets up to try and chase the balloon down, but he ends up stumbling and falling.
Chilli: "Oh no!"
Bluey: "No!"
A yellow Labrador man holding a coffee mug runs in.
Pat: "Mine! Mine!"
Pat hits the balloon up, grunting and spilling some coffee.
Pat: "Yours, Lucky! Get onto it!"
Lucky gives his dad a thumbs up while wagging his tail.
Lucky: "Good one, Dad! I got it! I got it!
Lucky runs backwards, then bumps the balloon up with a grunt.
Pat: "That's it, boy! I got it! Mine!"
Pat lunges and hits the ball, but then clutches his thigh and collapses, losing the rest of his coffee.
Pat: "Uh! Oh, I've done me hammy! You get it, Lucky."
Bluey: "Lucky! Get it!"
Lucky: "Okay, Bluey!"
Lucky runs past a groaning Pat and dives to hit the balloon back into Bluey's backyard.
Lucky: "Yaa! There ya go, Bluey!"
Bluey: "Thanks, Lucky's dad!"
Pat: "No worries, Bluey."
Back in the Heeler backyard, Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli are running after the balloon again.
Chilli: "We can catch it! I can catch it!"
Bluey, Bingo: "Catch it, Mum!"
Suddenly, Bandit puts up an umbrella, hitting the balloon.
Bandit: "Looks like rain!"
Chilli gasps as the balloon floats down onto the grass. It lands, and pops. Bluey and Bingo scream, Chilli winces at the kids' screaming."
Bluey, Bingo: "No!"
Bingo runs over to the remains of the balloon, and sighs sadly.
Bluey: "Oh, my balloon."
Bingo: "It's popped."
Bandit: "It's all good; we can blow up another one."
Bluey: "But that was my last balloon."
Bandit: "Oh. Did I make that a little too fun?"
Bingo: "Yes."
Bluey: "Yeah, you did."
Bandit walks over and kneels next to his kids, putting an arm around Bingo.
Bandit: "Sorry, squirts. It's a hard one to get right."
A moment of pause as they all stare at the popped balloon.
Bluey: "It was pretty fun, though."
Bingo giggles.
Bingo: "Yeah, it was definitely quite fun."
Cut to Lucky and Pat, looking over the fence.
Lucky: "Yeah, it was really fun."
Back with the Heelers, Chilli kneels down next to the kids too.
Chilli: "You know, I think we've got one last balloon left."
Bluey, Bingo: "Really?"
Bluey: "For real life?"
Chilli: "Yeah, a big blue one."
Bandit anxiously backs up a few steps as Chilli looks at him.
Bandit: "Uh-oh..."
Cut to Bluey blowing on Bandit's tail. He stands up and gradually raises his arms, as though he is being inflated. Bingo and Chilli stand nearby, watching and laughing as Bandit gets more inflated.
Bingo: "Blow up the Daddy balloon!"
Chilli: "Yeah!"
Soon, Bandit is fully inflated, with Bluey holding onto his tail.
Bluey: "Ready!"
Chilli: "Shall we play Keepy Uppy?"
Bluey: "Uh-uh!"
Chilli: (knowingly) "Oh..."
Bandit: "What? What?"
Bluey: "Go free, birdie!"
Bluey releases Bandit's tail, letting him run around the whole yard, making raspberry sounds like a deflating balloon. Bluey, Bingo, and Chilli all laugh and giggle as Bandit flops all over the trampoline, before coming around and running straight at the camera. Cut to a reverse shot of Chilli, Bluey, and Bingo. Bluey and Bingo scream.'
Chilli: "Oh no!"
They brace for impact. The shot cuts away to a magpie, which winces and covers its face with a wing. The camera pans down to the family lying in a pile, laughing.
The credits music is the episode's soundtrack - a large band playing a fun groove - while the Heelers continue to laugh. Bluey is dancing.
Chilli: "Yeah, ya big lump."
