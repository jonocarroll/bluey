(This episode starts outside with Chilli doing a stretching pose, with hands and feet on the ground, and Bandit fixing the car. The kids wait for him beside their mum as the latter plays a game with them.)
Chilli	: Ah, what a nice sunny day.
Bluey, Bingo	: Ah, nice and sunny!
Chilli	: Uh-oh, problem. It's raining!
Bluey, Bingo	: (panicking) Arggh!!!
Chilli	: Quick, get under the mumbrella.
Bluey & Bingo	: Arggh!!! (run below their mum)
Chilli	: Phew, nice and dry. Oh, no, the mumbrella's blowing away! (moves away from the kids)
(Kids giggle as they run back under the "mumbrella")
Chilli	: Phew. Nice and dry...! (moves away again)
(Kids squeal as they once again try to run back under their mum)
Bandit	: (finished fixing the car) Alright. Bluey, let's go.
Bluey	: (runs into the car and gets in) See ya, Mum. See ya, Bingo.
Chilli & Bingo	: See ya. Have fun.
Bingo	: Can you play with me until Bluey gets back from Chloe's house?
Chilli	: I can't, honey. There's a problem with the toilet. It won't flush. Mum has to fix it.
Bingo	: But who am I going to play with?
Chilli	: You're gonna play with Bingo.
Bingo	: Oh, yeah!
(TITLE CARD	: This episode of Bingo is called "Bingo".)
The title card is animated: It shows Bingo looking at us and audibly giggles.
Chilli	: Okay, Mum's gotta get to it. You go play by yourself. (begins fixing the toilet)
Bingo	: Okay! (begins running off, then stops) Oh, one problem.
Chilli	: Oh, yeah, what's that?
Bingo	: I don't know how to play by myself.
Chilli	: Yeah, you do, sweetie. You're just not used to it. Give it a go.
Bingo	: Okay, Mama.
(Bingo runs off and enters the playroom, doing a small dance)
Bingo	: Doo, doo, dee-doo, dee-doo... What am I gonna do-? (sees a small area in the playroom where she usually plays doctor) Oh, I'll play doctor!
(Scene cuts to the same area, now a doctor's office, with Bingo wearing a stethoscope)
Bingo	: Next patient!
(Scene cuts to the rest of the room, with set up chairs and no patient)
Bingo	: Oh, yeah, this won't work.
(Scene cuts to the central rug, Bingo skips in)
Bingo	: Dee-doo, doo, doo... (thinks of another game) Hmm... Ooh, I know! I spy with my little eye, something coloured... green. (realizes) Oh, wait, this won't work either. (appears to look at us) It was rug, by the way.
(Scene cuts to the balcony)
Bingo	: (skips in) Dee-doo, doo, dee-doo... Hmm, maybe I can play a railings game.
(Meanwhile at the toilet)
Chilli	: (working with a few parts in the toilet cistern) What if I lift you up a bit?
Bingo	: Mum, problem!
(Chilli goes to see Bingo. She has her foot stuck on a railing.)
Bingo	: It happened again.
Chilli	: Oh, Bingo, I told you. Don't put your legs in the railing.
Bingo	: Sorry, Mama.
Chilli	: Turn it. (Bingo moves her foot a bit and has it freed with help of her mum) Yep, there you go.
Bingo	: I'm having a problem getting started.
Chilli	: Maybe you're just hungry. 
Bingo : Oh, yeah!
(Scene cuts to interior of fridge, where we see Bingo opening it)
Bingo	: Ooh, raspberries and blueberries. Which one do I want? Raspberries or blueberries? Hmm...
(FRIDGE BEEPS)
Bingo	: Hey. Do you mind, fridge? I'm trying to decide. Now, raspberries or...
(FRIDGE BEEPS)
Bingo	: Hey! So rude! Maybe if I open then shut you. Shut. (closes fridge door) Open. (opens door) OK, now...
(FRIDGE BEEPS)
Bingo	: (annoyed) Oh, that's it, fridge. I'm leaving! (closes door, after a while returns to open it) Oh, but I'm really hungry. Okay, I'm just gonna close my eyes and choose. (does so as she moves her hand around. When she opens her eyes, her hand lands on...) Blueberries! (picks up box of blueberries)
(FRIDGE BEEPS)
Bingo	: Okay, Okay! (closes fridge door)
Scene cuts to the balcony. Bingo sits on its bench holding a blueberry. There is also a single blueberry on the plate on its table.
Bingo	: (talking to blueberry) I'm going to eat you. (chomps down blueberry) Alright, I'm not hungry anymore. (thinks) Now, what's a game that only needs Bingo? Ooh, I know. (giggles as she runs off)
(At the toilet)
Chilli	: (frantically presses flush button) Why won't you flush?!
(DOOR CLOSES)
Chilli	: Bingo?
Bingo	: Yes?
Chilli	: Are you OK?
Bingo	: Yes!
Chilli	: What are you doing?
Bingo	: I'm hiding!
Chilli	: Oh, Okay. (presses button again, then realizes something)
Chilli	: Why are you hiding?
Bingo	: I'm playing hide and seek.
Chilli	: Right... Who's coming to find you?
(beat)
Bingo	: (realizing) Oh!
(Chilli lightly shakes her head and goes to find her daughter. She finds Bingo sitting in the playroom closet. Bingo sees her and moves closer as her mum gets a bit lower to hug her.)
Bingo	: I just miss my sister.
Chilli	: I know.
Bingo	: And the fridge doesn't like me.
Chilli	: I... know? (confused)
Scene returns to toilet. Bingo walks behind her mum as she goes back to fixing it.
Bingo	: Are you sure you can't play with me just a little bit?
Chilli	: No, honey, I have to fix the toilet.
Bingo	: But that's not fun.
Chilli	: It's fun for me. I like a good problem.
Bingo	: Maybe I need a good problem.
Chilli	: Ahh, that's it, Bingo! You don't need a game. You need a problem.
Bingo	: Ooh!
Bandit	: I'm back.
(Bandit walks in. He steps on a broken tile.)
Chilli	: Dad, do you have a good problem for Bingo?
Bandit	: Well, yeah, I do, actually.
Bingo	: Ooh, what is it?
Bandit	: Well, on the way to Chloe's, Bluey wanted to know what colour Kiwis were.
Bingo	: The fruit? They're green.
Bandit	: No, the little furry animal that lives in New Zealand.
Chilli	: Hmm, that is a tricky one.
Bandit	: Yeah, I had no idea.
Chilli	: Do you know, Bingo?
Bingo	: No, but I know how to find out. (runs off)
Chilli	: Thanks.
Bandit	: No problem.
Chilli	: Can you fix that tile for me?
(Bingo grabs a puzzle on the play room)
Bingo	: World map puzzle! (runs back to in front of the toilet as she dumps all the pieces on the floor) Okay, all the blue bits here and red bits here.
Bandit	: (tries to align the loose tile in place) Nice and straight, Bandit. Nice and straight.
Chilli	: (continues fixing the toilet) This bit goes here, which means that bit can do that.
(Scene goes to a time lapse of the puzzle. It ends when all but one piece are in place.)
Bingo	: Finished! (looks again) Wait, not finished. I'm missing a piece.
Chilli	: Oh, yeah. You're missing New Zealand.
Bandit	: Oh, not again.
Bingo	: No problem, I can find it. Where are you, New Zealand? New Zealand? (Bingo turns around to find it. The missing piece is actually on her bottom) I know. I'll draw missing posters for New Zealand.
(Scene cuts to the playroom where Bingo has finished drawing several missing posters)
Bingo	: Finished!
(Bingo then goes around the house sticking the posters in as many places as possible. First on the verandah railing, then on the glass playroom door. She puts her mouth on the glass and blows, inflating her cheeks to make a funny face. She sticks a poster on the front steps, where she sees something. She hides behind the birdbath. A postie arrives on his motorbike, and puts a letter in the letterbox. Bingo runs towards him, yapping. Frightened, he rides away, much to Bingo's amusement. The scene cuts back into the fridge interior, where Bingo tries to talk with the fridge.)
Bingo	: Hello, fridge. I want to stick a New Zealand poster on you. Beep twice if we can be friends.
(FRIDGE BEEPS TWICE)
Bingo	: Thanks, fridge. (closes door and sticks poster on it)
(Bingo runs back to the balcony where she ate some blueberries, and sticks the last poster there. The last blueberry is moving, and she takes a closer look. In extreme close up, a single ant is trying to carry the blueberry away. Bingo's huge, detailed face looms over it.)
Bingo	: Oh, little anty. You're trying to carry that food all by yourself. 
(The shot changes back to normal. Bingo gives the ant a thumbs up.) 
Bingo	: Well, keep going, little fella. (runs back to her almost complete puzzle) Okay, the posters are all up. New Zealand will show up very soon.
Chilli	: (imitating a Kiwi accent) Sweet as, Bingo.
Bandit	: I'm almost finished. You want me to play with you?
Bingo	: No, thanks. I'm OK.
(Chilli smiles in reaction to this. Meanwhile, the scene cuts to outside of the house. Bluey gets dropped off home by Chloe's car.)
Bluey	: See ya, Chloe! (finds one of Bingo's missing poster) Huh? (runs in to find her family) I'm back. (gives Bingo a big hug as the latter giggles)
Chilli & Bandit	: Hey, Bluey!
Bluey	: Bingo, you're missing a puzzle piece! (shows poster to her)
Bingo	: Yeah, New Zealand. Have you seen it?
Bluey	: It's on your bum.
Bingo	: (looks at it) Oh! (giggles as she pick it up) 
Chilli & Bandit	: Oh, Bingo.
Bingo	: The posters worked.
(Thus Bingo puts the last piece on the puzzle. She then shows the end product to her sister and dad.)
Bingo	: Look, Bluey.
(Bluey gasps)
Bluey	: Dad, kiwis are brown!
Bandit, Bluey and Bingo	: Hooray!
(Just so, we hear the toilet flushing. Chilli is then joined by the rest of the family as they run in.)
Chilli	: It works!
All	: Hooray!
Bandit	: Thanks, Mum.
Bluey	: Thanks, Bingo.
Chilli & Bingo	: (looking at each other) No problem.
