The episode begins with the standard opening, showing the family dancing together. The music pauses, and Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo freeze. They point at Chilli.
Bandit, Bluey, Bingo: "Mum!"
Chilli grins sheepishly, and steps aside as the music resumes. She continues to shimmy a bit as Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo dance.
The music pauses, and Bluey and Bingo freeze. Bluey, Bingo and Chilli point at Bandit.
Bluey, Bingo, Chilli: "Dad!"
Bandit walks to stand beside Chilli as the music resumes and Bluey and Bingo dance.
The music pauses, and Bingo freezes. She points at Bluey, and the background changes from blue to orange.
Bingo: "Bluey!"Bandit, Chilli: "Bluey?!"
Bluey shrugs and runs over to stand with Bandit and Chilli. Bluey continues to dance, finishing with a the spin and jump that Bluey normally performs. The "Bluey" logo is replaced with the word "Bingo."
Bandit, Chilli, Bluey, Bingo: "Bingo!"
The episode opens with a shot of the front lawn. Chilli stands on all fours on the front path, arching her back. Bluey and Bingo stand next to her, looking excited. Bandit stands in the driveway behind them, looking under the hood of the family car. A funnel and can of motor oil are beside him. He unscrews the oil cap.
Chilli: "Oh, what a nice sunny day."
Bluey, Bingo: "Yeah, nice and sunny!"
Chilli: "Uh oh, problem. It's raining!"
Bluey screams with her hands on her face, while Bingo runs in a little circle.
Bluey, Bingo: "Aaaargh!"
Chilli: "Quick, get under the Mumbrella."
Bluey and Bingo shriek and huddle underneath Chilli.
Chilli: "Phew! Nice and dry."
Chilli walks on all fours down the path. Behind her, Bandit uses the funnel to pour motor oil into the car.
Chilli: "Oh no! The Mumbrella's blowing away!"
Bluey and Bingo laugh, and run to huddle underneath her again.
Chilli: "Phew! Nice and dr-aaaagh!"
Chilli begins to drift back down the path. Bluey and Bingo giggle and run to huddle underneath her again. Bandit, finished with changing the oil, closes the hood and opens the car door.
Bandit: "Alright! Bluey, let's go!"
Chilli: "Waaauugh!"
Chilli continues to drift down the path. Bluey runs to the car instead, and jumps in the back seat.
Bluey: "See ya, Mum. See ya, Bingo!"
Chilli and Bingo stand up and wave as the car pulls out of the driveway.
Chilli, Bingo: "See ya! Have fun!"
Bingo turns to Chilli.
Bingo: "Can you play with me until Bluey gets back from Chloe's house?"
Chilli: "I can't, honey. There's a problem with the toilet. It won't flush. Mum has to fix it."
Bingo: "But... who am I going to play with?"
Chilli musses Bingo's hair affectionately.
Chilli: "You're gonna play with Bingo!"
Bingo: "Oh, yeah!"

Chilli: "Turn it... yep, there you go."
Bingo: "I'm having a problem getting started."
Chilli: "Maybe you're just hungry?"
Bingo: "Oh, yeah!"

Bingo: "The fruit? They're green."
Bandit: "No, the little, furry animal that lives in New Zealand."
Chilli: "Hmm, that is a tricky one."
Bandit: "Yeah. I had no idea."
Chilli: "Do you know, Bingo?"
Bingo: "No. But I know how to find out!"

Bingo: "Well, keep going, little fella!"

Chilli gives her a thumbs up with her free hand.
Chilli: (New Zealand accent) "Sweet as, Bingo."

Bingo: "No thanks. I'm okay."
Chilli smiles at her fondly.
