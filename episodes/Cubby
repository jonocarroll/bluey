The episode opens on an establishing shot of the Heelers' house.
TV Commentator And that's 18 away from the century for Barkles.
The scene changes to the TV room. Bandit is laying on the couch, watching cricket. Chilli is looking around the room, hands on hips. Bluey and Bingo have set up a blanket fort, and are playing a board game with a plush puppy.
Bluey: One, two, three, four, five, six.
The camera moves to a close-up of Bluey and Bingo in the blanket fort.
Bluey: Well done, Kimjim, you won again!
Bingo: (as Kimjim) Yay! Again!
Bluey: No. Time for your nap, young man.
Bingo: (as Kimjim) Oh, yes.
Bluey and Bingo look around the blanket fort.
Bingo: There's no room for Kimjim to sleep.
Bluey: Ooh, I know!
The camera moves back to the TV room.
Chilli: I think if we knocked this wall out, this room will feel so much bigger.
Bandit: It's already big enough, babe.
Chilli: It's not. It's too cramped.
Bandit: The only thing in this room that needs to be bigger is the TV.
Chilli: What are you talking about? It's huge!
Bandit: It's not! 50 inches is no longer an acceptable size in this day and age. I can hardly see what's going on!
Chilli: (sighs) I'm getting the tape measure.
Bluey runs up.
Bluey: Dad, we need this cushion.
Bandit: Huh? What, why?
Bluey: We're building a bedroom for Kimjim.
Bandit sits up, and Bluey leaves with the cushion. Bingo enters.
Bingo: We need that one, too.
Bandit scoots over, and Bingo takes the cushion he was sitting on.
Bingo: And that one.
Bandit groans, and takes one of the decorative cushions. He puts it on the floor and sits on it.
Bingo: Thank you! (giggles)
Bingo walks away awkwardly with a cushion under each arm.
TITLE CARD - Cubby
Bluey: This episode of Bluey is called Cubby.
We return to the same scene. Bluey and Bingo have added another room onto the blanket fort. The camera cuts to the interior of the new room.
Bluey: Here you are, Kimjim. Your new bedroom.
Bingo: Do you like it?
Bingo: (as Kimjim) Yes, I love it.
Bingo giggles, and lays Kimjim down on the bed. Bluey and Bingo crawl out of the blanket fort. Chilli has gotten a measuring tape, and it measuring a wall.
Bluey: Do you think we should build a playroom here for Kimjim?
Bingo: Yeah, I think we should.
The scene cuts to the inside of the laundry room linen closet. Bingo grabs a stack of sheets and carries them off. The camera cuts to the dining room. Bluey grabs a chair and drags it away. The camera cuts to the exterior of the house, focused on a window. Chilli is inside, measuring the window frame.
The scene cuts back to Bandit, still sitting on the floor watching cricket. The blanket fort has expanded to just behind him. Bluey is pushing over a dining room chair to support the roof.
TV Commentator: And that's the story of St. Peter's.
Bluey: Dad, you're in the way.
Bandit: Oh, can't you build around me? I'm trying to watch the cricket.
Bluey: No.
Bandit: Well, that settles that, then.
Bandit scoots closer to the TV.
Bluey: Oh, can we have that cushion?
Bluey snatches the cushion out from under Bandit's bum.
Bluey: It can be a bath for Kimjim.
Bingo: Oh, yeah! Let's build a bathroom.
Bluey: Okay!
The camera cuts to a close-up of the TV cabinet, showing a bird statuette and an ant. Then we cut back to the room. Chilli is measuring along the back wall, and Bluey is putting the finishing touches on the bathroom - also along the back wall.
Chilli: Five and a half metres -- Oh, that's just too small.
Chilli bumps into a chair supporting the bathroom.
Chilli: Whoo!
Bluey: (hoarsely) Hey, mind the towel cupboard!
Chilli: Sorry!
Bingo: Look, Kimjim. This is your new bathroom.
Bingo: (as Kimjim) Yay! Thank you! But me hungry now.
Bluey: Oh, yeah. It's your dinner time.
Bingo: Where should we eat?
Bluey: Let's build a dining room!
The camera cuts to the TV, showing a group of seagulls standing on a grassy field. We cut to a reverse shot of Bandit watching the TV. Behind him, in time lapse, we see Chilli measuring, and Bluey and Bingo extend the blanket fort out into the middle of the TV room.
The camera cuts to a close up of Kimjim, sitting at a table.
Bingo: (as Kimjim) Finished eating, Mummy.
Bingo: Kimjim, you ate all your dinner. Well done. Now we can do drawing.
Bingo: (as Kimjim) Whoo-hoo!
The camera cuts back to the wider room. Chilli is measuring from the ceiling. Bluey and Bingo run past her giggling, and the tape snaps back.
Chilli: Two point nine-- Hey!
The camera cuts to a close up of Kimjim, sitting on a marker drawing of a flower.
Bingo: (as Kimjim) Finished drawing, Mummy.
Bingo: Oh, wow! What a great picture, Kimjim! I'm glad we have a art room.
Bluey: I'm going to stick that on the fridge.
Bingo: But we don't have a fridge. Or a kitchen.
Bluey: Oh, my goodness! You can't have a house without a kitchen!
Bingo: Let's build one!
Bluey: Yeah!
The camera cuts to a wall clock, indicating 10:50. It rapidly advances to 1:10. The camera cuts to Bandit, who is still watching cricket from the floor. He has been crowded right up next to the TV.
TV Commentator: And that's tea. Australia in a comfortable...
Bandit: Oh, man, I need the toilet.
Bandit gets up and turns around. The blanket fort now takes up the entire room. Chilli is still taking measurements by the back wall.
Bandit: Whoa. Hey, kids?
Bluey and Bingo pop their heads out from between some blankets.
Bluey and Bingo: Yeah?
Bandit: I need the toilet.
Bluey: So go to the toilet.
Bandit: Well, how am I going to GET to the toilet?
Bingo: It's easy.
Bluey: Head to the dining room, then go past the alpaca farm, around the cactus garden...
Bingo: ...through the star room...
Bluey: ...and out the netball court.
Bandit: Oh, right.
Bluey: But don't mess anything up.
Bandit gets down on hands and knees, and enters the fort.
Bandit: Alright. Here we go.
The camera cuts to the interior of the fort. We see Bandit at the far end of a hallway made of cushions. Off to each side are rooms with plush animals, and the walls are decorated with taped-up drawings.
Bandit: Okay, now, it was past the dining room... Er, where's the dining room?
Bandit looks into a room, the camera shows us the inside. The Queen plush sits on a beanbag throne, across from her subjects - a bandaged bear and frog.
Bandit: Wasn't there something about an alpaca farm?
Bandit looks into another room.
Bandit: Is that an alpaca farm? Nah, they're lemurs.
He continues on into a new hallway
Bandit: How on Earth do I get to the toilet?
He enters a new room. This room features two gnomes in an inflatable pool, with a third gnome scrubbing them with a brush. A disco ball hangs from the roof.
Bandit: This place is nuts!
Bandit enters an even lower hallway; his ears brush the ceiling.
Bandit: Where am I?
Bandit, not looking where he was going, bumps into a stool, which Chilli is standing on.
Bandit: Oh!
Chilli: Oop! Hey, what are you doing?
Bandit: How do I get out of here?
Chilli reaches down and gestures with her thumb.
Chilli: Just keep heading that way.
Bandit: Thanks.
Chilli: Wait! Can you take this with you?
Chilli hands Bandit the end of the tape measure.
Bandit: (groans) Righto.
The camera cuts to a light blue room, with mounds of white sheet. Bluey is setting up toy penguins.
Bluey: There! That's the penguin room done. Ooh, I can't wait to show Kimjim!
Bluey: (shouting) Bingo?
Bingo: (shouting offscreen) Yeah?
Bluey: (shouting) Where are you?
Bingo: (shouting offscreen) I'm in the library!
Bluey: (shouting) Where's the library?
Bingo: (shouting offscreen) Next to the horse stables!
Bluey: Horse stables?
The camera cuts to Bingo, reading in the library. Bluey walks in.
Bluey: Hey, Bingo. I like the horse stables.
Bingo: Thanks. Where's Kimjim?
Bluey: Huh? I thought he was with you.
Bingo: No, I thought he was with you.
Bluey: No.
Bluey and Bingo: (gasp) We've lost Kimjim!
Bluey and Bingo run down the hall.
Bingo: Kimjim!
Bluey: Kimjim?
The camera cuts to a "greenhouse" room full of pot plants. Bluey and Bingo run through
Bluey and Bingo: Where are you?
The camera cuts back to Bandit crawling through a different hallway.
Bandit: Oh, man! Where is that alpaca farm?
Bingo and Bluey run in from a side hallway, bumping into Bandit.
Bandit: Ah!
Bingo and Bluey: Aaah!
Bandit: What are you doing?!
Bingo and Bluey: We're trying to find Kimjim!
Bandit: Who's Kimjim?
Bluey: He's our child! But we've lost him!
Bingo: We're bad parents!
Bandit: Oh, man! I can't deal with this. Look, kids, where is the toilet?
Bingo: It's through there.
Bandit: Ah! Thank you!
Bandit exits left, while Bluey and Bingo run off to the right.
Bluey and Bingo: Kimjim!
The camera cuts to the toilet. Bandit enters.
Bandit: (shouting) I meant the real toilet!
The camera cuts to Bluey and Bingo running down a hallway.
Bluey: Kimjim!
Bingo: Kimjim!
Bluey and Bingo run through a "zoo" room with stuffed animals behind cushion walls.
Bluey: Come back, sweetie!
Bluey and Bingo come to an intersection; Bluey continues right, Bingo moves towards the camera. She looks into a room that appears to be an alligator habitat.
Bingo: Honey, where are you?
She turns around and enters the door on the other side of the hall. The scene cuts to the star room; an umbrella supports the ceiling and dark blue fabric walls. Glow stars cover the ceiling and walls, and a telescope has been made out of paper towel rolls and a plastic cup.
Bingo: Kimjim, are you in here?
Bluey enters.
Bluey: I can't find Kimjim anywhere!
Bingo: There's too many rooms!
They both sit down and howl. The camera cuts to Chilli wading through the blanket fort. She ducks under a blanket, and then puts the end of the tape measure to the wall.
Chilli: 36 metres? How is it 36 metres?!
The scene cuts back to Bandit crawling through a hallway. He reaches a junction, and the tape measure is already stretched across the adjoining hallway.
Bandit: Oh, what?! I'm going round in circles!
TV Commentator: Welcome back from tea. Play is about to get under way.
Bandit: Sorry, kids. I'm just going to take a little peek.
Bandit stands up, knocking over a wall of cushions and bringing down the ceiling.
Bandit: Oops.
The camera cuts back to the star room. Bingo and Bluey are still howling. A distant rumbling can be heard, and the walls begin to shake.
Bingo: What's that noise?
Bluey: Oh, no! CUBBY COLLAPSE!
Bluey grabs Bingo's hand.
Bluey: RUN!
Bluey runs out, dragging Bingo behind her.
Bingo: Aaah!
The umbrella falls over. The camera cuts to a hallway - the girls are about to run screen right, but the wall collapses, and they must run screen left instead. Chutney Chimp and Greydancer tumble out of the rubble.
The camera cuts to another hallway; the wall collapses right in front of the girls. Chattermax tumbles out.
Bluey and Bingo: Aaah!
Bluey: This way!
The girls run off. Chattermax begins to dance, falls over, and scooches across the floor chattering.
The camera cuts to another intersection; the girls are once more blocked by a falling wall. They run towards the camera, but skid to a halt as the end of the tape measure zips past.
Bluey and Bingo: Aaah!
They run off screen right.
The camera cuts to another hallway, with the walls continuously collapsing right behind the running girls. They leap for safety.
Bluey: Oof.
The camera cuts back to Chilli. The tape measure snaps back.
Chilli: Ow!
The camera pulls back to show the whole room, strewn with cushions, blankets, and plush toys.
Bluey and Bingo: (groan)
Bandit: Toilet! Sorry, kids!
Bandit picks his way through the rubble and exits to the kitchen.
Bingo: Bluey, look!
Bingo points behind them - Kimjim is sitting in the original blanket fort, which has miraculously survived.
Bluey and Bingo: Kimjim!
They both walk up and embrace Kimjim.
Bingo: Oh, Kimjim, we're so sorry!
Bingo: (as Kimjim) That's okay.
The camera cuts back to an establishing shot of the house.
TV Commentator: Nearly went for the second run there, but the call was "stay". 
The camera cuts to the TV, showing cricket.
TV Commentator: The batsman obeyed.
The camera cuts to show the whole TV room. It's been cleaned up. Bandit is laying on the couch, and Bluey and Bingo are back to playing a board game in the original cubby. Chilli enters from the kitchen with two cups of tea.
Bluey: One, two, three, four, five.
Chilli arrives at the couch.
Bandit: Oh, thanks babe.
Bandit sits up, scooches over, and takes a cup. Chilli sits down.
Bandit: You know what? This TV is big enough.
Chilli: So is this room. Look at it! 
Bingo: One, two, three.
Chilli: I don't know what I was thinking.
Bluey: One, two, three, four. Finished! You win again, Kimjim!
Bingo: (as Kimjim) Whee!
Bingo makes Kimjim jump for joy; knocking over the cushion serving as the back wall.
Chilli: Oop! Do you kids need more room?
Bluey and Bingo: No, we're fine.
They pull the cushion back into place.
The music during the credits is the same version of the episode theme that played during the collapse. Instead of Bluey dancing, we see a seagull looking around and preening its wing.
