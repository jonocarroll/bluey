Bandit: "Alright, here we go, Bluey." He puts down and opens the chess board on the kitchen countertop. "I'm gonna teach you how to play Chess."
Bluey: "What's Chest?"
Bandit: "No, not Chest, Chess." Putting out the chess pieces
Bluey: "Yeah, Chest."
Bandit: "Ok, fine." Flips over the chess board "I'm gonna teach ya how to play Chess."
Bluey: "Oh! It's like Checkers!"
Bandit: "Yeah, but a lot harder than Checkers."
Chilli: "And so probably a bit old for Bluey, right?"
Bandit: "Oh, how old are you?"
Bluey: "Don't you know how old is your own child is?"
Bandit: "I think I do, but just tell me."
Bluey: "I'm six!"
Bandit: "Are you still six? Wow."
Bluey: "I'm almost seven."
Bandit: "Well, I reckon that's old enough."
Chilli: Chopping carrots "Can I ask why you want to teach Bluey chess?"
Bandit: "To start people playing Chess."
Bingo comes in onto the wooden stepping stair stool prototype
Bingo: "Can I play?"
Bluey: "She's five."
Bandit: "Well, you might not be old enough for Chess, Bingo. But you can watch us play."
Bingo, sad: "Aww."
Bluey: "It's ok, Bingo. You can help me!"
Chilli: "Aw, Bluey."
Bingo: "Thanks, Bluey! Where's the dice?"
Bandit's facial expression turns into a "bruh"

Bandit: "Ook, I'll show you the pieces."
Bingo: "Who are the little ball guys?" Holding up one of the white pawns on her and Bluey's side
Bandit: "They’re called "pawns"."
Bingo: "Prawns?"
Bandit: "No, not “prawns”." He puts the pawn down to it's spot from Bingo "Pawns!"
Bluey: "Hello, little prawn!"
Bandit: "Ok, so the pawns can move one square forward. Well, sometimes two squares, but only on the first turn, and can take diagonally, see?"
Bluey and Bingo just blankly stare into Bandit.
Bandit: "Eh, don't worry about that. Now, this goes-"
'Bluey places down a Charlevol figurine
Bandit: "Hang on, who's this?" Points to the figurine
Bingo: "This is Charevol."
Bluey: Places down a Bonny Bom Bom figurine "And this is Bonny Bom Bom!"
Bandit: "Ok, Charlevol and Bonny Bom Bom aren't invited." Putting both of the figurines at the side of the board
Bluey and Bingo: "Aww.."
Bluey: Gasping "A horsey!" Grabs the Knight piece
Bingo: "I've got one too!" Grabs the other Knight piece
Both of them squeal
Bandit: "Ok, he's the Knight."
Bingo: "No, he's a horsey!"
Bandit: "Yeah, he's called the Knight."
Bluey: "No, the Knight sits on the horsey!"
Bandit: "Well, yeah, that's true.”
Bingo: "Everyone knows that."
Chilli: "I thought you said smart people played Chess." Mixing something
Bandit: "Well, whatever you call him-"
Bingo: "Mine's called Gallahop!"
Bluey: "Mine's called... Daughter of Gallahop!"
Bandit: "He moves by jumping!"
Bluey: "Oh yes, horseys love jumping."
Bingo: "Oooh." Grabs the Rook piece "Who is Castlehead?"
Bandit: "That's the Rook."
Bingo: "I'm gonna call him Castlehead."
Bandit: "Fine, Castlehead moves straight like this." Demonstrating to the girls
Bingo: "Castles can't move! This game is confusing."
Bandit: "Yeah, it is Bingo. Maybe you want to do some colouring."
Bluey: "No, she's on my team!" Proceeding to hug Bingo to show that Bingo's on her team.
Bandit: "Agh, right, let's just start." Moves the pawn piece from A7 to A6 "You go, Bluey."
Bingo: "Aww, I want my own Chest team!"
Bandit: "But there is only two teams, Bingo, so maybe you just watch."
Bingo: "Aw."
Bluey: "Dont worry, Bingo." Proceeding to separate the white team in half "There's two horseys, see, two Castleheads, and two.. Pom Pom Elves?"
Bandit: "Bishops."
Bluey: "And the prawns."
Bandit, in an annoyed tone: "Pawnnnss."
Bluey: "So this can be your team, and this one's mine!"
Bingo: "Thanks, Bluey."
Chilli: "Nice one, Bluey." Putting something together which looks like something red
Bandit: "Uh, look, that’s not a-"
Chilli: "Let it go, Deep Blue."
Bluey: "Hang on." Grabs the Queen piece "There is only one crown lady."
Bingo: "And one Wedding Cake head!"
Bandit: "Ah, now that's the King, and that's the Queen."
Bingo and Bluey: Squeals "King and Queen!"
Bingo: "Can I have the Queen, Bluey?"
Bluey: "Uh.. sure!" Hands over the Queen piece for the King piece
Bingo: "THAANNNKS!"
Bandit: "Agh, you can't- eh, that's just fine." Swaps the King and Queen pieces on his side.
Bingo: "Are you sure you’re happy with the King?"
Bluey: "Yeah, I'm ok."
Bandit: "Don't worry, Bluey, the king is the most important piece on the board.
Chilli: unknown sound "Is that right?"
Bandit: "Yes."
Chilli: "And how many squares can he move?" Approaching to Bandit's side.
Bandit: "Well, just one."
Chilli: "Just one square? That was a big square, wasn't it?"
Bandit's face is completely just turns into a "bruh" again.
Chilli: "Oh, I rest my royal feeties. They’re a little tired!"
Bluey and Bingo laugh
Chilli: "Meanwhile," Bumping Bandit out of the way "The queen moves as far as she wants! In any direction. Which is handy, because she has to do all the work!" Moving the Queen piece that looks diagonally, horizontally and vertically
Bandit: "Are you finished?"
Chilli: "Yes."
Bandit: "Anyway, hey, where's Bingo?"
Bingo, having placed the queen on Bandit's bottom, moving to what it's on it's way to a nice lil' picnic
'Bingo: "Ooh, it's a lovely day for a picnic!"
Bandit: "Hey!" Grabbing the Queen piece onto their side while Bingo runs back to her side. Then having to clear up the chess board to it's original state before shenanigans happened.

Bingo gets on the kitchen countertop
Bingo: "I'm moving Gallahop!" Grabbing a Knight piece and a pawn piece, and moving the Knight from G1 to F6 and the pawn to G2 to F7, already occupying the pawn already from F7.
Bandit: "Ah, no, you can't go that far,mate, and you can't move 2 pieces at once."
Bingo: "But Boulderkiss wants to visit Ms. Shinyhead. They’re friends!"
Bandit: "Well, no, they’re actually enemies."
Bluey: "No, they’re friends!"
Bingo: "They’re little prawns so they can go to kindy together!"
Bandit: "Ok, they’re friends. Ok, watch, this is how you take a piece." He moves the pawn that's on E7 to F6, removing the Knight on F6.. "See?" 
Bingo: Gasps "Gallahop!"
Bluey: "It's ok, he just starts back from here."
Bingo: "Oh, phew."
Bandit: "Nah, he's dead."
Bingo: "Gallahop is dead?!"
Chilli: "Of course he's not dead."
Bandit: "Oh,uh, yeah, he's not dead, he's just out of the game."
Bingo: "Awww."
Bandit: "I did say Chess might be a bit older for you."
Bluey: "You’re going to pay, young man. My turn. Right. Where can I move?"
Bandit: "Here or here."
Bluey: "Bang there." Moving the horse from B1 to A3
Bandit: "Ok, now, you see, it's important to keep your pieces protected. I can just take him, like this." Moving the bishop on F8 to A3, and removing the second Knight on the chess board
Bingo: Gasp "Daughter of Gallahop!"
Bluey: "Errgh!" Moving the pawn on C4 to C5

Bluey: "What about here?" Moving the pawn from A2 to A3
Bandit: "Yeah, I'll take him again." Moving the Bishop on B2 to C1
Bluey: "Aah!"
Bingo: "Stop it!"
Bandit: "I'm just showing you the rules!"
Chilli: "Get the queen out, Bluey!"
Bluey: "Oh yeah, time for another picnic!" Moving the Queen from E1 to E7, eliminating the pawn.
Bandit: "But... I have him protected." Moves the King from D8 to E7, eliminating the queen.
Bingo: Gasp "My queen!"
Bluey: "Oh, no!"
Chilli: "Really, Bandit!"
Bandit: "Ooh, it was the King who did the honours."
Bluey: "Mum! How do you beat Dad?"
Chilli: Taking off the apron and walking to Bandits side on the chess board. "It's easy."
Bandit: "Here we go."
Chilli: "I can beat him in 4 moves." Giving a bowl to Bingo, and taking the queen piece
Bingo: "Ooh."
Chilli: "I move this guy here." Moving the bishop on F1 to A6, eliminating a pawn.
Bandit: "Heh, great start." Moving the pawn on B7 to A6, removing the bishop. "Doink."
Chilli: "Then, I move him, and ask, “Why do you want to teach the kids this game?”" Moving the Rook from A1 to C1, eliminating the Bishop.
Bandit: Moves the pawn on D7 to D5.
Chilli: "And he answers, “Because smart people play chess.”"
Bingo takes all the chess pieces that were removed from the game
Chilli: "“And I want my kids to be smart.” Next move, I ask: “Why do you want the kids to be smart?”"
Bandit: "Heh, that's a bad move."
Chilli: "This is what I'll say. “Right now, you kids are little prawns."” Moving the pawn piece on F7 to F8, and then replacing the pawn with the Queen piece "“ But one day you'll be queens”."
Bandit removes the queen piece by moving the king piece from E7 to F8.
Chilli: "“And I won't always be there to protect you, so you have to look after yourselves.”"
Bluey jumps down the stepping stair thing to go play with Bingo, playing with the chess pieces.
Chilli: "Moving the piece from F2 to F4 "“But I'm going to do whatever I can now to help you.”"
Bandit: "Checkmate."
Chilli: "”Cause he's a good king.”"
Bandit: "And you’re a good queen."
Chilli: "But a lousy chess player."
Bandit: "And you turned out fine."
Chilli: "Work on the heads later, for now, just hearts." Putting her arm around Bandit
Bluey: Grabs the rook piece to the bowl thing "Here, Bingo!"
Bingo: "Ooh, welcome! First things first, you’re not dead, ok? You’re at a pool party! Yay!" Putting the Rook down into the bowl
It shows the end credits, with the King and Queen piece fading on the credits
