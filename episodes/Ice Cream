The episode opens in the Queensland Museum gift shop. Bingo, Muffin, and Bluey stand at a wall of toys and books. Bingo is reading a book, Muffin looks at a bin of dinosaur toys, and Bluey looks at a pin impression toy. Bandit and Stripe slouch, bored, on a bench. Behind them, through a glass wall, a sculpture of a humpback whale hangs from the ceiling.
Muffin reaches into the bin and takes out a blue plastic theropod.
Muffin: "Ooh, dinosaur!"
She wiggles the tail up and down, causing the mouth to move.
Muffin: "Its mouth opens and shuts! Raaaar!"
She giggles. Bluey holds a pin impression toy up to Bandit. Muffin continues roaring and growling in the background.
Bluey: "Dad, can I have one of these?"
She presses her muzzle into it, making an impression of her nose and mouth.
Bandit: "Only if you pay for it yourself."
Bluey: "But I haven't got any money."
Bandit: "Well, then you can't have it."
Bluey: "But I want it."
Bandit: "Well, that's commonly called bad luck."
Bluey: "Aw, that's not fair."
Bandit: "It's pretty fair."
A plastic 'clack' rings out. Muffin screams. Bandit and Stripe jolt upright.
The scene cuts back to Muffin and Bingo. Bingo watches over the top of her book (the space book from Sleepytime) as Muffin flails around with the plastic dinosaur's jaws clamped shut on her ear.
Muffin: "Get it off, get it, get it off!"
Stripe rushes over to help Muffin.
Stripe: "Whoa!"
Cut to an establishing shot of the Brisbane river. The Victoria Bridge spans the river in the background, and the downtown skyline rises behind it. In the foreground, a bin chicken preens on top of a trash can. It squawks.
Cut to the Clem Jones Promenade. Bingo and Bluey walk along the riverside with Bandit. Stripe and Muffin walk behind them. Muffin looks a bit worn out, and has a green bandage on her ear. Ahead of them is an ice cream cart.
Bingo: "Ice cream!"
Bingo and Bluey run up to the ice cream stand.
Ice Cream Lady: "Hi, kids."
Bluey, Bingo: "Dad, let's get ice cream!"
Bandit: "Keep walking."
Bluey: "Aw, can't we have an ice cream?"
Bandit passes the ice cream stand and keeps walking.
Bandit: "Nope, no one's having ice cream."
Bluey and Bingo follow him.
Bluey: "Why not?"
Bandit: "'Cause you had one yesterday, kid. It's too much sugar."
Bingo falls to her knees and wails. She curls up on the ground in the fetal position.
Bluey: "Oh, no fair."
Bandit: "It's fairly fair."
Bluey: "Well, why does Muffin get an ice cream?"
Bandit: "Muffin's not getting an ice cream."
Muffin runs into frame with a waffle cone of rainbow sherbet. Stripe follow behind her.
Muffin: "I got an ice cream!"
Muffin licks her ice cream cone happily. Bluey puts her hands on her hips, indignant.
Bluey: "See?"
Bandit: (to Stripe) "Ugh. Thanks, mate."
Bingo sits up.
Stripe: "Look kids, Muffin gets an ice cream cause she got a dinosaur stuck on her head."
Muffin stops licking for a moment.
Muffin: "It was a velociwaptow."
Bluey: "Aw, no fair!"
Muffin points right in Bluey's face.
Muffin: (angrily) "It's totally fair!"
She resumes licking.
Bandit: "Maybe Muffin will give you a lick of hers?"
Stripe: "Yeah, that's not gonna happen, mate."
Bluey: "Can I have a lick, please, Muffin?"
Muffin holds her cone away from Bluey and growls. Bluey recoils. She points at Muffin's ice cream.
Bluey: "Daaad!"
Bandit sighs. Muffin resumes licking.
Bandit: "Okay, okay. You can have an ice cream."
Bingo jumps to her feet. Bluey and Bingo raise their arms in celebration.
Bluey, Bingo: "Yay, ice cream!"
TITLE CARD - Ice Cream
Bluey: "This episode of Bluey is called: Ice Cream."
Back at the ice cream cart, Bluey and Bingo peer over the edge of the cart to see what flavours are available. Bandit watches, unenthusiastically. Muffin and Stripe sit on a nearby bench; Muffin licking her ice cream, now with melted ice cream on her face, arms, and chest. Stripe picks at something on his shoulder.
Bluey: "Look, they got mango!"
Bingo: "This is the happiest day ever of my life!"
Stripe flicks something off his shoulder.
Stripe: "Oh! Our ferry's here, Muffin."
Stripe and Muffin stand. They wave goodbye.
Stripe: "See you later, girls!"
Muffin: "Bye, Bluey! Bye, Bingo!"
Bandit: "Hey, kids, Uncle Stripe and Muffin are saying goodbye."
Bluey and Bingo don't look up from the ice cream. Bluey waves half-heartedly. A CityCat ferry passes along the river behind them.
Bluey: "Oh, bye, Muffin, bye, Uncle strawberry."
Bandit rolls his eyes.
Bandit: "See ya, mate."
Stripe: "Now, you have to finish that before we get on the ferry, Muffy."
Muffin: "Aump!"
Muffin shoves the entire cone in her mouth as they walk away.
Bandit: "Right, do you know what you want?"
Bingo: "Yes, I'd like mango, please."
Bandit: "Okay, one mango please."
Bingo: "An extra big size!"
Bandit: "Extra small size, thanks."
Bandit gets out his wallet, as the ice cream lady gets out a waffle cone and begins to scoop ice cream.
Bingo: "Aw, no fair."
Bandit: "Highly fair. Bluey, what about you?"
Bluey: "I can't decide. I want either mango like Bingo, or strawberry. Can I have two flavors?"
Bandit: "No."
Bluey: "Oh, no fair!"
Bandit: "Very fair."
The ice cream lady passes Bingo her finished ice cream cone. She immediately starts licking it.
Bluey: "Okay, I'll get strawberry, please, in a cone. I can always have a lick of Bingo's!"
Bingo stops licking, and silently stares at Bluey.
Ice Cream Lady: "Six dollars, please."
She hands Bluey the finished ice cream cone.
Bluey: "Thank you!"
The ice cream lady gets out a portable credit cart terminal and types in the amount.
Bluey: "What flavor are you getting, Dad?"
Bandit: "I'm not getting one. Gotta stay in shape."
He holds out a credit card. The ice cream lady holds out the terminal. A waiting animation displays on the screen.
Ice Cream Lady: "It's just coming up."
A moment passes. Bingo and Bluey lick their ice creams.
Ice Cream Lady: "It's taking a while."
Another moment passes. Bandit watches the kids eat their ice creams. A pained expression crosses his face. Another moment passes. Bandit stares into the distance. The graphic on the terminal changes, indicating it now has a network connection.
Ice Cream Lady: "Ready!"
Bandit pulls back his card.
Bandit: (quickly) "Oh, go on, give us a double chocolate in a cup, extra large."
Bluey, Bingo: "Hurray!"
Bandit: "I've got a problem."
Later, Bandit, Bluey, and Bingo sit on an bench in the shade, enjoying their ice cream. Bluey and Bingo lick noisily, while Bandit eats with a wooden spoon.
Bandit: "Everyone happy?"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yep!"
Bandit: "Good."
Bluey: "Is yours nice, Dad?"
Bandit: "Yeah, it's chocolate."
Bluey: "Bingo, can I can have a lick of your mango?"
Bandit: "Here we go."
Bingo: "Okay, but only if I can have a lick of yours."
Bluey: "Sure!"
Bingo holds out her ice cream, and Bluey goes to take a lick. Bingo jerks it away.
Bingo: "Ah, not a big lick!"
Bluey: "I wasn't gonna take a big lick."
Bingo: "You were!"
Bingo: "Your tongue was all the way out."
Bluey: "No, it wasn't."
Bingo: "It was! It was like this: Blaaahh!"
She sticks her tongue out, shaking it from side to side.
Bluey: "No, it was only out this far: blah!"
Bluey sticks out her tongue as well.
Bingo: (talking with her tongue out) "No, it was out this far."
Bluey: (talking with her tongue out) "It wasn't! It was out this far."
Bingo puts her tongue away. She picks up Bluey's tongue between thumb and forefinger and pushes it back into her mouth a little.
Bingo: "It has to be out this far."
Bluey: (talking with her tongue out) "Okay."
Bingo holds out her ice cream, and Bluey goes to take a lick.
Bingo: "Okay, that's okay."
Bluey stops.
Bluey: "Hang on, if I lick first and you lick second, you could just take a bigger lick than me!"
Bandit: "Ugh, Bluey."
Bingo: "No, I won't."
Bluey holds her ice cream away from Bingo, protectively.
Bluey: "You will! You lick first, I'll lick second."
Bluey holds out her ice cream to Bingo.
Bingo: "But then you'll just take a bigger lick."
Bluey: "I won't, I promise."
Bingo: "You will."
Bandit: "Okay, kids. Come on. Sort it out."
Bluey: "We can't both lick second. What are we gonna do?"
Bingo thinks for a moment.
Bingo: "I know, let's lick at the same time!"
Bluey: "Oh, yeah, good idea, Bingo!"
Bluey: "Okay, you ready?"
Bingo: "Yes."
Tchaikovsky's Waltz of the Flowers begins to play.
Bluey: "So, we both take the same size lick, okay?"
Bingo: "Okay. Show me how big your tongue is out."
Bluey: "Blah!"
She sticks out her tongue.
Bingo: "Okay, that's okay."
Bluey: (with her tongue out) "Show me yours."
Bingo: "Blah."
She sticks out her tongue.
Bingo: (with her tongue out) "Is mine okay?"
Bluey: (with her tongue out) "Yeah."
Bingo: (with her tongue out) "Oh, that's good."
They both hold out their ice creams. They each lean forward, but then Bluey pulls her ice cream back.
Bluey: "No, your tongue's out too far!"
Bingo gets up off the bench, trying to follow the ice cream. Bluey, in turn, follows her.
Bingo: "No, but, but"
Bluey: "Bingo, not that much."
The kids spin in a circle, each trying to lick the other's ice cream while pulling their own cone away.
Bingo: "Ooh, ooh, ooh."
Bandit: "Kids, what are you doing?"
Bingo: "That's too much."
As they spin, Bluey and Bingo start to drift down the promenade.
Bluey: "Tongue back in, tongue back in."
Bingo: "Not too big."
Bandit gets up to follow them, still munching on his own ice cream.
Bingo: "No, back, back."
Bluey: "Oh, not too much."
Tchaikovsky's Waltz of the Flowers continues, as the girls spin wordlessly through South Bank. They climb a staircase, still spinning.
They spin down a boardwalk at Streets Beach, an artificial beach on the waterfront. Sunbathers lie on the sand, and kids play in the water behind them.
They spin through Aquativity, a kids' water play area. They narrowly avoid a series of fountains as they spin. Some kids look on in confusion.
Cut to an establishing shot of the Queensland Performing Arts Centre and the Wheel of Brisbane, a large ferris wheel. The sun is blindingly bright.
Bluey and Bingo spin through the Grand Arbour, a long path shaded by a bouganvillea arbour. They now leave a trail of melted ice cream in their wake. Behind them, Winton and Cornelius stare at a living statue street performer using a levitation rig to appear to float.
They spin through an outdoor dining area. The trash cans are full, and unfinished food sits on the tables. A trio of bin chickens peck at the leftovers. Bandit shoos them away.
Bandit: "Arghh, get out of it!"
They spin past a flowerbed planted with ornamental lettuce.
They return to the Clem Jones Promenade as the last of their ice cream melts.
Bluey: "Aah! My ice cream! It's melted!"
Bingo: "Mine too!"
They both scream.
Bingo: "They're both melted!"
Bluey and Bingo frantically lick the remains of their ice cream off their fingers. A moment later, they run up to Bandit, sitting on a bench, still eating his chocolate ice cream. Bluey holds out her empty cone.
Bluey: "Dad, our ice creams melted."
Bandit: "It's a hot day, kid. You had 'em out in the sun. The sun melts ice creams."
Bluey: "But that's not fair!"
Bandit: "It's about as fair as it gets, actually."
Bingo: "Can you buy us another one?"
Bandit: "Zero chance."
Bingo wails and falls to the ground, curling into the fetal position.
Bluey: "Aw, why not?"
Bandit: "'Cause it's not my fault they melted. You took too long to eat 'em."
Bluey: "So we get... nothing?"
Bandit: "Well, you get a valuable life lesson."
Bluey: "I don't want a valuable lime lesson. I just want an ice cream."
Bluey sits down on the ground. Bingo howls sadly. Bandit looks sadly at his kids, and then at his ice cream.
Bandit: "All right. I tell you what, you kids can have mine."
The kids jump to their feet, tails wagging.
Bluey, Bingo: "Really?"
He holds out his ice cream.
Bandit: "Yeah, go on."
Bingo, Bluey: "Yeah! thanks, Dad!"
They giggle as they both hold the bowl of ice cream. They both grab the wooden spoon.
Bluey: "Huh?"
Bandit watches to see what they'll do. Bluey lets go of the spoon and pushes the bowl towards Bingo.
Bluey: "Let's take turns."
She lets go of the bowl.
Bluey: "You go first. Have as much as you want."
Bingo: "Thanks, Bluey."
Bingo eats a spoonful.
Bluey: "Is it good?"
Bingo: "Mm, yeah! Your turn."
Bingo hands Bluey the bowl.
Bingo: "I only took a little bit."
Bluey: "Thanks, Bingo."
Bandit: "Well done, girls."
Bluey eats a spoonful.
Bluey: "Mm, it's even better than mango."
Bandit: "Yeah, it's chocolate!"
Bluey and Bingo giggle.
Cut to another shot of the Queensland Performing Arts Centre and the Brisbane Wheel. This time, a cloud floats in the sky.
The scene cuts back to the bench. Bluey and Bingo sit on either side of Bandit. Bluey eats a spoonful of ice cream.
Bluey: "I'm sorry you don't get an ice cream, Dad."
Bandit ruffles Bluey's hair.
Bandit: "It's all good, kid. I'm fine."
Bingo: "Well, it's actually your job to give us your ice cream."
Bluey passes the ice cream to Bingo.
Bandit: "Oh, is it now? And why is that?"
Bingo: "'Cause you're the big daddy man."
Bandit laughs. He puts his arms over their shoulders, as they look out over the river and the Brisbane skyline.
Bandit: "Fair enough."
The last notes of the episode theme die out, and the score is silent for a moment. Then the peppy version of the episode theme plays until the credits end. Bluey dances as the credits roll.
