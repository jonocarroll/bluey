The episode opens with Bandit and Stripe sitting in a gift shop, while their kids are getting themselves entertained with the merchandise. Muffin picks up a dinosaur toy.
Muffin: Oooh, dinosaur! Its mouth opens and shuts (imitating dinosaur roar) Raaaah! (giggles)
Bingo gets slightly startled and looks at Muffin, away from the book she's reading. Later in the background we can hear Muffin playing with said toy.
 Bluey: Dad, can I have one of these? 
Bluey holds up a pin art board. She makes an impression of her muzzle.
Bandit: Only if you pay for it yourself.
Bluey: But I haven't got any money.
Bandit: Well, then you can't have it.
Bluey: But, I want it.
Bandit: Well, that's commonly called "bad luck".
Bluey: Aww, that's not fair!
Bandit: It's pretty fair.
A plasticy click can be heard, and Muffin screams, surprising everyone.
The toy dinosaur has bit down on Muffin's ear. She flails around, trying to shake it off.
Muffin: Get it off, get itâ€” get it off!
Stripe: Whoa!
Stripe runs to help Muffin.
The scene cuts to a view of the Victoria Bridge, with a bin chicken preening in the foreground. It cuts again, to the Heelers walking along the riverside on the Clem Jones Promenade. An ice cream cart is set up beside the walkway.
Bingo: Ice cream!
Bluey and Bingo run to the stand.
Ice Cream Lady: Hi kids!
Bluey and Bingo: Dad, look, ice cream!
Bandit walks by, without even looking.
Bandit: Keep walking.
Bluey: Aww, can't we have an ice cream?
Bandit: Nope, no-one's having ice cream.
Bandit walks past, and Bluey and Bingo follow him. Muffin and Stripe walk a distance behind them; Muffin has a green plaster on her ear.
Bluey: Why not?
Bandit: 'Cause you've had one yesterday, kid. It's too much sugar.
Bingo wails and curls up on the ground.
Bluey: Aww, no fair!
Bandit: It's fairly fair!
Bluey: Well, why does Muffin get an ice cream?
Bandit: Muffin's not getting an ice cream.
Muffin runs into frame with a rainbow sherbet cone.
Muffin: I got an ice cream!
Bluey: (to Bandit) See!?
Bandit: Ugh! (to Stripe) Thanks, mate.
Stripe: Look, kids. Muffin gets an ice cream because she got a dinosaur stuck on her head.
Muffin: (to her cousins) It was a velociwaptow.
Bluey: (to Muffin) Aww, no fair!
Muffin: It's totally fair!
Bandit: (hopefully) Maybe Muffin will give a lick of hers?
Stripe: (to Bandit) Yeah, that's not gonna happen, mate.
Bluey: (pleadingly) Can I have a lick, please, Muffin?
Muffin snarls at Bluey, then continues licking her ice cream.
Bluey: (pointing at Muffin) Daaad!?
Bandit: Okay, okay. You can have an ice cream.
Bluey and Bingo: Yay! Ice cream!

END TITLE CARD
The Heelers are back at the ice cream stand. Bluey and Bingo look at the ice cream available.
Bluey: Look! They got mango!
Bingo: This is the happiest day ever of my life!
Stripe just finishes picking off something off his arm
Stripe: Oh! Our ferry's here, Muffin! See ya later, girls!
Muffin: Bye Bluey, bye Bingo!
Bandit: Hey kids, Uncle Stripe and Muffin are saying goodbye!
Bluey: (focused on the ice cream flavours) Oh, bye, Muffin, bye... Uncle Strawberry.
Bandit rolls his eyes.
Bandit: (to Stripe) See ya, mate.
Stripe: (to Muffin) Now you have to finish that before we get on the ferry, Muffy.
Muffin finishes the entire ice cream with its cone in one bite.
Bandit: (to his kids) Right, do you know what you want?
Bingo: Yes. (to the ice cream lady) I'd like mango, please.
Bandit: Okay. (to the Ice Cream Lady) One mango, please.
Bingo: An extra big size!
Bandit: Extra small size, thanks.
Bingo: Aww, no fair!
Bandit: (to Bingo) Highly fair. Bluey, what about you?
Bluey: Hm, I can't decide. I want either mango like Bingo, or strawberry. Can I have two flavours?
Bandit: No.
Bluey: Aw, no fair.
Bandit: Very fair.
Bluey: Okay, I'll get strawberry, please. In a cone. I can always have a lick of Bingo's.
Bingo looks at Bluey, surprised.
Ice Cream Lady: Six dollars, please.
Bluey: Thank you. (to Bandit) What flavour are you getting, Dad?
Bandit: I'm not getting one. Gotta stay in shape.
Bandit gets out his credit card. The Ice Cream Lady holds out the card terminal.
Ice Cream Lady: It's just coming up.
The card terminal displays an ellipsis on its screen, indicating it's still loading.
Ice Cream Lady: It's taking a while.
Bandit looks at Bluey and Bingo eating their ice creams. The card reader screen changes to a WiFi icon.
Ice Cream Lady: Ready.
Bandit: Oh, go on give us a double chocolate in a cup, extra large.
Bluey and Bingo: Hooray!
Bandit: I've got a problem.
The scene cuts to Bluey, Bingo, and Bandit eating their ice creams on a bench.
Bandit: Everyone happy?
Bluey and Bingo: Yep.
Bandit: Good.
Bluey: Is yours nice, Dad?
Bandit: Yeah, it's chocolate.
Bluey: Bingo, can I have a lick of your mango?
Bandit: (speaking to himself) Here we go.
Bingo: Okay, but only if I can have a lick of yours.
Bluey: Sure.
Bingo tries to give Bluey a lick of her ice cream, but she backs out.
Bingo: Ah, not a big lick.
Bluey: I wasn't going to take a big lick.
Bingo: You were. Your tongue was all the way out.
Bluey: No it wasn't.
Bingo: It was. It was like this. Blaaah.
Bingo sticks her tongue out.
Bluey: No, it was only out this far. Blah.
Bluey sticks out her tongue.
Bingo: (talking with her tongue out) No, it was out this far.
Bluey: (talking with her tongue out) It wasn't. It was out this far.
Bingo: It has to be out this far. (she pushes Bluey's tongue in)
Bluey: Okay.
Bingo: Okay, that's okay. 
Bingo holds out her cone for Bluey to lick, but Bluey backs out.
Bluey: Hang on. If I lick first, and you lick second, you could just take a bigger lick than me.
Bandit: Ugh, Bluey.
Bingo: No I won't.
Bluey: You will. You lick first, I'll lick second.
Bingo: But then you'll just take a bigger lick.
Bluey: I won't, I promise.
Bingo: You will.
Bandit: Okay, kids, come on. Sort it out.
Bluey: We can't both lick second. What are we going to do?
Bingo: I know. Let's lick at the same time.
Bluey: Oh yeah. Good idea, Bingo. Okay, you ready?
Bingo: Yes.
Tchaikovsky's Waltz of the Flowers begins to play.
Bluey: So, we both take the same size lick, okay?
Bingo: Okay. Show me how big your tongue is out. 
Bluey sticks out her tongue.
Bluey: Blah.
Bingo: Okay, that's okay.
Bluey: (with her tongue out) Show me yours.
Bingo sticks her tongue out.
Bingo: Blah. (with her tongue out) Is mine okay?
Bluey: (with her tongue out)Yeah.
Bingo: (with her tongue out)Well, let's go.
The girls try to give each other a lick of their ice cream. They both back out. They get off the bench and begin to spin around while trying to get a lick of each other's ice cream.
Bluey: No your tongue is out too far.
Bingo: But, but...
Bluey: Bingo, not that much.
Bingo: Ooh, ooh...
Bandit: Kids, what are you doing?
While continuing to spin, the kids start wandering down the path.
Bingo: That's too much.
Bluey: No, tongue back in, tongue back in.
Bingo: Not too big.
Bandit gets up to follow them.
Bingo: No. Back, back.
Bluey: Oh, not too much.
Waltz of the Flowers continues as the girls spin through the South Bank Parklands. They cross a boardwalk at Streets Beach. They walk through a series of fountains at Aquativity, narrowly avoiding getting wet. The scene briefly changes to a shot of the Wheel of Brisbane and the Queensland Performing Arts Centre. They cross through the Grand Arbour, as Winton and his father admire a living statue street performer in the background. They cross through an outdoor dining area, the tables covered in unfinished food. Bin chickens are everywhere. Bandit shoos them off.
Bandit: Argh, get out of it!
Still spinning, the girls pass a garden bed planted with ornamental lettuces. Their ice cream cones are visibly melted. They return to the Clem Jones Promenade. Their ice cream cones have melted down to the cone.
Bluey: Ahh! My ice cream! It's melted!
Bingo: Mine too! 
Bluey and Bingo: Aaaaaah!
Bingo: They're both melted!
They try to lick whatever remains of their melted ice creams.
Bluey: Dad, our ice creams melted!
Bandit: It's a hot day, kid. You had 'em out in the sun. The sun melts ice creams.
Bluey: But that's not fair.
Bandit: It's about as fair as it gets, actually.
Bingo: Can you buy us another one?
Bandit: Zero chance.
Bingo groans and falls to the ground.
Bluey: Oh, why not?
Bandit: 'Cause it's not my fault they melted. You took too long to eat 'em.
Bluey: So, we get nothing?
Bandit: Well, you get a valuable life lesson.
Bluey: I don't want a valuable lime lesson. (her voice breaks) I just want an ice cream.
Bluey sits down on the ground. Bingo howls three times. Bandit looks at his daughters, sadly.
Bandit: Alright, I tell you what. You kids can have mine.
Bluey and Bingo: (excitedly) Really?
Bandit: Yeah, go on.
Bluey and Bingo: Thanks, Dad!
Bandit gives them the ice cream. As they try to eat it, they both grab the spoon at the same time.
Bluey: Huh?
The camera briefly focuses on Bandit who initially is seen smiling, but now has a worried look.
Bluey: Let's take turns. You go first. Have as much as you want.
Bingo: Thanks, Bluey.
Bingo takes a bite of the ice cream.
Bluey: Is it good?
Bingo: Mm, yeah! Your turn. I only took a little bit.
Bluey: Thanks, Bingo.
Bandit: Well done, girls.
Bluey: Mm, it's even better than mango.
Bandit: Yeah, it's chocolate.
Bluey and Bingo giggle. The scene changes briefly to another shot of the Wheel of Brisbane and QPAC, then it changes back to Bluey, Bingo, and Bandit on the bench as people walk by them. Bluey and Bingo pass the ice cream back and forth.
Bluey: I'm sorry you don't get an ice cream, Dad.
Bandit: It's all good, kid. I'm fine.
Bingo: Well, it's actually your job to give us your ice cream.
Bandit: Oh, is it now? And why's that?
Bingo: 'Cause you're the big daddy man.
Bandit: (laughs) Fair enough.
