Script
The episode opens with Bandit and Stripe sitting in a gift shop, while their kids are getting themselves entertained with the merchandise. Muffin picks up a dinosaur toy.
Muffin: Oooh, dinosaur! Its mouth opens and shuts (imitating dinosaur roar) Raaaah! (giggles)
Bingo gets slightly startled and looks at Muffin, away from the book she's reading. Later in the background we can hear Muffin playing with said toy.
 Bluey: Dad, can I have one of these? (presents a toy that can make an imprint of one's face which she immediately tests out)
Bandit: Only if you pay for it yourself.
Bluey: But I haven't got any money.
Bandit: Well, then you can't have it.
Bluey: But, I want it.
Bandit: Well, that's commonly called "bad luck".
Bluey: Aww, that's not fair!
Bandit: It's pretty fair.
A clipping sound can be heard, and Muffin screaming, surprising everyone.
Muffin: Get it off! (she has the toy dinosaur stuck on her ear and swings it around desperately) Dad, get it off!
Stripe: Woah! (runs off to Muffin)
The scene cuts to a view of the Brisbane River, then cuts to the Heelers on the riverside footpath, where an ice cream stand has been set up.
Bingo: (looking at the stand) Ice cream!
The kids run to the stand.
Ice Cream Lady: (Looking at Bluey and Bingo) Hi kids!
Bluey and Bingo: (trying to get their dad's attention) Dad, look, ice cream!
Bandit: (ignoring their request) Keep walking.
Bluey: Aww, can't we have an ice cream?
Bandit: Nope, no-one's having ice cream.
Bluey: (running to her dad with her sister following) Why not?
Bandit: 'Cause you've had one yesterday, kid. It's too much sugar.
Bingo throws a minor tantrum, yells and curls herself on the ground.
Bluey: Aww, no fair!
Bandit: It's fairly fair!
Bluey: Well, why does Muffin have an ice cream?
Bandit: Muffin's not getting an ice cream.
Muffin: I got an ice cream! (runs to her cousins with the ice cream which she later licks)
Bluey: (to her dad) See!?
Bandit: Ugh! (to Stripe) Thanks, mate.
Stripe: Look, kids. Muffin gets an ice cream because she got a dinosaur stuck on her head.
Muffin: (to her cousins) It was a velociraptor.
Bluey: (to Muffin) Aww, no fair!
Muffin: It's totally fair!
Bandit: (compromising) Maybe Muffin will give a lick of hers?
Stripe: (to Bandit) Yeah, that's not gonna happen, mate.
Bluey: (pleadingly) Can I have a lick, please, Muffin?
Muffin snarls at Bluey, then continues licking her ice cream.
Bluey: (pointing at Muffin) Daaad!?
Bandit: Okay, okay. You can have an ice cream.
Bluey and Bingo: Yay! Ice cream!

Bluey and Bingo look at the ice cream available.
Bluey: Look! They got mango!
Bingo: This is the happiest day even in my life!
Stripe just finishes picking off something off his arm
Stripe: Uh, our ferry's here Muffin! See ya later, girls!
Muffin: Bye Bluey, bye Bingo!
Bandit: Hey kids, Uncle Stripe and Muffin are saying goodbye!
Bluey: (focused on the ice cream flavours) Oh, bye, Muffin, bye... Uncle Strawberry.
Bandit rolls his eyes.
Bandit: (to Stripe) See ya, mate.
Stripe: (to Muffin) Now you have to finish that before we get on the ferry, Muffy.
Muffin finishes the entire ice cream with its cone in one bite.
Bandit: (to his kids) Right, do you know what you want?
Bingo: Yes. (to the ice cream lady) I'd like mango, please.
Bandit: Right. (to the ice cream lady) One mango, please.
Bingo: An extra big size!
Bandit: An extra small size, thanks.
Bingo: Aww, no fair!
Bandit: (to Bingo) Highly fair. Bluey?
