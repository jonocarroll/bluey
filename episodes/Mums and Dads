The episode opens at the Glasshouse Primary School, where Rusty and Indy are playing “Mums and Dads” in an open wooden playhouse with a blanket roof. Indy is sleeping in the bed while Rusty is on his back under a shelf with a toolbox and a stick and stone representing a sink faucet on top, working under it with a wooden toy wrench. Their green-bonneted baby doll, Polly, is seated by the table.
Indy awakens with a yawn and fluffs her pillow as she gets up.
Indy: Morning, honey. 
Rusty: Mornin', sweetheart. I made you a cup of tea. (points to the teacup on the table)
Indy: Oh, thanks. I love a cup of tea in the morning. (sips from the teacup)
Rusty: I know you do.
Indy looks concerned as she stops drinking her tea.
Indy: Is the sink leaking again?
Rusty: (nods) Yeah, I’m showing Polly how to fix it.
Indy: (picks up the pink bowl on the table) I’ll give Polly her breakfast. 
She takes the spoon out of the bowl and puts it up to Polly’s face before putting both spoon and bowl back to where they were and stroking Polly’s head. Rusty emerges from under the “sink” and stands back up.
Indy: What a good girl you are, Polly.
Both dust off their hands and start to walk out of the playhouse.
Indy and Rusty: Okay. I’m off to work now. Bye!
Both pause in their tracks, perking up with confused “huhs”. Indy turns to Rusty, frustrated.
Indy: What did you say?
Rusty turns to Indy, gesturing aside.
Rusty: I said, “I’m off to work.”
Indy: But, I’m off to work. (gestures aside)
Rusty: Mums don’t go to work.
Indy: (stomps her foot) Yes, they do.
Rusty: No, they stay at home and look after kids. (gestures towards Polly inside)
Indy: No, they don’t. Mums go to work, while dads stay home and mow the lawn.
Rusty: No, they don’t.
Indy: Yes, they do.
Rusty: No, they don’t.
Indy: Yes, they DO!
Calypso enters from the left, briefly pushing down Rusty’s ears. She sets a hand on each kid’s back to try to calm them down.
Calypso: Indy, Rusty, this is not how mums and dads behave.
Rusty: Indy isn’t playing properly. 
Indy: (points to Rusty) No, Rusty’s not playing properly.
Rusty: Am too!
Indy: (flicks hair) Are not!
Calypso: (puts her palms together) Okay, children, I think it might be good if you two played apart for a bit.
Calypso shoos Rusty off to the left.
Calypso: Rusty, why don’t you go and play Mums and Dads with Bluey, and, Indy, you play with Mackenzie in the sandpit. 
Indy: Okay.
Indy storms into the playhouse to grab Polly.
Indy: I’m never playing Mums and Dads with you again!
Rusty: Well, I’m not playing Mums and Dads with you ever again.
Indy and Rusty: Hmph!
Both walk out in opposite directions.
Calypso: We’ll see.
TITLE CARD: Mums and Dads
Rusty : This episode of Bluey is called Mums and Dads.
The scene switches to Indy, carrying Polly, approaching the sand pit, where Mackenzie is digging a hole with his bare paws, dog-like.
Indy: Hi, Mackenzie. I’m gonna play Mums and Dads with you. (briefly looks irritated) Because I’m never playing with Rusty again. 
Mackenzie: Sounds good.
Indy: What are you doing?
Mackenzie pops his head out of the hole.
Mackenzie: I’m digging a hole to the bottom of the sand pit. 
Mackenzie resumes digging.
Indy: Ooh. Can Polly and I help?
Mackenzie: Sure.
Indy steps into the sand pit and picks up a nearby wooden shovel.
Indy: Rusty would never do something this fun.
Indy stops in her tracks as she hears a thump.
Mackenzie: (from deep in the hole) Aah! I hit the bottom!
Indy: What’s there?!
Mackenzie: (pops his head up) Green plastic?
Mackenzie starts looking around.
Indy: Okay, well… Now it’s time for Polly’s lunch.
Mackenzie emerges from the hole and starts digging again in another spot.
Mackenzie: Let’s dig another one!
Indy: (startled) What? Mackenzie! (rolls her eyes) Hmph. 
Indy drops the shovel and storms off. The scene transitions back inside, where Rusty is approaching Bluey, who is sitting by the windowsill and feeding a purple-bonneted baby doll with a wooden bottle. Zara, meanwhile, is playing with a few wooden figurines.
Rusty: Can I play Mums and Dads with you, Bluey?
Bluey: (stops “feeding” the doll) Sure.
Rusty: Great. (looks to the side with a glare) ‘Cause I’m never playing Mums and Dads with Indy ever again.
Bluey: (sets down the baby doll) I’ll be the Mum.
Rusty turns to a wooden lawnmower.
Rusty: Great. I’ll just fix this-
Bluey grabs Rusty, who grunts uncomfortably, and puts him in her lap.
Bluey: Gotcha!
Rusty: Hey!
Bluey: (puts the wooden bottle in Rusty’s mouth) Time for your bottle, baby!
Rusty: (pushes Bluey’s arm away) Aaah! What are you doing?
Bluey: Playing Mums and Dads. You’re my baby!
Bluey sticks the bottle back in Rusty’s mouth.
Bluey: (high-pitched voice) Baby want milky treats?
Rusty pushes Bluey away as he yelps scared.
The scene transitions to Snickers, howling and spinning in a circle. He stops as Indy approaches.
Indy: Snickers, you don’t like digging holes, do you?
Snickers: (waves his arms) Not with these little sausage-dog arms.
Indy: Great. Let’s play Mums and Dads.
Snickers: Okay.
Indy: (hands Polly to Snickers) Polly is our baby and I need to get to work, so-
Coco runs in and tags Snickers, who, startled, tosses Polly up in the air, to Indy’s panic.
Coco: Tag! You’re it, Snickers!
Snickers: I’m gonna get you!
Snickers runs off as Indy catches Polly.
Indy: Snickers!
The scene cuts back to inside. Rusty is sitting in a wooden cradle with a pacifier in his mouth. He is also wearing a purple bonnet. Bluey is rocking the cradle.
Bluey: (overly exaggerated singing voice) Hush, little baby, don’t you cry. Mummy’s gonna sing you a lullaby!
Rusty: (takes out pacifier and attempts to get up) Bluey! I don’t want to be the baby! I want to be the dad!
Bluey sniffs Rusty.
Bluey: Whoo! Someone’s stinky!
Rusty: What? 
Bluey: Time to change your nappy!
Rusty: Nooo! (tries to push Bluey away)
The scene cuts back outside, where Winton is flapping his droopy cheeks, stopping as Indy approaches.
Indy: Winton, if we play Mums and Dads, will you pinky-promise to do everything I say?
Winton: Yes! I’m a very obedient breed.
Indy: Great. (hands Polly to Winton) Here’s Polly. I’m off to work. 
Indy turns around and leaves.
Winton: (to Polly) Uh, hello.
The scene cuts to Indy skipping over to an elevated wooden pavilion with a small table in the center of the platform. She goes up the stairs and takes a seat on a stump behind the table. A few blocks are positioned on the table to represent a laptop: a half-circle block as the mouse, a laying down block as the keyboard, and three different colored blocks standing up as the screen. 
Indy: Right, now to get some work done. 
Indy cracks her knuckles, adjusts a few of the blocks and pretends to type on the “keyboard”. 
Indy: Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
She stops suddenly and turns her head, the camera panning over to reveal Winton, holding Polly, standing nearby.
Indy: Winton! (gets up and approaches Winton)
Winton: I don’t know what to do.
Indy: You have to get Polly to sleep.
Winton: How?
Indy: Just rock her back and forth!
Winton pauses for a moment before shaking Polly up and down.
Indy: No! (takes Polly back) Like this.
Indy gently cradles Polly and rocks her slowly side to side before handing her back to Winton.
Indy: There, she’s asleep.
Winton: Now what do I do?
Indy: You take her home and put her in the cot.
Winton: Okay. (pause) Where do I live?
Indy groans and facepalms.
The scene cuts back inside. Rusty, still wearing the bonnet, is confined to a wooden highchair and Bluey, sitting on the nearby bench, is attempting to feed him “food” from a pink bowl with a green spoon.
Bluey: Here comes the airplane!
Rusty refuses and shakes his head.
Bluey: (high-pitched) Aw, does baby not like his nummy-nummy?
Rusty begrudgingly opens his mouth to let Bluey “feed” him.
Bluey: Oh, good boy!
Back outside, Indy, carrying Polly, rushes to approach the light grey Terrier.
Indy: Hey, Terrier. You’re playing Mums and Dads with me!
Indy forcefully hands over Polly.
Light Grey Terrier: Oh, okay. (takes Polly) I do have to do this one thing, though…
Indy: Make sure you give her some tummy time.
Indy leaves.
Light Grey Terrier: All right.
The other two Terriers, each carrying a wooden sword and red shields, approach from the other direction.
Dark Grey Terrier: Are you ready to storm the castle?
Light Grey Terrier: Uh, I think so. 
The light grey Terrier takes the wooden sword from his dark grey brother.
The scenes cuts to Bluey carting Rusty outside in a too small stroller. Rusty has the pacifier back in his mouth. 
Bluey: Baby loves his walkies!
Rusty spits out the pacifier behind him as Bluey stops the stroller to go get it.
Bluey: Oh, cheeky baby, spitting your dummy out.
Rusty sees this as his opportunity, propelling himself out of the stroller and running off.
Bluey: Don’t worry, we’ll- (notices Rusty is gone) Hey! Runaway baby!
The scene cuts back to Indy at her “computer”.
Indy: (sigh) Finally, I can get some work done. (starts “typing”) Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. (pauses) I wonder what Polly’s up to.
As Indy continues, the scene pans over to the playground fort behind her. The three Terriers charge in, the light grey Terrier carrying Polly in a yellow front harness, towards Pretzel, Chloe, Honey, and Gruber, who are on the opposite end with wooden swords and blue shields.
Terriers: Yeah!
Chloe: Here they come!
The children clash swords for a while before the scene cuts back to Indy, still typing.
Indy: Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap-
Suddenly, the light grey Terrier comes flying in on his back, crashing into the blocks on the table as Indy screams. The Terrier groans in pain.
Indy: I don’t understand what’s so difficult about this!
Meanwhile, Rusty, screaming, is continuing to run away from Bluey down the main path, briefly passing by the swingset where Juniper is sitting and Missy is waiting her turn. Bluey runs by soon after, still pushing the empty stroller.
Bluey: Someone stop that baby!
Indy is sitting near the sandpit, holding Polly.
Indy: Oh, Polly. Rusty would never take you to raid a castle.
Rusty suddenly runs into the scene.
Rusty: Indy, you have to help me! Bluey’s gone crazy! I need to hide!
Indy: (stands) Oh, okay. Um… I know!
The scene cuts back to Bluey, pushing her stroller towards the sand pit, which now has seven holes dug by Mackenzie.
Bluey: (calling out) Baby! Baby! 
She stops when she finds Winton standing nearby.
Bluey: Winton, have you seen my baby?
Winton: No, sorry.
Bluey: Aww!
Winton: (pause) I’ll be your baby.
Bluey: Hooray!
The scene cuts over to one of the sand pit holes.
Bluey: (offscreen) Time for your bottle, baby!
Winton: (offscreen; baby voice) Mama, mama!
The scene shows Indy and Rusty hiding in the hole.
Indy: I think she’s gone.
Rusty: Thanks, Indy. (waves to Polly) Hello, Polly.
Indy holds Polly forward, letting Rusty rub her stomach.
Rusty: Good to see you again. Oh! Green plastic. (taps at the ground)
Indy: I’m sorry I yelled at you, Rusty.
Rusty: I’m sorry I yelled at you.
Indy: (rocks Polly gently) Should we play Mums and Dads again?
Rusty: Yes, please.
Both of their tails wag for a moment.
Indy: I like the bonnet!
Rusty: Ugh! (pulls the bonnet off of his head)
The scene cuts back inside, the two reentering their playhouse. Rusty is holding Polly.
Rusty: Indy, I think mums can go to work. 
Indy: Yeah, so can dads, if they want. So… How about you go to work, and I’ll look after Polly. (takes Polly from Rusty)
Rusty: No, it’s okay. (takes Polly back) 
Indy: (tries to pull Polly back) No, I really don’t mind.
Rusty: (tries to pull back) No, I really don’t mind.
Bluey passes by, pushing Winton, with a pacifier in his mouth and a bonnet on his head, in the wooden stroller.
Bluey: Well, someone has to go to work.
Rusty: (releases Polly, letting Indy take her) What do we got to do?
Indy and Rusty: What if it’s the weekend? Yeah!
The scene skips ahead to Rusty gently rocking Polly in a small wooden cradle while Indy enjoys a cup of tea at the table.
Rusty: She’s asleep now!
Indy: Great. (turns her head) I think the sink’s broken again.
Rusty: Oh, okay. (ducks under the shelf) I’ll fix it.
Indy: Thanks Rusty!
The scene pans out to an outside view of the school. A chicken on the roof lets out a cluck.
Bluey dances as the credits music, a continuation of the episode’s soundtrack, Bach’s Where Sheep May Safely Graze, plays.
