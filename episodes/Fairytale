Bingo: "Are fairy tales true or not true?"
Bandit: "Well, what do you mean by true?"
Bingo: "I mean, did it happen for real life?"
Bandit: "Well, no."
Bingo: "Phew!"
Bandit: "But it got true things in them."
Bingo: "Like what?"
Bandit: "Like, y'know, it's not good to be greedy ‘n' stuff, and if you’re brave and honest, things will work out!"
Bingo: "Oh, yeah."
Bandit: "Hey, you want to hear a fairy tale that is true?"
Bluey and Bingo: "Yes please!"
Bandit: Laying down, while Bluey and Bingo get together to hear it. "It's about a mean brother who ends up good, and it got a curse in it, and even a princess!"
Bingo: "Wooww.."

TITLE CARD END
It cuts to a flashback of the 80s around what looks like those beachhouses.
Bandit: "This story set a long long time ago, in a place called, the 80s."
10 year old Bandit can be seen riding a bike, then zooming out to see his brothers, Radley and Stripe.
Bandit: "That's me when I was 10 years old, on holiday with Uncle Rad and Uncle Stripe."
Cutting back to the present day, oh boy this is gonna get repetitive.
Bluey: "Hang on, where's your helmet?"
Bandit: "This was the 80's, man, there were no helmets! It was a wild place."
Cutting back to flashback
Bandit: "Trampoline with no nets, your mum wrote your name on everything, BMX seats were high, music were on cassettes, and skids were big."
It cuts to Bandit skidding, then Radley.
Flashback Bandit: "Woah, good skid, Rad!"
Stripe tries to skid, but what comes out is a screeching sound.
Flashback Bandit: "You can't skid, Stripe!"
Flashback Stripe: "Yes I can!"
Flashback Bandit: "No you can't! And mum wants you!"
Flashback Stripe: "Huh?"
Flashback Bandit: "Make you look, ya dirty chook! Haha! SUFFER!"
Cutting back to the present day.
Bluey and Bingo gasp.
Bluey: "You’re teasing Stripe!"
Bandit: "Afraid so."
Bingo: "But that's mean!"
Bandit: "I told you, this fairy tale is about a mean brother, me!"
The kids gasp, again.
Bandit: "But don't worry, I was about to learn my lesson."
Cutting back to the flashback, where they paused on before continuing.
Flashback Radley: "Bandit, stop teasing Stripe!"
Flashback Bandit: "Make me! Hey Stripe, your wheels aren't turning!"
Flashback Stripe: Riding the bike "Huh? Aaaahhh!" Falling off his bike offscreen.
Flashback Bandit: "Haha! Make you look you dirty—"
Flashback Bandit & Radley: "Chook!"
Flashback Radley: "Jinx!"
It stops like a VHS tape before cutting back into the present
Bluey: "Huh?"
Bingo: "What's Jinx?"
Bandit: "Okay, in the 80's, if 2 people say the exact same word in the exact same time like:"
Cutting back to the flashback, with a reverse effect to when they both said truck, then a slow-mo with Bandit and Rad saying jinx before cutting back to the present day.
Bandit: "One of you will yell out “jinx”."
Cutting to the flashback again, with Radley saying jinx.
Bandit: "Meaning you had 10 seconds to touch them.
They both drop their bikes and Flashback Bandit starts to chase Flashback Radley.
Intense pursuit chase
Flashback Radley: "1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6!"
Flashback Radley tips over a bucket with a crab in it, which Flashback Bandit avoids a crab that got tipped.
Flashback Radley: "7! 8! 9! 10!"
Bandit, speaking over Flashback Radley counting: "If you didn't touch him in that 10 seconds, they'd say—"
Flashback Radley: "Skint!"
Cutting back to present day
Bandit: "And then, they can never speak again."
The kids gasp.
Bingo: "What? So you can't speak forever and ever?"
Bandit: "Nope, you were cursed."
Bluey: "Wow."
Cutting back to the flashback, with Flashback Bandit and Flashback Stripe playing an arcade game looking to as teamed Street Fighter.
Bandit: "The only thing that could break the curse was if that someone says your name."
Flashback Stripe: "Do you want me to say your name?"
Flashback Bandit nods
Flashback Stripe: "Ok, Band.....diddums! Ha!"
Cutting back to present day.
Bluey: "Can't you just say your own name?"
Bandit: "Nope, not allowed to speak."
Bluey: "What happens if you do speak?"
Bandit: "Oh, well, look, I shouldn't tell you, but" Inaudible whispering
If you actually curious, the loser basically owes the winner a drink, mainly a coke.
Bluey & Bingo: "What?"
Bingo: "That's terrible!"
Bandit: "I told you, the 80's was a wild place."
Cutting back to the flashback, with Nana going to order something while her kids play.
Bandit: "Anyway, being cursed is not a lot of fun when you're on holiday."
Flashback Nana: "Kids, you want your fish battered or crumbed?"
Flashback Radley: "Battered."
Flashback Stripe: "Battered!"
Flashback Nana: "How about you? Come on, speak up!"
Flashback Radley: "He wants crumbed."
Flashback Nana: "Ok."
Flashback Stripe: "Yeah, he loves crumbed. Don’t you, Ban... DISHWASHER! Ha!"
Cutting to a outdoor lunch table in the flashback
Bandit: "Ugh, I hated crumbed."
Cutting to the house thing their renting for holiday in the flashback
Flashback Nana: "WHO ATE ALL THE MINI CEREALS?"
Flashback Radley & Stripe: "He did!" They point at Flashback Bandit
Flashback Nana: "All right you, get over here!" She takes off her thongs on her feet and starts chasing Bandit, while Bandit starts running.
Flashback Radley and Stripe giggle as Flashback Bandit is getting chased.
Cutting back to the present day.
Bluey: "Geez, Nana was a bit mean."
Bandit: "Yeah, it was the 80s. Mums were allowed to be mean."
Cutting to the flashback with Flashback Radley and Stripe just poking around in the estuary while Flashback Bob was harvesting clams there.
Bandit: "Dads weren't help either."
Flashback Stripe: "Let's see who can shout the loudest!"
Flashback Radley: "Ok."
Both of them shout as loud as they can.
Flashback Bob: "Kids, keep it down!"
Bandit walks in and taps Bob.
Flashback Bob: "What do you want, Stripe, dah.. Rad, dah.. Gerald, agh whatever your name is!"
Bandit taps himself, showing that he wants him to say his name.
Flashback Bob: "What are you on about?" Looking at Flashback Stripe & Rad "What's on he about?"
Flashback Stripe: "Rad jinxed him! He can't talk until someone says his name!"
Flashback Bob: "All right, so you want me to say your name so you can talk again. Well, you’re dreamin’, mate! Y'know what I call this? I call this a good start. How do I say jinx so none of you can talk?"
Flashback Radley & Stripe: "Dad.."
Flashback Bob: "Is it like this? (He waves his hands around) OooOooh.."
Cutting to the bay where Flashback Stripe & Radley were throwing rocks? Looks like the sunset there, also Flashback Bandit was sitting there while his mum approached him.
Bandit: "I was never going to talk again. No one was going to say my name."
Flashback Nana: "I'm not going to say your name." Sits down next to Bandit "I think this will do you some good, for all holiday, you've been mean to your little brother."
