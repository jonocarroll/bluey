The episode opens on the porch of Glasshouse Primary School. Calypso is sweeping and humming. Indy sits on the steps. Coco runs out of the building.
Coco: Let's play Wild Girls, Indy.
Indy: Okay. I'll get the broom
Winton jumps out from behind a pillar.
Winton: I'll be a pig!
Winton snorts and runs down the hill.
Coco: There's no pigs in Wild Girls.
Calypso finishes sweeping, and hands the broom to Indy, who passes it to Coco.
Calypso: Games can change a little if they need to, Coco.
Calypso dusts her hands and leaves. Chloe runs up to the girls.
Chloe: Indy, can you play with me?
Indy: Oh, um...
Indy looks to Coco for an answer.
Coco: She was just about to play Wild Girls with me.
Indy: You can play too, if you like.
Chloe: Can we play something different? I'm a bit bored of Wild Girls.
Indy: Like what?
Chloe: How about Toilet Tag?
Chloe gestures to the field below them. Honey, Snickers, Pretzel, Mackenzie, and Jack are running around.
Chloe: If you get tagged, you have to pretend you're a toilet...
In close up, Snickers tags Pretzel, who sits down with his hand help up forming a lever.
Chloe: ...and you can only move if someone flushes you.
Mackenzie runs up to Pretzel and pushes his hand down.
Pretzel: (flushing) BWOOSHH!
He gets up and runs after Mackenzie. The shot cuts back to the girls on the porch.
Chloe: What do you think?
Coco and Indy stare blankly at the game of Toilet Tag. Chloe wags her tail.
TITLE CARD - Wild Girls
Coco: This episode of Bluey is called "Wild Girls".
The shot cuts to a forest path. Winton runs through, snorting and squealing. A moment later, Indy and Chloe run after him, holding pretend spears.
Chloe: Get the little piggies!
Winton comes to an intersection. He considers for a moment, then heads screen right.
Indy: I'm trying!
The girls stop when they come to the intersection.
Indy: Oh, he got away.
Chloe: Now we have nothing to eat.
Indy: That's okay. We can dance for food.
Indy draws a circle in the dirt. They both dance around it, and sing along with the episode music.
Chloe and Indy: ♫ Doot, doo doo doo, doo doo doo ♫
The scene changes. Coco is sweeping the dirt around a fire-pit. Chloe and Indy come out of a hole in a bush. Indy is holding leaves; Chloe is pretending to hold something in her hand.
Chloe and Indy: Wild Mother, we got food.
Coco: Well done! Let's dance to celebrate.
All three of them dance and giggle.
The scene transitions. The leaves are now stacked on top of the wood in the fire-pit. All three girls are seated around it. They each pretend to eat a leaf.
All: Mmm.
All three walk off to the side and lay down on a straw mat.
Coco: Goodnight, Wild Daughters.
Chloe and Indy: Goodnight, Wild Mother.
They pretend to sleep for a second, then Coco stands back up.
Coco: Morning, Wild Daughters. Who's going to catch some breakfast?
Indy: We will. Come on, Wild Sister.
They both run off through the hole in the bush, pretending to hold spears. Coco sweeps the sleeping mat.
The scene changes to Chloe and Indy dancing around a circle drawn in the dirt, with a few leaves in it. Chloe isn't very enthusiastic.
Chloe: I do like playing Wild Girls, Indy. It's just that it never changes.
Winton runs past them, snorting.
Chloe: Piggy!
She points, and they both chase him with pretend spears.
Winton runs through the forest, with the girls in hot pursuit.
Winton: Oink. Oink.
Indy: We're not letting him get away this time.
They chase him out of the forest. Bluey and Rusty are playing in the meadow.
Indy: Whoa, look.
Chloe and Indy stop to look at Bluey and Rusty, as Winton runs away.
Chloe and Indy walk up to Bluey, who is pretending to hoe the ground.
Chloe: Hi, Bluey. What are you playing?
Bluey: Farmers.
Chloe: How do you play Farmers?
Bluey: It's easy. You plant seeds and they grow into food. 
Bluey pretends to pull something out of the ground and hands it to Indy.
Bluey: See? These are potatoes.
Chloe: Whoa.
Bluey: Rusty and me have planted this whole field.
Indy; Wow! So much food.
Bluey: You can play if you like.
She points at their imaginary spears.
Bluey: Those could be your farm diggers.
Chloe changes her grip like she's using a hoe.
Chloe: Okay.
Indy: What about Coco?
Bluey: She can play, too.
Indy: Great. I'll go get her.
Indy runs back towards the forest. Bluey and Chloe get started hoeing.
Back at the forest clearing, Coco has arranged sticks and leaves on the sleeping mat to suggest bedding. Indy enters.
Indy: Coco, you have to come with me. There's a new game everyone's playing. It's called Farmers.
Coco: But we're playing Wild Girls.
Indy: But Chloe's already playing it.
Coco: Well, Chloe can play what she wants. But you said you'd play Wild Girls with me.
Indy: Oh, yeah, I did.
Coco: Now, come on, go and catch some food.
Coco waves dismissively and starts sweeping the dirt.
Indy: (disappointed) Okay.
Back at the meadow, Chloe is sitting on a stump and pretending to turn a steering wheel. Indy runs up to her.
Chloe: Bzz. Bzz. Look, Indy, I've got a tractor.
She scoots over and pats the stump.
Chloe: Come on, you can help me drive.
Indy: I can't. Coco said I have to keep playing Wild Girls.
Chloe: Oh, okay.
Indy: But I really want to play Farms.
Chloe shrugs.
Chloe: Maybe Wild Girls can have farmers in it.
Indy: (excited) Oh, yeah.
Back at the clearing, Coco is still sweeping. Indy runs up to her.
Indy: Coco! I was just talking to Chloe. She thinks Wild Girls can have farmers in it.
Coco: No, They're different games.
Indy: Oh.
Coco: Promise me you'll stay away from those farmers. They sound dangerous.
Indy: Yes, Wild Mother, I promise.
Coco: Now, what food did you bring back?
Indy: Ugh, I forgot food.
Indy is stalking through the forest, imaginary spear at the ready.
Indy: Where is that Piggy?
Winton: (off screen) Shoo! Shoo!
Indy enters the meadow. Winton is standing on a stump, arms outstretched, shouting at a willie wagtail. It ignores him, pecking at the ground.
Winton: Shoo!
Chloe: Hey, Indy, look. We've got a scarecrow, come see.
Chloe beckons for Indy to come closer, but Indy retreats into the forest instead.
Chloe: Indy?
Back at the clearing, Coco has built a stick shelter over their sleeping mat. Indy walks in, staring at the ground.
Coco: Wild Daughter, did you bring back any food?
Indy: No, because the piggy is a scarecrow.
Coco gasps.
Coco: (theatrically) Now we have no food for the winter. There will be no more dancing.
Indy: (hopefully) We could ask the farmers for some.
Coco: I told you, Wild Girls and Farmers don't mix.
Indy: But Calypso says games can change if they need to.
Coco: Well... Calypso is wrong!
Indy gasps.
Indy: But Calypso is never wrong.
Coco: This time she is. Now, time for sleep, Daughter.
They lay down on their bedding. Coco pretends to sleep. Indy stares at the ceiling, then gets up and runs out of the clearing. A moment later, Coco sits up and yawns.
Coco: Huh? Wild Daughter?
Coco wanders through the forest, holding the broom.
Coco: Wild Daughter? I'm sorry I said that Calypso was wrong. I was just hungry.
Coco comes to the edge of the forest.
Coco: Indy! Indy?
Indy is hoeing the ground with Chloe, Bluey, and Rusty. Winton is still playing scarecrow. There are now three willie wagtails.
Winton: Shoo, crows.
The willie wagtails ignore him. Chloe sees Indy hoeing with Coco. She looks upset and runs back into the forest. She sits down and howls.
Back in the clearing, Indy and Coco hear her howling and stop hoeing.
Chloe: Oh, she's really sad.
Indy: I just wish there was a way she could join in.
In the forest, Coco continues to howl.
Calypso: Coco, that's some sad howling.
Coco runs to Calypso, and they hug.
Coco: Calypso, can you make Indy play with me and not Chloe?
Calypso: Indy's in charge of Indy, sweetheart.
Coco: Aww, but I want to play Wild Girls.
Calypso: What do you love about playing Wild Girls?
Coco becomes more enthusiastic as she talks.
Coco: Uh, the broom. And Indy bringing food. And I love dancing with Indy.
Coco looks into the middle distance for a moment.
Coco: I just like playing with Indy.
Calypso: Okay. Do you think you could scare a scarecrow?
Calypso takes the broom, and hands it back to Coco, bristle-side-up.
Back at the clearing, Winton is no longer trying to scare away the willie wagtails. There are five of them now. He spots Coco, standing menacingly at the edge of the forest.
Winton: Arrgh!
The willie wagtails fly away.
Indy: What is it?
Winton: It's the Pink Witch of the Woods.
Indy: Hey, Coco's not a pink witch.
Winton: Yes. She is. She's got a broom.
Still looking menacing, Coco runs back into the woods.
Indy: No. She uses that to— Wait.
Indy smiles, and pretends to pick something off the ground.
Indy: (theatrically) Oh, no! Look, this corn is shriveled up. They all are!
Chloe: It must be the work of the Pink Witch.
Winton, Indy, Bluey, and Rusty gasp.
Winton: The Pink Witch has cursed our crops.
Rusty: I can't be dealing with witches. I just bought a new quad bike.
Winton howls. From the forest shadows, Coco watches and snickers.
Bluey: What are we gonna do?
Indy: I'll have to take her some of our food every day to keep her happy.
Chloe: Otherwise she'll curse our whole farm.
Bluey: No, Indy, it's too dangerous.
Indy poses bravely, hands on her hips.
Indy: Don't worry. I used to be a wild girl.
Back at the clearing, Coco hums to herself and sweeps. Indy runs in, pretending to hold something in both hands.
Indy: Wild Mother, I'm back.
Chloe: Daughter!
Indy: I brought you food.
Chloe pretends to take it.
Chloe: Whoa. Look at those radishes.
Winton howls in the distance. Indy laughs.
Indy: (laughing) Winton is so scared of you. He thinks you're the Pink Witch of the Woods.
Coco turns her broom bristle side up.
Coco: Well, maybe I am.
They both giggle.
Coco: Games can change.
Indy waves as she starts to leave.
Indy: I'll bring more food tomorrow.
Coco: Oh, uh.. Wild Daughter, thank you.
Indy: Do you want a quick dance?
Coco: Yeah!
They both giggle as they dance.
Coco: Whoo!
The camera pans up, above the treetops. A willie wagtail flies across the afternoon sun.
The episode music continues into the credits sequence. Winton runs across the screen, in front of the text, squealing like a pig.
