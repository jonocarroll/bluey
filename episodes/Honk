'''TITLE CARD: HONK'''
Stripe: "Hey, Rocks Socks!"
Socks: "Daddy, you play Honk? "
Stripe: "Honk? What's Honk? "
Socks: ''She laughs'' "Your nose honk!" 
Stripe: "What are you talking about? Nothing happens when you press my nose. Look!" "See? Nothing. It's just a regular old nose." 
 
Stripe: "Honk! Huh?" He looks around as Socks giggles "What was that?" 
 
Stripe: "Honk! Honk!"
Stripe: "Hey! What's going on here? Where's that honking coming from?" 
Socks: "Your nose, Dadda!"
Stripe: "My nose? No way! Let me see." He presses his nose "Hmm. Nothing. Well, that's weird, isn't it?"
[Socks laughs and presses his nose again\
Stripe: "Honk!"
Muffin: What's happening? 
Stripe: Well, Muffy, it's really weird. Whenever Socks presses my nose, it makes a weird honking sound. 
Stripe: "Honk!"
Muffin: "Ooh! Let me try!" She presses his nose; nothing happens. She looks at her hand in confusion.
Stripe: "Weird, huh? Seems to only happen when Socks does it."
Muffin: "I'll try pressing it harder." She waves her arm around, preparing to strike
Stripe: "Muffin, no!!"
