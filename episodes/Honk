TITLE CARD: HONK
An establishing shot shows the front of Stripe's house. The scene cuts to Stripe, sitting in the gazebo in his back yard. Socks runs up.
Stripe: "Hey, Rock Socks!"
Socks: "Daddy, you play Honk?"
Stripe: "Honk? What's Honk?"
Socks laughs.
Socks: "Your nose honk!"
Stripe: "What are you talking about? Nothing happens when you press my nose. Look!"
Stripe presses his nose.
Stripe: "See? Nothing. It's just a regular old nose."
Socks presses Stripe's nose.
Stripe: "Honk! Huh?"
Stripe looks around as Socks giggles.
Stripe: "What was that?"
Socks presses his nose twice
Stripe: "Honk! Honk!"
Socks laughs.
Stripe: "Hey! What's going on here? Where's that honking coming from?"
Socks: "Your nose, Dadda!"
Stripe: "My nose? No way! Let me see."
Stripe presses his own nose.
Stripe: "Hmm. Nothing. Well, that's weird, isn't it?"
Socks laughs and presses Stripe's nose again.
Stripe: "Honk!"
Socks bursts into laughter. Muffin enters the scene.
Muffin: "What's happening?"
Stripe: "Well, Muffy, it's really weird. Whenever Socks presses my nose, it makes a weird honking sound."
Socks presses Stripe's nose.
Stripe: "Honk!"
Socks laughs.
Muffin: "Ooh! Let me twy!"
Muffin presses his nose — nothing happens. She looks at her hand in confusion.
Stripe: "Weird, huh? Seems to only happen when Socks does it."
Socks laughs.
Muffin: "I'll try pressing it harder."
She winds her arm up for a punch.
Stripe: "MUFFIN NOO—"
She throws a punch at Stripe's nose.
The published version of this short cuts here, the moment before Muffin makes impact. The outro music plays over the Bluey and Studio Ludo logos.
In an alternate version of the short, the scene continues. Muffin hits him in the nose and rides him down as he falls over on his back.
Stripe: "Ugh."
Muffin slaps him in the nose twice more.
Stripe: "Ugh. Agh."
Stripe picks up Muffin and holds her at arm's length. She continues trying to slap his nose, but can't reach.
Muffin: "Why. Isn't. It. Working?!"
Stripe: (chucking) "Ahaha. Stop—"
Stripe loses his grip. Muffin smacks him in the nose again, and then starts pushing on it with both hands.
Stripe: "Ow. Ugh."
Stripe holds her at arm's length again.
Stripe: (sobbing) "Ho-ho-ho-ho-honk."
