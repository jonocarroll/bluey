TITLE CARD: HONK
An establishing shot shows the front of Stripe's house.
The scene cuts to Stripe, lounging in the gazebo by their pool.
Socks scurries to the scene from the right.
Stripe: "Hey, Rocks-Socks!"
Socks stop at the foot of the gazebo.
Socks: "Daddy, you play Honk?"
Socks climbs up to sit next to Stripe.
Stripe: "Honk? What's Honk?"
The scene switches to a closer view of the lounging area as Socks sits down and has a small chuckle.
Socks: "Your noiis honk!"
Socks points at Stripe's nose and resumes sitting with a subtle excitement.
Stripe: "What are you talking about? Nothing happens when you press my nose. Look!"
Stripe now sitting straight up and looking cross-eyed, pokes his nose - nothing out of ordinary happens.
Stripe: "See? Nothing. It's just a regular old nose."
Stripe leans his head closer to Socks who stands up and presses Stripe's nose.
There is a small raspy honk-sound coming from somewhere, startling Stripe.
Stripe: "Huh?!"
Stripe glances around as Socks is chuckling.
Stripe: "What was that?"
Stripe again faces towards Socks who presses his nose twice each accompanied by honking-sounds eerily similar to the one earlier.
Socks prances a little on her spot, tittering very audibly.
Stripe: (chuckling) "He-e-hey!" 
Stripe scratching his head glances up towards the roof.
Stripe: "What's going on here?"
Stripe gazes over his shoulder towards the left.
Stripe: "Where's that honking coming from?"
Socks points at Stripe's nose.
Socks: "Your noiis, Dadda!"
Confused Stripe looks at his nose.
Stripe: "My nose?..No way! Let me see..."
Stripe pokes his own nose again - with the same inaudible result he got the first time.
Stripe: "...Hmm, nothing. Well that's weird, isn't it?"
Socks, after having failed to hold her tittering, presses Stripe's nose once again.
Once more there is the honk-sound.
Baffled Stripe looks at his nose as Socks is giggling so hard she falls on her back holding her tummy.
The view backs away showing Muffin having entered the scene.
Muffin: "What's happening?"
Muffin climbs up to sit next to the other side of Stripe opposite of Socks.
Stripe: "Well Muffy, it's really weird: Whenever Socks presses my nose, it makes a weird honking sound!"
Socks pads towards Stripe and presses his nose once more.
Stripe's nose honks causing Socks to wheeze-chuckle and falter backwards against the backrest.
Muffin: "Oo, let me twy!"
Muffin paws on Stripe's nose — nothing happens.
Stripe: "Weird, huh?.."
Muffin looks at her paw in confusion.
Stripe: "...Seems to only happen when Socks does it."
Stripe gently pokes Socks' tummy, causing her to take a couple of steps backwards while wheeze-chuckling more.
Muffin: "I'll try pressing it harder!"
Muffin having stomped her foot and looking even more determined, winds-up for a slap.
Stripe: "Muffin NoAAR—"
Muffin lunges towards Stripe landing her paw onto his snout.
The official home-website-version of this short ends here just as Muffin's paw makes contact on Stripe's snout.
The outro music plays over the Bluey and Studio Ludo logos.
The full-version continues here:
 Muffin's lunge is strong enough to topple Stripe onto his back on the couch; Socks, having hopped a little back away from Stripes to avoid being squashed, continues to observe the unfolding tussle with a small smirk.
Stripe: "Uuurgh!"
Muffin, now sitting on Stripe, leans towards Stripe's snout and slaps his nose twice.
Stripe: "Ugh! Agh!"
Stripe picks up Muffin and after a slap on his nose attempts to hold her at arm's length .
Muffin flails towards Stripe's nose.
Muffin: "Why - isn't - it - working?!" (overlaid) Stripe: (chuckingly) "Ahaha. Stop, slapping—Owf-fuhu!"
Stripe loses his grip allowing Muffin to land her paws on his snout.
Muffin, now riding on Stripe's shoulder, slams both of her paws on the nose again and presses it down with her weight three times.
Stripe: (subdued) "Owgh! Ugh-h! Agh-ha!"
Stripe again grabs and at arm's length holds away Muffin who is furiously flailing towards Stripe's nose.
Stripe: (defeated-sob) "Ho-ho-ho-ho-honk..."
