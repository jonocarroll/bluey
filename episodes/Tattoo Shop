The episode opens in the playroom. Bluey and Bingo have set up two stools with cups of markers, and a chair in front of the fabric-roofed play house. Bingo hums as she puts more markers in a cup. Bluey hangs a sheet of paper with numbered drawings on it. Bandit walks into the play room.
Bandit: "Oh, hello! Is this the tattoo shop?"
Bluey, Bingo: "Yes!"
Bandit: "Awesome. Well, I wanna tattoo, y'know? Wanna get some ink done. Something that makes me look really tough and manly. Can you do that?"
Bingo: (simultaneously) "Oh, yes."
Bluey: (simultaneously) "Sure."
Bingo: "Take a seat."
Bluey and Bingo giggle as Bandit sits down backwards in the chair.
Bandit: "Let's do it on my back. That's a tough place for a tat, isn't it?"
Bingo: (simultaneously) "Sure."
Bluey: (simultaneously) "Yeah, it is."
Bluey and Bingo grab markers and start drawing on Bandit's back.
Bandit: "I'll let you choose what the tat is, but just remember, make it something really bad, you know? Okay? You understand?"
Bingo swaps markers.
Bandit: "Like maybe a skull with a dagger in it, and the dagger's on fire, and the skull's like going 'Yeaaaah, love it!'"
Bluey and Bingo both change markers.
Bandit: "Or a cobra, riding a motorbike, and the motorbike's on fire, like, things on fire is good!"
Bluey: "Got it."
Bandit: "The important thing is, people look at this tat, and they're like 'Woooow, that guy's tough. He doesn't look at all like an accountant.'"
Bluey changes markers again.
Bandit: "'It looks like he might be a commando.'"
Bingo changes markers. Bandit winces.
Bandit: "Ooh! Ah! Hurts, doesn't it? Ow! Are you almost finished?"
Bluey and Bingo step back.
Bluey: "Yep. Finished."
Bandit: "Ah. Thank goodness. So, super tough and manly, right?"
Bluey: "Oh, yes."
Bluey and Bingo giggle. Bandit stands up and turns around. His back is covered with a huge drawing of a unicorn head, surrounded by a rainbow and clouds; decorated with stars, flowers, hearts, and cat doodles."
Bandit: "I'll just have a look."
Bandit turns and walks away.
Bluey, Bingo: "Bye."
They turn to each other and smile.
Bandit: (offscreen) "What?!"
Bluey and Bingo squeal. Bingo grabs a stool and cup of markers, Bluey grabs her tattoo reference sheet. They run off. A moment later, Bandit runs after them.
Bandit: (feigning anger) "Come here! Ahaha!"
