Script
(The episode opens at the Heelers' family caravan at a camping site. Bluey is playing with an off-screen Bingo.)
Bluey		: Ohhh... My house is so fancy.
(Muffin comes in, grumpy.)
Muffin		: Bluey, this is my caravan!
Bluey		: Oh.. Hello butler!
Muffin		: That cup is mine!
(Muffin struggles to grab the cup out of Bluey's hands.)
Bluey		: (Giggles) Muffin, I'm just using it for the game!
Muffin		: Give it to me!
(Muffin finally manages to get the cup, falling down in the process. Bingo comes on-screen, holding an empty frying pan.)
Bingo		: Breakfast is ready, M'lady.
Muffin		: That frying pan's mine!
(Muffin drops the cup and starts trying to get the frying pan, too.)
Bingo		: Muffin!
Muffin		: IT'S ALL MINE!!!
(Muffin manages to get the pan, holding it over her head.)
(TITLE CARD)
(Muffin chases Bluey and Bingo out of the caravan.)
Bingo		: Can you believe it? the butler kicked us out!
Bluey		: Ohh... We'll have to live in the forest!
(Chilli walks on-screen from the right.)
Chilli		: Not this one, she hasn't had a bath in three days.
(She grabs Bingo and carries her away, Bingo squirming the entire time.)
Bingo		: (In protest) I LIKE STINKING!!!
Bluey		: Goodbye sweet stinky cook!
(Bluey rushes down to a nearby stream.)
Bluey		: Ohh... I'll have to make a house out of sticks.
(She begins to gather sticks.)
Jean-Luc	: Bonjour! (Hello!)
(Bluey pauses and looks up, seeing Jean-Luc across the stream.)
Bluey		: Hi!
Jean-Luc	: Tu veux jouer avec moi? (Do you want to play with me?)
Bluey		: Huh?
Jean-Luc	: Est-ce qu'on joue ensemble? (Do you want to play together?)
Bluey		: I'm not really sure what you talking about...
(Jean-Luc grabs a stick and gives it to Bluey.)
Bluey		: Oh, thanks! These are for my house, my butler kicked me out! 
(Transition to later, the framework of a conical house with a leaf floor has been built out of the sticks.)
Jean-Luc	: Oh, une maison! C'est super! (Oh, A house. Great!)
(Jean-Luc grabs a leaf.)
Jean-Luc	: On pourrait prendre les plantes pour faire les murs. (We could take these plants to make the walls.)
Bluey		: Oh yeah, those can be the walls.
(Jean-Luc and Bluey continue building the house.)
Jean-Luc	: Oh, c'est très beau! (Oh, it's very beautiful)
Bluey		: Now we need food to eat!
(Bluey rubs her belly, Jean-Luc grabs a seed.)
Jean-Luc	: On pourrait planter cette graine pour faire pousser des fruits. (We could plant this seed to grow fruits.)
Bluey		: Hey yea, we could plant this seed. Like farmers!
(Jean-Luc and Bluey plant the seed near the stream.)
Bluey		: This will grow out to a big tree with fruit on it.
Jean-Luc	: Ca va prendre beaucoup de temps pour grandir. (It will take a long time to grow.)
Bluey		: There! Umm... Might take awhile. We need something to eat now!
(Off-screen, Bandit makes boar-like noises. Both kids gasp.)
Bluey		: (Whispering) Hide!
(They both jump behind a large rock as Bandit approaches the stream with a bucket, making boar noises.)
Bluey		: It's a wild pig!
Jean-Luc	: Sanglier! (Boar!)
(Bluey and Jean-Luc try to capture the 'wild pig' Bandit. But they fail, and he runs away.)
Chilli		: Bluey! Dinner!
Jean-Luc's Dad	: Jean-Luc! C'est le dîner! (Jean Luc! It’s dinner!)
Bluey		: I'll see you tomorrow?
Jean-Luc	: A demain! (See you tomorrow!)
Bluey		: Oh, my name is Bluey!
Jean-Luc	: Salut, Bluey. Moi c'est Jean-Luc. (Hi, Bluey. I am Jean-Luc.)
Bluey		: See you tomorrow, Jean-Luc!
(They both return to their campsites, and have dinner with their families. The next morning, Bluey approaches Jean-Luc's tent.)
Bluey		: Jean-Luc!
(Jean-Luc pokes his head out.)
Jean-Luc	: Ça va, Bluey? (How are you, Bluey?)
Bluey		: You ready to play?
(Jean-Luc and Bluey continue playing together and continue building the house.)
Bluey		: We have to catch that wild pig today, or we'll have no food for the winter!
(Bandit again approaches the stream, making boar noises. Bluey and Jean-Luc talk over each other.)
Bluey		: I'll scare him, you get cut him when he runs away!
Jean-Luc	: Je vais attrapper ses jambes. (I'm going to catch his legs.)
(Both of them try to rush at Bandit, but he splashes water at them and manages to get away.)
Bluey		: You cheeky pig! That wasn't the plan, Jean-Luc! You were supposed to cut him off!
Jean-Luc	: Oh, j'ai pensé que tu veux venir de l'autre coté. (Oh, I thought you wanted to come from the other side.)
Chilli		: Dinner time!
Jean-Luc	: A plus tard! (See you later!)
(They once again head back to their campsites. The next morning, Bluey comes up to Jean-Luc's tent again.)
Bluey		: Jean-Luc!
Jean-Luc	: Bonjour! (Hi!)
(Bluey and Jean-Luc hold hands as they go to check on their seed they've planted. Unfortunately, it still hasn't sprouted.)
Jean-Luc	: Ahh, toujours rien! (Ahh, still nothing!)
Bluey		: Hmm, no fruit tree yet. We need a better plan to catch that wild pig!
Jean-Luc	: Ceci c'est notre dernière chance! (This is our last chance!)
Bluey		: I've got an idea! My dad taught me how to do this.
(Bluey drips some water on a rock and uses it to draw a stick-figure boar on a bigger rock.)
Bluey		: Wild pig!
Jean-Luc	: Sanglier! (Boar!)
(Bluey draws a stick-figure meant to represent her.)
Bluey		: Me!
Jean-Luc	: Toi! (You!)
(Jean-Luc borrows the rock and uses it to draw a stick-figure of himself behind the boar.)
Bluey		: You! Yeah, you get him from behind!
(Suddenly, a wild Bandit approaches. He begins to gather water, but Bluey jumps out, wielding a large branch.)
Bluey		: Aaaaaa!!!
(Bandit runs towards the tall grass, when suddenly Jean-Luc appears in front of them.)
Jean-Luc	: Hiyaaaa!!!
(They manage to capture the wild Ban—, I mean, boar, and howl together in celebration. Later that afternoon, Bluey and Jean-Luc are cleaning themselves in the creek.)
Chilli		: Bluey! (at the same time)
Jean-Luc's Dad	: Jean-Luc! (at the same time)
Bluey		: Bye Jean-Luc! See you tomorrow!
Jean-Luc	: Non, pas demain matin. (No, not tomorrow morning.)
(Bluey runs back to her family.)
Jean-Luc	: Au revoir, Bluey! (Goodbye, Bluey!)
(The next morning, Bluey approaches their playing spot and finds that the seed has sprouted a little bit.)
Bluey		: Ah, a little tree! Jean-Luc! Come quickly! 
(She rushes to the spot where Jean-Luc's tent was, but it's now gone.)
Bluey		: Jean-Luc? Jean-Luc! Jean-Luc?!
(Bluey searches all around their play area, but can't find him anywhere. She then goes to ask Chilli.)
Bluey		: Mum, do you know where Jean-Luc is? His tent's not there!
Chilli		: Oh, yes, I saw them packing up.
Bluey		: What?
Chilli		: They must've left early this morning.
Bluey		: You mean they're gone?
Chilli		: I afraid so, sweetheart.
(Bluey goes back to the seed sprout and sheds a tear, upset that Jean-Luc is gone. Later that evening, the family are in their tent.)
Bingo		: Mum, I need a wee!
Chilli		: Okay, let's do a bush wee. Where's the bunny night light?
Bluey		: Here it is! (Turns it on.)
Bandit		: groans
Chilli		: Do you need a wee too, Bluey?
Bluey		: No, but can I come anyway?
Chilli		: The more the merrier.
(At the bushes, Chilli is helping Bingo, while Bluey thinks.)
Bluey		: Mum?
Chilli		: Yea?
Bluey		: Why did Jean-Luc have to go?
Chilli		: Their holiday was over, Honey.
Bluey		: But I want to keep playing with him! He was my friend!
Chilli		: Well, look. Sometimes, special people come into our lives, stay for a bit, and then they have to go.
Bluey		: But that's sad!
Chilli		: It is. But the bit where they were here was happy, wasn't it?
Bluey		: Yeah. We caught a wild pig together!
Chilli		: Maybe that makes it all worth it.
Bluey		: Will I ever see him again?
Chilli		: Well, you never know. The world's magical place!
(Chilli turns off the night light, revealing a beautiful starry sky.)
Bluey		: Whoa...!
Bingo		: Finished! Ooo... Stars! Pretty!
(A time-lapse of the tree growing over the course of a decade is shown, ending with it fully grown.)
(A flock of birds fly out of the tree as Bluey walks into the screen from the left while holding a book. She is now older, taller, and has a tuft of fur between her ears.)
Muffin		: (Off-screen) Bluey! That book's mine!
Bluey		: I know it's yours, Muffin. I'm just borrowing it!
(Bluey sits down and begins reading the book. Suddenly...)
Jean-Luc	: (in French accent) Hello, Bluey.
(Bluey looks up from her book to see an older Jean-Luc, his tail wagging happily. After a second, her tail begins gently tapping the grass.)
